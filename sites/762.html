  <p>    
    <br>Let me first honour the great men of God and servants of God here today.
    <br>I thank God for their lives and for giving their lives to be used.
    <br>I also want to honour all the professionals.
    <br>We know that everything big starts little.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>I want you to pray for me; just stretch your hand and pray for me.
    <br>I need your prayer.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Yes, I'm strong!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Whatever situations you are going through..they are the soil on which faith grows.
    <br>I don’t know what you are going through.
    <br>Has your faith been tested now
    <br>or have you been tested in the past?
    <br>Cool down and relax.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>The answer to your test is in the Word of God.
    <br>Here is the Word of God – the Bible.
    <br>The answer to your test is in the Word of God.
    <br>The Bible is the food for your soul – your spiritual weapon.
    <br>It has healing power.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>It has a purifying power.
    <br>It is enduring.
    <br>It rejoices the heart.
    <br>It keeps us from error and sin.
    <br>It is profitable.
    <br>This is the Bible.
    <br>This will lead us to our title today
    <br>"Situation strengthen one's faith".
    <br>The situation I went through today -
    <br>we missed our way when we were coming.
    <br>We were looking for the road.
    <br>That strengthened my faith the more.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>Situations strengthen one's faith.
    <br>Whatever you do now that is not in line with God's agenda,
    <br>that seems to prosper,
    <br>will probably disappoint you in your greatest time of need.
    <br>What I am doing is God's agenda for me;
    <br>that is why we could reach here and at the same time, my faith strengthened.
    <br>Because what you are doing is God's agenda for you,
    <br>that is why your situation has not destroyed you before coming here.
    <br>The ups and downs we see in the world today
    <br>are practical examples of not following up on God's agenda.
    <br>You are worried and upset about many things.
    <br>Your business is not doing well, your family is not doing well; in your health, there are challenges.
    <br>Let me take you to the book of John, chapter 16.
    <br>Let me just read the last verse there.
    <br>"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
    <br>In this world you will have tribulation. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>That you are on God's agenda, you depend on God – total dependence upon God,
    <br>does not mean you will not be touched.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>Sickness will test you, hardship will test you, tribulation will test you but they cannot destroy you.
    <br>They cannot destroy you.
    <br>According to John 16:33, 'In this world, there will be tribulation. Cheer up'.
    <br>'Cheer up' means to have confidence, hope.
    <br>'Cheer up, I have overcome the world.'
    <br>This means tribulation, sickness, disease, whatever you call it, will test you
    <br>but cannot destroy you.
    <br>Whatever brought you here today...
    <br>I'm right by saying "whatever brought you here", whatever brought us here, including me...
    <br>Because everyone has limitation.
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>That is, there is something I cannot do that you do for me – you translate for me.
    <br>I cannot stand here, talking and translating for myself.
    <br>That is my weakness.
    <br>You are sitting down, listening to me.
    <br>As I am talking to you, I cannot sit down at the same time.
    <br>You too cannot stand here, talking.
    <br>My weakness is – I cannot stand here and at the same time sit down. That is my weakness.
    <br>Everyone has limitation.
    <br>This is why I say, "Whatever brought you here today".
    <br>Whatever brought us here today.
    <br>I came here because I want to talk to someone.
    <br>I want to talk to someone in Korea.
    <br>Yes – that is what brought me here.
    <br>Whatever brought you here is only a weapon God uses to preserve you.
    <br>If I was not here today, who knows what would have happened to me in Nigeria?
    <br>So, I am here to be preserved.
    <br>Your sickness is meant to preserve you, to reform you.
    <br>It may equally be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>As a Christian, whatever level we find ourselves, we always believe the best is yet to come.
    <br>Situations strengthen our faith.
    <br>As a Christian, don’t despair at all.
    <br>Unfavourable circumstances,
    <br>I mean, unfavourable situations are the arguments satan uses
    <br>to make people of God question their sonship.
    <br>Thank you, I'm happy. I discover you.
    <br>I want to join you now.
    <br>Unfavourable circumstances are the arguments satan uses
    <br>to make people of God question their sonship.
    <br>The devil wants us to curse God while under pain, trouble, temptation,
    <br>to look at God in a bad light.
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble, tribulation, prove their sonship.
    <br>South Korea  Crusade
    <br>Oh my God, I need to take my water too.
    <br>Excuse me.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble, tribulation, prove their sonship.
    <br>Prove their sonship.
    <br>Don’t allow your situation to rule you.
    <br>The rich must not concentrate on their wealth
    <br>because a man can be poor and yet be a friend of God, a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>Stop thinking about your situation; don’t allow your situation to rule you
    <br>because a man can be sick in body and yet, be a friend of Jesus.
    <br>You see people lamenting, complaining, whining
    <br>and questioning their faith in the presence of others because of their situation
    <br>instead of honouring God with their problems before men.
    <br>Honouring God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>That is a Christian.
    <br>But others...
    <br>Oh...oh....oh...oh...oh!
    <br>OK, you teach me this language.
    <br>Instead of honouring God with their situation before men
    <br>as Daniel did…
    <br>Ask Daniel.
    <br>Let me take you to the lion's den and ask Daniel.
    <br>Ask Daniel and he would tell you what happened in the lion's den.
    <br>Ask Paul and Silas and they would tell you what happened in the prison.
    <br>They were singing and their hands and legs were chained.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>They were singing, creating a wonderful atmosphere
    <br>while their legs and hands were chained
    <br>because they knew there was something better beyond their situation.
    <br>Even if God allows it as a trial,
    <br>that is, if God allows your situation as a trial,
    <br>we must not think it strange and doubt our Guide.
    <br>Because of your situation,
    <br>don't cut off your dependence on God,
    <br>your duty to God,
    <br>your communion with God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We are here with different situations.
    <br>You are saying because of that sickness, you are not a child of God. No!
    <br>Because you are poor, you say you are not a child of God; your prayer is not answered. No!
    <br>These are the things satan uses
    <br>to take you out of your position.
    <br>Your enemies think they are hurting you
    <br>not knowing that their hatred, evil plans, envy and jealousy
    <br>are weapons God uses to preserve you.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>There is one person who can get you out of God's will;
    <br>that is yourself.
    <br>Sickness cannot get you out of God's will.
    <br>Your enemy, satan, demon cannot get you out of God's will.
    <br>There is one person who can get you out of God's will;
    <br>that is yourself.
    <br>Let me take you to the book of Luke 22:32.
    <br>Here we end our message for today, and we can move around to attend to the sick.
    <br>We believe God will give us the grace to continue.
    <br>I should not talk as if I knew that we would continue.
    <br>Oh yes.
    <br>Let's go to the book of Luke 22:32.
    <br>"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail."
    <br>What is good for Simon in the Bible is equally good for all.
    <br>He says, "I pray you, Simon, that your faith will not fail".
    <br>This means there is something that will challenge our faith -
    <br>something that will test our faith.
    <br>This is what we are going through now.
    <br>This is a prophetic word that a time like this – a time for sickness, affliction, poverty to test…
    <br>So, why are we lamenting when sickness comes to test?
    <br>Why are we murmuring
    <br>when hardship comes, as a Christian, to test,
    <br>when the Bible says, I pray your faith will not fail?
    <br>He never promised to keep us away from trouble.
    <br>He never promised to keep us away from tribulation.
    <br>What you are going through, He never promised to keep you away from it.
    <br>He never promised to keep us away from all these – hardship, trouble
    <br>but He promised to see us through, if you are with Him.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>I'm hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He says I should go and attend to the sick ones.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>I think I need to "chip in" a word before we go for healing.
    <br>Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings
    <br>are hindered by the way and manner we go about the issue of money.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>I repeat.
    <br>Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings
    <br>are hindered today
    <br>by the way and manner we go about the issue of money, money, money.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>No one can give money from his heart before healing.
    <br>Anybody that gives money before healing is giving that money on a condition -
    <br>heal me, have money.
    <br>Healing and God's blessings should not be exchanged with money.
    <br>When we give freely
    <br>as we have been given freely,
    <br>God will raise His people to bless us abundantly.
    <br>Anything that does not come from the heart is a sin.
    <br>If someone gives money before healing, he is not giving it from his heart;
    <br>he is giving it to receive healing.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>Anything that is not from the heart is a sin.
    <br>This is why it's so difficult to receive healing and deliverance today.
    <br>All this - God's blessings, are hindered by the manner and way we go about money.
    <br>Thank you.
