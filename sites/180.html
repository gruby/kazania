    <br>As Wise Man Harry moves among the congregation, he lays hands on them one after the other
    <br>and uproots whatever that is not of God in their lives,
    <br>and as he does, evil spirits begin to flee at the mention of the name Jesus Christ.
    <br>On touching this lady, the evil spirit hidden within her is illuminated and exposed by the light of God.
    <br>Let's see how she was delivered.
    <br>POSSESSED PROPHETESS: Demons Behind Africa's Bondage Exposed!!!
    <br>- I hate your eyes.
    <br>- Why?
    <br>There is fire in your eyes.
    <br>Don't look at me.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am sent.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am an evil spirit, mighty big spirit sent to destroy her great ministry.
    <br>You are sent to destroy her ministry?
    <br>Yes. She is a prophetess.
    <br>Her husband is a big prophet.
    <br>I don't want them to manifest, they want to liberate the world. No.
    <br>Who are they?
    <br>They live in the USA.
    <br>They said they are going to come back and change Africa. Who are they?
    <br>We have bound Africa.
    <br>You see, the African continent will remain down.
    <br>We don't want this continent to be liberated.
    <br>Who are they to say they will liberate Africa?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>We are agents sent from the kingdom of darkness to destroy shining light.
    <br>- How many of you are there?
    <br>- We are many.
    <br>What will you do?
    <br>Begin to mention, one...
    <br>I don't need to tell you.
    <br>There are spirits from under the earth, under the sea and on top of the sky.
    <br>We fly and want to stop great ministries.
    <br>How do you operate?
    <br>Many times, we would come and tell them...
    <br>The Lord would say, "Do this" but we would tell them, "Don't do it, wait"
    <br>and so delay the work of God.
    <br>She can pray all night till dawn but I put sickness all over her body
    <br>so that when she wants to pray, she would feel pain but she will still pray.
    <br>She loves the Lord.
    <br>She and her husband are great people.
    <br>What will you do?
    <br>You know what, in the USA, a lot of people came to their house to watch T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They watch T.B. Joshua 24/7 in their house.
    <br>They don't watch news any longer.
    <br>How does Emmanuel TV affect you?
    <br>Their house is covered, their home is blessed,
    <br>we don't want it, we don't want them to be blessed.
    <br>He was supposed to create a lot of things but we blocked it
    <br>and tormented her husband in the USA.
    <br>What will you do?
    <br>How did you block him?
    <br>We delayed him and caused the favour that the Lord has put upon him not to shine.
    <br>We caused people to pay him for everything because he is so good.
    <br>He gives everybody, gives, gives, gives.
    <br>How do you attack churches that have light?
    <br>No, I am not sent to the Christians but I am sent to those who carry the fire.
    <br>I would come and lie, deceive and distract them
    <br>and try to take them away from their purpose but they are so stubborn.
    <br>They watch T.B. Joshua all the time and refuse to lose their focus.
    <br>You said that you are sent to attack churches.
    <br>How do you attack churches that have the light of God?
    <br>I come through the people who come to them.
    <br>They come like angels of light but they are not truthful.
    <br>They came like Christians but they are not coming as Christians.
    <br>I come through them to stop them.
    <br>Don't ask me questions anymore, please.
    <br>She can worship. She worships, worships, worships.
    <br>She worships the Lord but I would say, "No, don't worship like that" and I seized her voice.
    <br>You said that they are watching Emmanuel TV at home
    <br>and they are watching Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What happens in any house where they watch Emmanuel TV?
    <br>- What happens to you?
    <br>- We cannot operate.
    <br>- Why can you not operate?
    <br>- There is no way.
    <br>We don't want them to watch it but they keep watching it.
    <br>They made the police to watch Emmanuel TV in their house.
    <br>We don't want it.
    <br>The FBI came to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Anybody who comes, watches Emmanuel TV on their iPad, iPhone and iPod, everything.
    <br>Emmanuel TV - what is all this?
    <br>They drive with Emmanuel TV in their car. What is all this?
    <br>Leave me alone. 
    <br>I want to go.
    <br>Let me go.
    <br>I want to go, I'm tired.
    <br>Look here.
    <br>You said that you come as an anger of light to deceive the people of God.
    <br>How do you deceive them?
    <br>They are so good and trust everybody who talks about Jesus.
    <br>So, we would enter those who talk about Jesus but are not true,
    <br>come to them and through them, would do something in their lives.
    <br>That is how we operate.
    <br>Like what? What are the things you would do in their lives?
    <br>We would stop their prayer life, that is all we can do.
    <br>We would hold their finances.
    <br>How do you stop their prayer life?
    <br>They used to pray a lot and each time they wanted to pray, we would say,
    <br>"Do this, go to this place, do that."
    <br>Like what? Mention one example.
    <br>If they want to pray, we would say, "No, you have a call, check on this business."
    <br>That is how we distract them with things so that when they want to pray,
    <br>if they had to pray for six hours, they would pray for thirty minutes.
    <br>You will tell them to check some business?
    <br>Yes. I will tell them to do something different like do some house chores
    <br>and so they would pray only a little.
    <br>I don't want her to worship the way she worships, Heaven shakes when this girl worships.
    <br>She can sing, we held her voice.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How did you enter her body?
    <br>Is it not through people who call themselves Christians but are not true Christians?
    <br>How?
    <br>I used them to come to her and say, "Sister, come let's pray."
    <br>She likes prayer and delivers people.
    <br>She is a deliverance minister and a prophetess.
    <br>She prayed for somebody?
    <br>Yes, but I came through those who are not strong Christians;
    <br>those who say they are Christians but their one leg is here and the other there.
    <br>So, they would trust them, take their things, laugh, eat and share with them.
    <br>Is that how you entered her?
    <br>That is how I entered her.
    <br>In her family, there is a familiar spirit in her father's compound that is destructive.
    <br>The evil spirit is linked to her because she is born into the family.
    <br>Her family knows idols and would say that they go to church
    <br>but they would still go back to the things they sing, dance and sacrifice to.
    <br>I got into her, it is not her fault, she is a child of God
    <br>but because she is connected to a family that is not sincere;
    <br>they said they know God but would still go behind.
    <br>So, I used that means.
    <br>You said that you have bound the continent of Africa and that Africa would not rise.
    <br>How did you bind Africa?
    <br>We made them poor.
    <br>We made them to have sickness.
    <br>We put it on Africa but she is sent to the world.
    <br>She is sent to liberate this continent of Africa.
    <br>We said, "No way, can we let Africa go!"
    <br>She said that Africa must be saved but we said, "No!"
    <br>Can I go, Wise Man?
    <br>You cannot go.
    <br>You said that you watch T.B. Joshua every day in their house.
    <br>When people ask about T.B. Joshua, what do you tell them?
    <br>Do you know what?
    <br>A lot of people who hated T.B. Joshua in the USA said that he is a fake man
    <br>and that you did not have to listen to him because he is not a good prophet.
    <br>They would tell people to come and watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So, they would bring people.
    <br>People come to their home and they would keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>By the time they leave her home, they would say,
    <br>"O, he is a real prophet of God, we are sorry"
    <br>and would then start to watch him in their houses.
    <br>Do you know what happened?
    <br>She wanted to come here but I stopped her many times.
    <br>She wanted a visa but I kept pushing her so that she wouldn't get a visa to come to this country.
    <br>Do you know what?
    <br>When she was about to come here, I stole her money.
    <br>She cried, "Father!" and the Father made a way for her and she came here.
    <br>How did you steal her money when she wanted to come to The SCOAN?
    <br>She went for grocery shopping and she had a lot of money in her pocket book.
    <br>She went for grocery shopping and I made her to forget where she put her pocket book.
    <br>Somebody opened it and took all the money she had.
    <br>I blocked her account; she has an account with The Bank Of America.
    <br>I made them remove the money from her account.
    <br>I didn't want her to come here but the Lord opened a way and gave her money.
    <br>They are very rich but I made them to struggle.
    <br>Let me go.
    <br>For how long did she try to come here but you stopped her?
    <br>So many times.
    <br>She wrote to Emmanuel TV a couple of times that she wanted to come here.
    <br>How many times did you stop her from coming here?
    <br>I can't count it; a lot of times.
    <br>What was the efforts she made to come but you did not allow her to come?
    <br>She went for a visa but I kept postponing the visa.
    <br>I made her to have to pay with her credit card but the company that works
    <br>with her credit card, blocked it.
    <br>So, the money could not go through to pay for her visa.
    <br>Please, I want to go.
    <br>Now she has come here. Why could you not stop her from coming?
    <br>Because the Lord is with her and she is a great woman of God.
    <br>The Lord wants her to be delivered.
    <br>Please, I want to go!
    <br>Leave me alone!
    <br>I paralysed her hand and the right side of her body so she couldn't pray
    <br>but she kept on praying.
    <br>How does she normally prophesy to people?
    <br>When she starts praying, the Lord will show her many things
    <br>and she will tell the people and they will repent and be serious.
    <br>We don't want people to be serious with God
    <br>but she would make them serious with God.
    <br>She is so straight with her work with God, she fears God a lot.
    <br>What is the name of the ministry?
    <br>End Time Ministries.
    <br>End Time Ministries?
    <br>Yes, it's a deliverance ministry.
    <br>They used to deliver people?
    <br>Yes, they pray, deliver and know the Word of God so much.
    <br>They fear God in their house.
    <br>I don't want them to shine. I don't want God to get into people's hearts.
    <br>I want people to remain bad forever.
    <br>- Now, your time has expired.
    <br>- Yes, let me go.
    <br>Look here!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, all over your body, from your head to your toe.
    <br>Holy Ghost, fire, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Will you save her family and her parents?
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out! You are going.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost, fire, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>All over your body, fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>POSSESSED PROPHETESS: Demons Behind Africa's Bondage Exposed!!!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>You are delivered in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sister?
    <br>I am great, Man of God.
    <br>You said that you are many evil spirits living inside of this woman.
    <br>No, I am a woman of God.
    <br>- You are a woman of God?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Those evil spirits that have been tormenting you, your ministry
    <br>and your life, are out of you.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Jesus Christ has set you free.
    <br>Amen! Thank You, Father, I worship You!
    <br>I magnify Your name and give You all the praise! You are worthy!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Pastor Lucy Teneh.
    <br>I'm co-pastor with my husband who is a prophet of End Time Ministries in the USA.
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV consistently and I saw a lot of ministers of God,
    <br>children of God, prayer warriors going through different manifestations
    <br>and being possessed by evil spirits.
    <br>So, I had to communicate via e-mail to this ministry, The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>With the reply, I realised that many things were inconsistent within a certain period of my life.
    <br>I was passing through a state of procrastination.
    <br>As a woman of God that God has used during a certain period,
    <br>the Lord would tell me to create websites for evangelism, where youth can interact
    <br>and stay away from communications on the Internet that could hamper their Christian lives.
    <br>I mean different websites.
    <br>Sometimes, I would procrastinate in creating those websites.
    <br>At the end of it, I created two websites, built two websites,
    <br>spent so much money but didn't use them.
    <br>Each time I wanted to do something, I would think, "I'll do it tomorrow."
    <br>The Lord also told me to start foundations for less privileged people
    <br>and children who are victims of HIV/AIDS.
    <br>Each time I want to start it, I will say, "I'll do it tomorrow."
    <br>This continued until my husband got upset with me
    <br>that something was actually wrong and like a prophet of God,
    <br>he told me that I needed deliverance.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said something, he said there are three levels in the Spirit,
    <br>deep, deeper and deepest and the deepest is the one who can solve the problems of the others.
    <br>And God has blessed the man in the Synagogue and the wise men with the deepest.
    <br>When I came here, I knew I would get results but I didn't expect myself to speak the way I did.
    <br>She says she didn't expect herself to be saying all these kinds of things.
    <br>This is to tell you that you may not know yourself.
    <br>Speak to yourself.
    <br>[I may not know myself.]
    <br>That is it. 
    <br>You may not know yourself.
    <br>I would advise...
    <br>I have read, I pursued my Ph.D in Ministries after my medical career
    <br>and most of the books will tell you that a child of God can never be possessed,
    <br>neither will a minister of God come under such kind of bondage
    <br>but I want to tell you that it is real.
    <br>One thing I realised was that when Paul got converted
    <br>the Lord sent Ananias to lay his hands on Paul to deliver him before he could start the ministry.
    <br>So, I think this deliverance process is very important.
    <br>I had been prayed for by great men of God before who laid hands on me but
    <br>I never experienced what Wise Man Harry did with just one laying of hands,
    <br>and I started manifesting and got delivered.
    <br>Today, I'm delivered.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
