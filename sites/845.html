  <p>    
    <br>Can I talk to you, sir?
    <br>You are addicted to hard drugs.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>This is hard drugs and you believe God can set you free.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Hard drugs - he's addicted to hard drugs.
    <br>After taking it, he hears voices everywhere; there is a spirit tormenting him.
    <br>I'm his sister; I brought him here and whatever you said is very true.
    <br>He has been using drugs but that has always been the problem.
    <br>I've actually tried to help him.
    <br>I've not been able to, so I brought him here for help.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Jaspal Bharya.
    <br>I was born in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania
    <br>I went for further education to Birmingham.
    <br>The man of God blessed me and I felt a very light, relieving feeling.
    <br>He prophesied that I am addicted to hard drugs - it is definitely true.
    <br>When I was young, I was living in a joined family.
    <br>Things that happened in front of my eyes, within our home would really stress me out.
    <br>On top of that, my education, homework and all that just piled up on me.
    <br>Smoking was an outlet for me.
    <br>I used to hide away from my parents and smoke.
    <br>I got into smoking cannabis.
    <br>When I went for further education to Birmingham, I continued smoking cannabis and hash as well.
    <br>It got to a point where I started selling my things for money to buy drugs,
    <br>such as my mobile phone, my gold bracelet, my gold chain -
    <br>anything I could sell to get money to buy drugs.
    <br>It got to a point where I could actually jump over fences to go and buy drugs.
    <br>I was a teenager in upper school when I started taking drugs,
    <br>and it was in 1994 when I went to Birmingham to do A-Levels.
    <br>I have been taking different kinds of drugs and that includes smoking, from 1994 until 2016.
    <br>That's approximately 22 years.
    <br>The drugs took over me and I wasn't within myself.
    <br>Basically, I lost my patience, I could not concentrate in studies, I could not focus,
    <br>and I lost my temper for no reason.
    <br>I wasn't within myself and I was kind of confused too.
    <br>On a daily basis, how much of these drugs would you take?
    <br>In the morning, afternoon - just describe to us.
    <br>It became like the way people have breakfast, and then lunch, and then dinner.
    <br>I was like taking drugs in that way -
    <br>smoking which included cannabis, hash, and cocaine.
    <br>It really spoiled my health.
    <br>None of my family members respected me - they looked down at me, downgraded me.
    <br>I felt really low within myself, I was really deeply humiliated.
    <br>I felt responsible for all the problems in this world.
    <br>I did a lot of self-harm to myself.
    <br>Having seen and experienced the bad things happening around me
    <br>and because I have got an eye for detail -
    <br>when I saw the unpleasantness, bad things around me,
    <br>it affected me to take it out with the drugs.
    <br>My father and my mother stopped giving me pocket money because I would spend it on drugs.
    <br>My parents got worried that if they gave me money, I would spend it on drugs,
    <br>and that would spoil my health.
    <br>My wife and children have separated from me because of drugs.
    <br>What efforts did you make on your own to try and get out of this addiction or stop taking the drugs?
    <br>I tried the patches but it did not work.
    <br>I tried the nicorette chewing gum as well
    <br>but I would be waiting for a bus at the bus stop with a nicorette,
    <br>chewing the gum and smoking as well and thinking, "Nothing is going anywhere.
    <br>Everything is messed up. I don't see any hope".
    <br>But when the man of God touched me, I felt relieved, light and relaxed.
    <br>You said you tried so many things on the outside before to try and stop this drug addiction.
    <br>Finally you came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Just tell us: How did you find out about The SCOAN?
    <br>I found out from my father who has been here with my mother
    <br>and my two younger brothers and their wives and children.
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua gave you that prophecy and prayed for you.
    <br>Can you just tell us again: When he prayed for you,
    <br>what happened to you at that moment as he stretched his hand to pray for you?
    <br>It is like when someone is in their own bubble -
    <br>when he touched my forehead, as you saw on the screen, I kind of woke up, it burst my bubble.
    <br>That is the experience our brother is sharing as if something just came out
    <br>as the Prophet gave him that prophecy and prayed for him in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Ever since the word of prophecy, what are the changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>I sleep a lot better, wake up a lot fresher, and I can breathe a lot better.
    <br>What the man of God said is true and if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have felt this good.
    <br>Ok, so you mean to say, sir, that since you received that prophecy,
    <br>just tell us - have you taken any more of those hard drugs you were taking before?
    <br>Not at all. Since the prayer I have lost the urge and craving for any drugs.
    <br>That includes smoking.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Brother, we believe you are in a position to give a word of advice to viewers all over the world,
    <br>especially those who may be under the bondage of this kind of addiction.
    <br>What do you really want to advice them?
    <br>I advise people who are taking drugs to stop taking it,
    <br>and people who want to start taking drugs to not do it. It's not worth getting into it.
    <br>Smoking is highly addictive. Don't start!
    <br>Smoking causes mucus and it makes your blood sticky.
    <br>That's just two of the negative things that come with it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We know that the evidence of Jesus is lives changed and our brother has taken a step
    <br>in his new life in Christ Jesus since that word of prophecy last week,
    <br>and the deliverance he received from this drug addiction.
    <br>We pray that God will give him the grace to maintain his relationship with God
    <br>and we know that the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
