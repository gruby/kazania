    <br>My Helper oh
    <br>Oh God You are
    <br>Have your seat. Thank you.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Oluranlowo
    <br>Helper
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We will talk about forgiveness.
    <br>We will take our reading from the Book of Luke 6.
    <br>I will start my reading from verse 37.
    <br>Judging others.
    <br>Verse 37.
    <br>"Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
    <br>Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.
    <br>Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
    <br>Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure..."
    <br>I trust you. I want you to say that with your mouth.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let us take this single sentence,
    <br>"Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us".
    <br>In the same vein, help us as we help those who need help.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>You say, "Help me as I help those who need help".
    <br>How many of us can say here authoritatively, "Lord, help me as I help those who need help"?
    <br>How many of you can authoritatively ask God to help you
    <br>the same way you help those who are in need of your help?
    <br>You know we help for reasons - selfish, classic and material reasons
    <br>and our Christian life is as simple as that.
    <br>This is the Christian life for you.
    <br>The way we help is the way we will be helped.
    <br>The way you love is the way you will be loved, as a Christian.
    <br>The way you forgive is the way you will be forgiven.
    <br>How many of us will want God to help us the same way we are helping others?
    <br>Don't forget, our forgiveness does not forget.
    <br>So, you are going home now.
    <br>You say, "Oluranlowo (Helper). You are the Helper".
    <br>Is that the song I listened to now?
    <br>It is just now that I listened to that song, I said, "Eh hen".
    <br>Is that what you are saying? Ok, let me come this way to you.
    <br>Help me to sing it again.
    <br>Oluranlowo
    <br>Helper
    <br>You are my Helper
    <br>Oluranlowo mi
    <br>My Helper
    <br>You are my Helper
    <br>My Helper oh
    <br>Oh God You are
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our Christian life is as simple as that.
    <br>The way I help - the way I will be helped.
    <br>The way I forgive - the way I will be forgiven.
    <br>The way I care - the way I will be cared for.
    <br>So ask yourself, what is wrong with you.
    <br>You are saved to save others; you are helped to help others.
    <br>How many people have you helped and how do you help them - the manner you help them?
    <br>When you look at the Book of Matthew 25:40, what does it say?
    <br>It says: Whatever you do to the least of your fellow men, that you do to Him.
    <br>Whatever you give to the least, whatever you give to your neighbour, that you give to God.
    <br>How do you restore your neighbour?
    <br>How do you help your neighbour?
    <br>How do you forgive your neighbour?
    <br>How do you care for your neighbour?
    <br>You give those things you do not need.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>The only way to maintain your blessing is: Forgive and you will be forgiven.
    <br>Bless and you will be blessed.
    <br>Care and you will be cared for.
    <br>Help and you will be helped.
    <br>That is the only way. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Help - you will be helped.
    <br>Forgive - you will be forgiven.
    <br>Care - you will be cared for.
    <br>Love - you will be loved".
    <br>That is the way back home. It should be your lifestyle.
    <br>It should be your Christian life.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>What else again? You are blessed already.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Open your heart and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>He has done it for you.
    <br>Whatever spirit operating around - be exposed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All spirits operating - come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Operating in your head - you know a spirit can be operating in your head.
    <br>They are familiar spirit.
    <br>Operating in your tongue will make you to be telling lies.
    <br>You would just be lying.
    <br>After you finished lying, you say, "I don't know what is pushing me".
    <br>Operating in your eyes - you would just be looking for a beautiful dress here.
    <br>"When I leave here today, this is the kind of dress I want; let me record it."
    <br>And this handset we have now, you can hold it like this and record it.
    <br>Operating in your eyes, in your ears - 
    <br>out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to condemn that weakness - come out!
    <br>Condemn that weakness!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>You must leave here without familiar spirit.
    <br>You devil, I command you to remove your hand from my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Remove your hand from my people -
    <br>your hand of affliction, your hand of failure,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to remove his hand.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Remove his hands - his hands of affliction, his hands of failure,
    <br>his hands of stagnation.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command you devil to remove your hands from my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your hands of failure - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your hands of disppointment - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your hands of stagnation - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your hands of setback - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command every hand of affliction, every hand of failure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Look at yourself. Those hands have been removed.
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>Hands of nightmare, stagnation, failure, setback - remove it!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Indeed, the hand of evil spirit is being removed from the affairs of people's lives
    <br>and you can see what is happening to them
    <br>as the Spirit of God is moving mightily right now in the midst of the people.
    <br>The atmosphere is saturated with the power of God
    <br>to remove the hand of evil spirit in the affairs of the people
    <br>and you can see what that woman is vomiting right there,
    <br>what satan has planted in her life that is giving her pain, discomfort,
    <br>that is bringing shame and sorrow to her life.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Make sure those hands are removed.
    <br>You deserve excellence.
    <br>Say to yourself, "As a Christian, I deserve excellence".
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Devil hands - hands of affliction,
    <br>devil hands - hands of failure,
    <br>devil hands - hands of setback,
    <br>hands of failure - come out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Blood & Poisonus Substances
    <br>Watch your screen. See what has been vomited right there.
    <br>This is liver.
    <br>What has happened to him is liver.
    <br>You can see some substance on the floor.
    <br>This is liver, that has been damaged.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>More is coming.
    <br>There is a stone too that will come out with this poison -
    <br>very white stone inside your stomach.
    <br>If the stone is still remaining there, it will continue to damage more.
    <br>Every damaged organ - begin to function!
    <br>Be it your liver - begin to function!
    <br>Be it your kidneys, liver, lungs - begin to function!
    <br>Be it your heart, blood, fluids, tissue - begin to function!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>We can see another woman right there vomiting out
    <br>as we continue to pray that every damaged organ in our system should begin to function.
    <br>As we are offering that prayer, open your eyes and see what is happening all around you.
    <br>Open your lips
    <br>Begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that disease to leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That disease in your blood, fluids, liver, kidneys - out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your heart and receive and get out of this affliction.
    <br>Different poisonous substances that people are vomiting out.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>You can see another man vomiting out there, a strange substance. 
    <br>You can see that lady on the left side of the screen.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>A redish substance is coming out from her system.
    <br>What satan has planted in them is what the Spirit of God is flushing out right now.
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every pain, every affliction - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Wave your hand and give thanks to God.
    <br>Lord Jesus, don't let this deliverance pass me away.
    <br>Ask God to break the chain - chain of suffering.
    <br>Break the chain, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Chain of affliction - break the chain, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Chain of setback,
    <br>chain of stagnation - break the chain!
    <br>Open your lips.
