  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>When I was coming, I saw our children.
    <br>They were rejoicing.
    <br>I asked them, "What is happening here?"
    <br>They said, "Today is Children's Day!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We want to salute you, children; we so much believe you are the leaders of tomorrow.
    <br>We salute you!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I was looking round when you people were dancing.
    <br>I saw many people (dancing), whilst others were not.
    <br>You have to rejoice with those who are rejoicing.
    <br>The Bible says, if you fail to rejoice with those who rejoice, your day of rejoicing may be delayed.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Bible says, if you fail to rejoice with those who rejoice, your day of rejoicing may be delayed.
    <br>If you fail to rejoice with those who are rejoicing, your day of rejoicing may delay.
    <br>I will not say more than that.
    <br>So this is why you see me - when I just see people dancing, I actually join them.
    <br>I'm not pretending; I really mean it.
    <br>If you are dancing now, I will join you.
    <br>So please, you have to do so.
    <br>Sometimes when we allow our feelings to take over us, our senses to take over us,
    <br>we begin to say, "Until it happens to me, it has not happened!"
    <br>"Until I feel it, until it happens to me, it has not happened!"
    <br>Those who are giving testimony - "Oh yes, they are healed!
    <br>But I have my own here - until I am healed!"
    <br>That is the voice of senses, the voice of feelings.
    <br>"Until it happens to me, it has not happened!"
    <br>Don't allow that; you are a child of God and you know what faith is.
    <br>You need to know His faithfulness and trustworthiness.
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>For there's no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>Than to trust and obey
    <br>So you are the one singing this.
    <br>That is the song; it is a common song.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have to.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>You have seen God is reliable and the moment you see this happen, it causes your faith to grow.
    <br>It will spontaneously, side-by-side, grow.
    <br>That is your faith - you know, faith is natural.
    <br>With what you have seen today, the testimonies of others are meant to build your faith.
    <br>It is not just to, "Eh, eh..."
    <br>It is to build your faith.
    <br>Don't let unnecessary anxiety - being anxious for now and the future - to take over you.
    <br>These are the tools satan uses to trap us.
    <br>If satan does not want you to be here and you are here, he has a way of doing it.
    <br>It will take over your thoughts, your heart.
    <br>You will begin to say, "Ah, when will this happen to me?
    <br>When will I get healed? When will T.B. Joshua touch me?
    <br>I don't know. I have been to many places".
    <br>Whilst you are sitting down watching, your thoughts will be taken over by all this.
    <br>Anxious!
    <br>"What time?"
    <br>"I'm still feeling it."
    <br>"How much does the man want to collect? Do you think this can be free?"
    <br>These are the tools satan uses to trap us, to torture us, to capture us.
    <br>You will be sitting down whilst all this will be going on in your heart.
    <br>Don't be anxious.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>"When? How?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are anxious of your now and future, God's time does not matter to you.
    <br>When you are anxious of your now and future, where the solution comes from does not matter
    <br>because of desperation.
    <br>Because of what? - Desperation.
    <br>You will not listen to what other people are saying, testimonies of others,
    <br>"No, until I give my testimony!"
    <br>That is the thought that will be going on in your heart.
    <br>"No!" - "Oh yes, it happened!" - "Until I give my testimony; until I see it!"
    <br>When people are saying, "Thank You, Jesus!",
    <br>you will be looking round, trying to see, "What happened?"
    <br>before you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>You see people standing up, "What happened?"
    <br>They want to see what happened before they can say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You have to work on your heart, the state of your heart.
    <br>If it is not at its best, you are just wasting your time
    <br>because our heart is the contact point.
    <br>What is going on in your heart now?
    <br>Are you looking at my size, my stature, the way I talk?
    <br>Are you examining my words - the content or the grammar?
    <br>A lot of things - people keep busy. Many are here; many are not here.
    <br>You can see the church - everyone on the seat.
    <br>You will be very surprised that the person you see sitting down is standing.
    <br>You can be sitting and also what? - Standing.
    <br>Because you have two natures in one person.
    <br>Yours can be sitting and your divine nature standing.
    <br>Who is sitting?
    <br>Who is looking at me?
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Right now, begin to cast your burden on God. He will care for you.
    <br>With Him, all things are possible.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Do you know God loves you?
    <br>How do you know? Can somebody stand up and tell me,
    <br>How do you know Jesus loves you and how do you know you love Jesus?
    <br>Can somebody?
    <br>Yes?
    <br>Because I receive emails: People say that wherever I face, I usually ask questions from.
    <br>Yes?
    <br>Ok, yes?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok, let's hear from you.
    <br>Because we wake up every day with the breath of life.
    <br>The issue of miracles.
    <br>You like miracles too much.
    <br>Can you see now? You wake up every day.
    <br>If you do not wake up, it does not mean Jesus does not love you.
    <br>It has to do with grace; grace allows you to wake up.
    <br>You said, "Because you wake up every day".
    <br>I said, "If you do not wake up, it does not mean Jesus does not love you".
    <br>He still loves you.
    <br>How do you know?
    <br>How do you know? You must tell us.
    <br>You wake up or you do not wake up - which is the greater love from Jesus?
    <br>You wake up is the greater love from Jesus.
    <br>Ahhh!
    <br>Can you see now?
    <br>You wake up or you do not wake up - which is the greatest love?
    <br>She said to wake up is the greatest love so she can continue her sin.
    <br>If Jesus sees that you continue this wrong thing and He calls you home, is that not a blessing?
    <br>Can't you know that this death is also a miracle?
    <br>Not all - but it is a miracle.
    <br>Death is a miracle; it is a blessing.
    <br>If the Lord realises you are a candidate of Heaven
    <br>and in a minute you may lose that Heaven, He may call you home.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you are a candidate of Heaven and in a minute you may lose that Heaven,
    <br>He will call you before that minute.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What else again?
    <br>I know Jesus loves me because of what He did on the Cross for me.
    <br>You know that?
    <br>Did you read it or your heart told you this?
    <br>How do you know this?
    <br>First, I learned it before I started acting on it and then I got to know that the Word of God is true.
    <br>No one would die for you without knowing you but He did die on the Cross to save me.
    <br>Are you preaching?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am Zelda; I am a child of God.
    <br>How do we know you are a child of God?
    <br>By my actions and by doing the Word of God.
    <br>We have not seen any action; how do we know this?
    <br>My heart.
    <br>Your heart - we can't see your heart.
    <br>Yes, we are listening.
    <br>Because God knows my heart.
    <br>How do we know what you are saying is from your heart and is not something you memorised?
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes?
    <br>Let's ask the old man.
    <br>The love of Jesus is evident in every activity we perform every day.
    <br>You cannot do anything without doing it in correspondence with His power and grace -
    <br>from breathing, seeing, walking and even talking.
    <br>We are not saying you should talk for us.
    <br>Who is Jesus to you?
    <br>How do you know Jesus loves you? How do we know that you love Jesus?
    <br>I know that I love Jesus because to a certain degree, I am living...
    <br>To a certain degree Jesus measured for you?
    <br>No.
    <br>That degree is the degree Jesus has measured that you should not go beyond that degree?
    <br>There is a certain limit...
    <br>...Jesus gave you?
    <br>No.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Jesus is an everlasting Lover.
    <br>He loves you all through and gives you the chance to keep loving Him too.
    <br>But the measure of how I know how He knows is a spiritual factor; I am a human being.
    <br>Absolutely.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are a human being?
    <br>Sure. I am not in the Spirit power with God.
    <br>But His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>So, it means, you are not a Christian.
    <br>Yes, absolutely.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Clap for baba.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We thank God you are able to tell us this.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>You are going to start from where baba said he is a human being and not a spirit.
    <br>Is that true of you?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>That you are a human being?
    <br>I am a human being.
    <br>You are not a spirit?
    <br>Sir, we are two beings.
    <br>I asked, "Are you not a spirit?"
    <br>I am a spirit, living in the flesh.
    <br>Eh hen.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>How do you live in the flesh?
    <br>I have a soul and I have flesh.
    <br>We know you have a soul; that is why you have to eat rice and beans.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We know that.
    <br>Yes?
    <br>I know Jesus loves me because He died on the Cross of Calvary for my sake
    <br>and He still prays for me.
    <br>How do you realise this?
    <br>I realise that through Scriptures.
    <br>Through Scriptures. Yes?
    <br>I know I love Him; that is why I am here.
    <br>But there is no way we can know that what you are saying is true of you.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>We know that.
    <br>I live my life for Him - reading the Scriptures day-by-day
    <br>and meditating on Him through the Word of God.
    <br>Ok. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus loves me because I have committed a lot of sins and a lot of things happened to me.
    <br>There were things that were supposed to have killed me but I'm still existing today.
    <br>If not for Jesus, I would be a dead man by now.
    <br>He loves me - that is why I'm still existing.
    <br>For you not to have died, what is the reward to Jesus?
    <br>I have to serve Him and love Him back.
    <br>I have to serve Jesus truthfully and love Him back.
    <br>You have not been doing that.
    <br>Of course, sir.
    <br>Can you see, your living seems to be in vain.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What next? Do you want to die?
    <br>No, I don't want to die now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you, my brother. Clap for him.
    <br>He says he doesn't want to die. He still promises Jesus to do better.
    <br>The Lord will give you the strength.
    <br>Ok, thank you.
    <br>I know Jesus loves me because we are told that God's love, Jesus' love, is unconditional.
    <br>So, I know that God loves me and I love Him too.
    <br>You love Him too - very frank.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You said?
    <br>I love Jesus because I know He loves me and His love is unconditional - for everybody.
    <br>I partake - I thank God I partake in God's love because I am His child.
    <br>You have to work on your forgiveness.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I said, you need to work on your forgiveness.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Because you have to forgive this man.
    <br>Okay - yes, Man of God.
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>My husband.
    <br>I will see you.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's go to the other side.
    <br>You will answer this question: By what authority are you here today?
    <br>We see you in The SCOAN; we don't know if you were led by the Spirit
    <br>or you are here to see your Chairman or loved one or your loved one carried you to church today.
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>Can you be able to tell us, by what authority are you here today?
    <br>By the special grace of God, I am here to fulfill the purpose of God
    <br>because before God created me, He knew I would be here today.
    <br>Ok. So, you know if it is Jesus, we don't lie against Jesus.
    <br>What you are saying now, I cannot dispute it.
    <br>Ok?
    <br>I'm here by God's authority to come to the Arena of Liberty.
    <br>I'm seeking for God's intervention in my life.
    <br>So God led me to this place by His authority.
    <br>If God does not intervene, what will happen?
    <br>If God did not intervene, I wouldn't be here and my life would go astray.
    <br>And if nothing happens today, what will happen?
    <br>By the fact that I am here - it means God has done something in my life.
    <br>Tell us, what has God done in your life now?
    <br>God has increased my faith by my being here
    <br>and whatever that brought me here, I can see that God is taking care of it.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Did you listen to her?
    <br>This is confession. But the belief in her heart is over to God.
    <br>You don't know what you are confessing is what you believe.
    <br>How do we know that what you are confessing is what you believe?
    <br>It wouldn't be visible but if I say it in confidence because it is coming from my heart,
    <br>and my actions change according to what I say,
    <br>then people will know that what I was saying was truthful.
    <br>But people listen to your voice.
    <br>It is difficult for them to be able to know who is talking and by what authority.
    <br>The confidence in me - I am directed and led by God.
    <br>Thank you. Any other?
    <br>I think I am here because of God's plan.
    <br>I believe that each and every plan we have is not our plan; it is God's plan.
    <br>God knows best.
    <br>I tried before; I didn't manage to come.
    <br>I think because it wasn't God's time.
    <br>It wasn't God's time.
    <br>This is God's time now?
    <br>It is God's time.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Viewers, you are there and we are here. We just want to awaken your spirit.
