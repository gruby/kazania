  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, I know that you are here.
    <br>But you still want me to look at you, you alone.
    <br>I'm talking to you, listen to me.
    <br>Carry Heaven along.
    <br>Wherever you are, Heaven knows that you are there.
    <br>Heaven.
    <br>Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done.
    <br>When you carry Heaven along, you do the will of the Father.
    <br>I pray for enablement, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Jesus knows what you are talking about.
    <br>You are talking about your weakness.
    <br>You are talking about your challenges.
    <br>You are talking about your situation.
    <br>Jesus knows what you are talking about.
    <br>That challenge does not mean that you are not a Christian.
    <br>That you have challenges does not mean that you are not a Christian.
    <br>Don't measure your Christian life by your challenges.
    <br>This is the situation with you.
    <br>Your heart, your spirit testifies
    <br>that you are a Christian.
    <br>The challenges you have are meant to promote you.
    <br>The challenges that you have 
    <br>are meant for your spiritual benefit.
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Through that challenge, I can see the next promotion.
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>Desire to serve God!
    <br>Determination to serve God!
    <br>I can see you grow, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your challenge is meant to grow you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Don't listen to the voice of challenges.
    <br>Listen to God.
    <br>Challenges are meant to grow you in your Christian journey.
    <br>Look at what happened to Job.
    <br>Satan said to God, "Leave this man for me.
    <br>Let me give him challenges and situations".
    <br>The voice of challenges is to tell you,
    <br>"No, Jesus does not love me.
    <br>Jesus does not love me. I'm not faithful".
    <br>But no, listen to me!
    <br>I can see you growing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you growing in your business!
    <br>That sickness, be cursed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Wherever it is located in your system,
    <br>in your body, in your fluids, in your blood -
    <br>be cursed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every spirit that torments your life,
    <br>every spirit that causes you sickness and disease,
    <br>every spirit that causes you disappointment,
    <br>every spirit that causes you nightmares,
    <br>be cursed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Heaven knows that you are there.
    <br>Confess this and begin to rebuke those spirits!
    <br>Curse them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Heaven knows you are here!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
