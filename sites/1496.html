  <p>    
    <br>So, be ready for prayer.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Ok, let's pray.
    <br>We pray for the viewers; you are viewers too.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>God wants to answer our prayer but so often we ask for the wrong things.
    <br>We all know our relationship with God is founded upon God's mercy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My relationship with God is founded upon God's mercy".
    <br>God is absolutely holy.
    <br>When we want to pray, I say, "Let's pray".
    <br>"Father, heal me; Father, give me bread; Father, give me biscuit."
    <br>Are you really worthy to receive this?
    <br>Take note of that: When you get back home, let that be your lifestyle.
    <br>God is absolutely holy and our relationship with Him is founded upon God's mercy -
    <br>His mercy, His favour.
    <br>He wants to answer our prayer.
    <br>He wants to answer your prayer.
    <br>But we often ask for the wrong things.
    <br>Right now, we lift up our voice before praying.
    <br>Ask for God's mercy.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me!
    <br>Yes, "Son of David" - with all your heart, say this.
    <br>Ask for mercy any time you want to pray.
    <br>Ask God for His mercy and His favour.
    <br>Have mercy on me. Let Your mercy speak for me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me, Lord. Have mercy on me.
    <br>That should be your approach.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I was with you when the prophets were praying.
    <br>I saw the hosts of Heaven everywhere.
    <br>I'm here to complement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I'm here to complement; you should be ready right now.
    <br>If there is anyone in our midst that still has one or two complaints,
    <br>right now, we start our prayer from whatever damages in your system.
    <br>Every damaged organ in your system - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>Every damaged organ -
    <br>it can be your liver, your blood, your brain, your kidneys, your bones -
    <br>every damaged organ in your system - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I just need your heart right now, at this moment - heart to heart.
    <br>The Spirit of God can only contact your heart.
    <br>Every damaged organ in your system - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Damaged organ - ask yourself, "What could it be?"
    <br>It could be your fluids, your tissue, your tendons, your liver, your kidneys, your heart -
    <br>every damaged organ in your system - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips now and begin to say to the Lord your situation in your system.
    <br>Confess your challenges.
    <br>That challenge, that situation
    <br>in your body, your blood, your kidneys, your liver, your heart -
    <br>begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>He sent forth His Word and healed them.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>He sent forth His Word.
    <br>Every damaged organ in your system - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Open your heart, begin to speak out.
    <br>I can see something burst.
    <br>Begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Place your hand wherever that position is.
    <br>Begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Function - I decree, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Function - I decree, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All spirits operating in your life - I command them to come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All spirits - the spirits that cause you nightmare, setback, stagnation, affliction -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say, leave me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Leave me, in the name of Jesus!]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Leave me, in the name of Jesus!]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Leave me, in the name of Jesus!]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Leave me, in the name of Jesus!]
    <br>Right now, begin to remove the devil's hands from your life.
    <br>Remove the devil's hands from your business, your career!
    <br>His hands of affliction, his hands of stagnation, his hands of failure!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The devil's hands -
    <br>his hands of affliction,
    <br>his hands of failure,
    <br>his hands of stagnation -
    <br>begin to remove the devil's hands!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>His hands of affliction,
    <br>his hands of stagnation,
    <br>his hands of failure,
    <br>his hands of setback -
    <br>remove it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Remove it, command it right now!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You devil, I remove your hands from my people!
    <br>You can know if you are saved; God's Word says you can know.
    <br>Say, I can know if I'm free; God's Word says I can know.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever your position is, what matters is your heart.
    <br>Receive your freedom, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I remove the hands of devil from you!
    <br>All spirits operating in your life -

    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command deliverance on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever position you are - are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Every damaged organ in your system - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let the sick say, "I am healed".
    <br>Let the weak say, "I am strong".
    <br>Let the poor say, "I am blessed".
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Right now, pray for your righteous journey.
    <br>Ask God to make you a channel - a channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Ask God to make you a channel - a channel of faithfulness where there is unfaithfulness.
    <br>Ask God to make you a channel - a channel of light where there is darkness.
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Make me Your channel, Lord - Your channel of love,
    <br>Your channel of faithfulness,
    <br>Your channel of light,
    <br>Your channel of humility,
    <br>Your channel of obedience, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Let us pray for our country, our nation.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Open your lips: God's intervention!
    <br>God's intervention, in Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Yes, I want to be free; your freedom is my freedom.
    <br>I want to be free.
    <br>If anyone leaves here today without thorough screening, spiritual screening,
    <br>it will be so much my concern.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Ask yourself, "Am I free?"
    <br>You can know if you are free.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you free?"
    <br>You can know if you are free.
    <br>God's Word says you can know.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I am free!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I am free!]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[I am free!]
    <br>Don't forget what I said here.
    <br>If you are a child of God, you must know how much you need God.
    <br>You need Jesus to sit down and if you need Him to sit down, you must say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You need Jesus to stand up.
    <br>We do many things on our own.
    <br>But when you have a difficulty, you call Him.
    <br>That is not how to appreciate Him.
    <br>You need Him to sit down, stand up, comb your hair, dress, smile.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus!" - you have to cultivate this habit.
    <br>Say it out; say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Thank You, Jesus!]
    <br>Yes, even to greet your friend, your neighbour,
    <br>"God bless you, Emmanuel" - you should have this culture.
    <br>"God bless you, Emmanuel" - greet people for God's sake; it is not, "How are you?"
    <br>Where is "how are you?" in the Bible?
    <br>Say, "God bless you", greet your friend.
    <br>Say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Cultivate this culture.
    <br>"God bless you" and indeed, the person will be blessed.
    <br>How often do you say, "God bless you"?
    <br>Say it again, "God bless you".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[God bless you.]
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>[Emmanuel!]
    <br>That is it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This can only happen when you believe Jesus enough.
    <br>When you believe Jesus enough,
    <br>you say to your neighbour, "God bless you. Emmanuel! Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>You see that voice, you must...
    <br>What is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>This reflection - people should see.
    <br>I mean, out of the abundance of the heart.
    <br>"God bless you!"
    <br>'Emmanuel' means God is with us.
    <br>- "How are you, sir?"
    <br>- "Oh, God bless you, Emmanuel!"
    <br>Cultivate this.
    <br>Let the world know whom you are, what you stand for.
    <br>I'm redeemed. Jesus is my Redeemer!
    <br>I'm healed. Jesus is my Healer!
    <br>I'm saved. Jesus is my Saviour!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me hear again - "Emmanuel!"
    <br>[Emmanuel!]
    <br>"God bless you!"
    <br>[God bless you!]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[Emmanuel! God bless you!]
    <br>Look, let me tell you:
    <br>When you begin to say this, the devil will run away from you.
    <br>They cannot catch you unprepared.
    <br>People will even run from you.
    <br>This will definitely screen all your relationships, your friends -
    <br>those who are deceiving to be your friend, those who are a pretender,
    <br>those who have a pretentious character.
    <br>"God bless you" - they will not come to you again.
    <br>"Emmanuel" - they will not come to you again.
    <br>When you get to your working place, if your boss is not of God
    <br>and you say, "God bless you", this is the end of the relationship.
    <br>You need good people. You need inspiring people.
    <br>You need people that can help you, not just any kind of friend you have -
    <br>friends that are dividing, subtracting - you don't need them.
    <br>So "God bless you, Emmanuel" will screen them, will take them away...
    <br>Say it again, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>[Emmanuel!]
    <br>"God bless you!"
    <br>[God bless you!]
    <br>That is all!
