  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, what God is about to do in your life -
    <br>hear from the prophet:
    <br>I shall say that which I shall live to see happen!
    <br>Hear what God is about to do at this moment.
    <br>Are you ready to hear?
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>I'm not praying for you; rather I'm telling you the will of God.
    <br>You will pray; I will tell you the will of God.
    <br>I will guide you.
    <br>Because prayer has language.
    <br>If you don’t speak the language, you are saying words.
    <br>But when you speak the language, you are praying prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Prayer has language".
    <br>If you don’t speak the language, you are saying words.
    <br>But when you speak the language, you are praying prayer.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Wave you hands.
