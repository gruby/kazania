    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>As the evangelists sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua minister the Morning Water to the congregation
    <br>at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>all the demonic chains in the lives of the people are being broken.
    <br>Every chain satan might have used to connect them to himself come loose in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Watch and see how this lady and her mother were delivered in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus. Speak out, who are you?
    <br>Ministration Of The Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>You said you are who?
    <br>I am the spiritual husband.
    <br>Ok, how many of you are in this body?
    <br>Stop it! Stop spraying!
    <br>How many of you are in this body? We don't have your time.
    <br>How many of you?
    <br>Idol.
    <br>You said you are what?
    <br>Idol.
    <br>As an idol and a spiritual husband, what have you done to her?
    <br>Stop it!
    <br>As an idol, speak out - what have you done to her?
    <br>I destroyed her and I want to kill her.
    <br>Her destiny is just too bright; I want to kill her.
    <br>How do you want to kill her - explain?
    <br>Her destiny is too bright; she wants to liberate the family.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>I don't want that.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Speak! What have you done to her career?
    <br>I put the spirit of anger in her.
    <br>She is very aggressive; I did it.
    <br>Don't spray that; I don't like it.
    <br>Open you eyes. Who is this woman beside you? Open your eyes!
    <br>Who is this woman beside you?
    <br>Who is she?
    <br>Her mother.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Who is this lady?
    <br>She is my daughter.
    <br>What can you say about your daughter?
    <br>She has a bad character; she doesn't behave well.
    <br>She didn't finish school.
    <br>She gets sick and I have to rush her to the hospital.
    <br>Her father is an idol worshipper.
    <br>I rush her to the hospital every other day.
    <br>Who caused her all these setbacks?
    <br>Who is the cause?
    <br>It is me.
    <br>Right now, it is time for you to leave this body.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus - out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, Holy Ghost fire! All over your body.
    <br>From your head to your toes - Holy Ghost fire!

    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, begin to remove it!
    <br>Whatever you have put on her head, that causes her setback -
    <br>out!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen.

    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Madam, your daughter has been delivered today.
    <br>Do not remind her of what she has been delivered from today;
    <br>unless she shall be tempted.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>You demon, what have you done to her?
    <br>What have you caused this marriage?

    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>On your toes!
    <br>Speak!
    <br>I am the spirit of anger.
    <br>You are spirit of what?
    <br>Anger.
    <br>Ok. As a spirit of anger, what have you done to her?
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>What else - speak!
    <br>She always quarrels.
    <br>What else have you made her to do?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I make people hate her; they always hate her.
    <br>Open your eyes, who is this lady beside you?

    <br>Who is this woman to you?
    <br>She is my mother.
    <br>What can you say about your mom?
    <br>She used to quarrel over any little thing.
    <br>People she helps, all turn back against her; no one is asking after her.
    <br>Everybody in the family hates her.
    <br>Who is the cause of that?
    <br>Who is the cause?
    <br>Speak! Who is the cause of that?
    <br>Who is the cause?
    <br>Anger.

    <br>When she was small.
    <br>Ok. It is time for you to leave this body.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus - out!

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Irabor Patience from Edo State.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my mother.
    <br>The other one is my elder brother, a graduate of Ambrose Ali University.
    <br>The other one is my cousin.
    <br>We all came here for our deliverance.
    <br>This spiritual husband had really affected me and my career.
    <br>Can you start by telling us what you were delivered from?
    <br>I was delivered from a spiritual husband, the spirit of idol from my father's house
    <br>and from the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>This idol had really disturbed me.
    <br>We were all born into an idol family.
    <br>My father was an idol worshipper.
    <br>The thing had really disturbed us.
    <br>Ever since my dad died, the idol had been tormenting the children.
    <br>We had all become scattered and nothing was going well for us.
    <br>My brother who is a graduate, nothing was going well for him.
    <br>My sister out there was suffering.
    <br>I was also suffering.
    <br>I managed to enter school.
    <br>When I was in school, I moved with friends and went out to clubs
    <br>because the spiritual husband had really tormented me.
    <br>Was this at secondary school or university?
    <br>It was at university.
    <br>My mum was complaining that things were not working well for her.
    <br>What used to happen to you when you were in the university?
    <br>When I was in university, I was not living a good life.
    <br>This spirit had really tormented me.
    <br>Each time I was in school, the evil spirit would push me to go out with men for money -
    <br>just to get money to take care of myself and my family because of the predicament in the home.
    <br>We had been suffering.
    <br>What about other members of the family?
    <br>My sister also went out to Malaysia, just to get means for us to survive.
    <br>But still, she went there and was doing the same thing - prostitution.
    <br>It really affected us.
    <br>My sister called my mum one day and asked her if we had heard of The SCOAN,
    <br>that we should come to The SCOAN because she was tired of everything.
    <br>She said she was suffering there and didn't want to live that kind of life anymore.
    <br>That was how we came to The SCOAN and were all delivered last Sunday.
    <br>Tell us - when the Morning Water was being ministered to you, what did you feel at that moment?
    <br>When the Morning Water was ministered to me at that moment,
    <br>I felt something in me trying to come out.
    <br>I felt fire in me; something was burning inside me. I felt heat all over my body.
    <br>That was how I came out, manifested and was delivered.
    <br>Since your deliverance, can you tell us what the changes are that have taken place in your life?
    <br>Since my deliverance, I sleep well.
    <br>I don't have the urge to go out with men anymore.
    <br>I sleep well. I have good dreams.
    <br> I don't have the urge of going out to sleep with men anymore.
    <br>I am delivered now.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Apart from going out with men, what were other attitudes, behaviours and habits you developed then?
    <br>When I was in school, I used to go to clubs, drink with my friends, go to parties and go out with men.
    <br>That was not the kind of life I wanted for myself.
    <br>The spirit in me had really tormented me.
    <br>Since after your deliverance, do you still have the urge to drink alcohol?
    <br>No, I don't have the urge to take alcohol or to go out with men anymore.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Irabor Patience & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>We thank God.
    <br>Before we listen to your word of advice, let us hear from your mother who was also delivered.
    <br>Irabor Patience & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Madam, can you please tell us your name and your own side of the testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Tessy Irabor.
    <br>I'm from Edo State.
    <br>Tessy & Family
    <br>Edo, Nigeria
    <br>She is my daughter.
    <br>This is my son.
    <br>The other one is my sister's daughter.
    <br>Really, I married an idol worshipper.
    <br>The idol worshipping was fighting against us.
    <br>The spiritual husband was working against me - everything.
    <br>We didn't even know where we were going.
    <br>My daughter travelled to Malaysia for prostitution.
    <br>This son of mine who graduated - no work.
    <br>This one was doing her own thing.
    <br>When my daughter called me, she asked me if I knew The SCOAN. I said, "Yes".
    <br>She said that there was a problem.
    <br>I told her my own was a problem -
    <br>that my market had gone down and that I couldn't even see anything to eat in the house.
    <br>Then, my daughter told me that I should be ready to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I told her I didn't have the transport fare.
    <br>She made a face and brought out money.
    <br>When she brought the money, I struggled to collect the money from her to give people I owed.
    <br>My daughter insisted we come to the SCOAN.
    <br>That was how we came for deliverance.
    <br>I thank God that my children are delivered and I am delivered, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Tessy & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Tell us - since after your deliverance, how has your life and everything else been?
    <br>Since my deliverance, I sleep well and I am very happy.
    <br>I told my son and my daughter that I sleep very well now.
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>What word of advice do you have for people who are listening to your testimony?
    <br>The advice I want to give people concerning this kind of problem I entered
    <br>with an idol worshipper is that before you give your daughter to any man,
    <br>watch the house and check whether there are any idols there.
    <br>If an idol is there, pray, so that God would deliver you.
    <br>Tessy & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Ok.
    <br>So that is the advice that we should watch out before we jump!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for everything.
    <br>Now the family is delivered to the glory of God.
    <br>We would like to hear from our brother as well.
    <br>Irabor Patience & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Irabor Frank.
    <br>We are from Edo State.
    <br>This is my mother, my younger sister and my little cousin.
    <br>I thank God that my family is delivered from idol worship.
    <br>I really noticed it in my mum because in those days, if I told her a little thing,
    <br>she would get annoyed.
    <br>After her deliverance on Sunday, we got home. We were just talking.
    <br>There was a word I was using but she didn't even pick on me; she just talked and smiled.
    <br>I said, "Wow! Thank God, we are really delivered!"
    <br>Emmanuel! My family is delivered!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Tell us how this idol affected your own life personally.
    <br>What are the challenges you have been facing?
    <br>It had really affected me.
    <br>When I graduated during my NYSC,
    <br>I met some people who said they were going to help me after my NYSC.
    <br>But immediately I finished my NYSC, I misplaced my phone and I didn't see them again.
    <br>The last one I met said that he would see what he could do but up to now - nothing.
    <br>So you mean since you graduated, there's nothing to show for it?
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>Now the family is delivered, your past is over and your breakthrough is restored.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let us clap for Jesus!
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Finally, can we hear a word of advice from you
    <br>to young ones like yourself and also to parents?
    <br>My advice to my fellow youth is that we should not look at other people on the outside.
    <br>I am dressed like this - seeing me dressed like this, you would feel that I had it all.
    <br>No, I did not have it all; I was burning inside because I could not stop it.
    <br>I thank God that I am delivered.
    <br>If you have the same problem as I had, the only thing I will tell you is for you to run to Christ
    <br>because He is the only One who can save us.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Irabor Patience & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Indeed, only Jesus Christ can save.
    <br>He is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>Now that you and the entire family are delivered, we want to encourage you
    <br>to stay true to our Lord Jesus Christ, make the Word of God the standard for your life and your family
    <br>and embrace the wonderful Word of God as the most effective instrument for change.
    <br>As you do so, the breakthrough and blessings of God Almighty will begin to unfold
    <br>and you will come back to testify to this, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
