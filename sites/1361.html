    <br>Let somebody say: "Thank you, Jesus!"
    <br>Indeed, a million thanks are not enough to express our gratitude to God
    <br>for what you have been seeing from the beginning of the service.
    <br>Let somebody say: "The Lord is here". Let somebody say: "The Healer is in our midst."
    <br>Let somebody say: "The living God is in our midst."
    <br>The Creator of Heaven and earth is in our midst through his Word and by his Spirit
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Say: "Lord Jesus, I thank you for every moment of Your attention".
    <br>Say: "Lord, we don't know how to satisfy the needs of our lives
    <br>but Lord, You do -  that's why I'm here."
    <br>Say: "Lord, that's why I'm here."
    <br>Give thanks to God for His mercy and for His grace.
    <br>You maybe seated in His presence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Am I talking to believers?
    <br>I hear only two.
    <br>Am I talking to believers in Christ?
    <br>If I am talking to a genuine believer, a smile should enlighten your face
    <br>because you know it has been done already.
    <br>Yes, brethren.
    <br>Christianity is not a religion but a living relationship with a living God.
    <br>Just because a person calls himself a Christian does not mean he is a believer.
    <br>A man of sense-knowledge belief may mentally assent and never have;
    <br>he may hope and never have.
    <br>He may be familiar with the original text of the of the Scriptures in Greek and Hebrew,
    <br>he may know the history of the Word and still never have.
    <br>Let someone say:
    <br>It is not our logic, our philosophy, our knowledge that brings about a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Men may mentally assent and not have.
    <br>Men may do much by outward restraint but lack the character of God in their resolutions.
    <br>That's why the Bible says in the Book of Matthew 7:20
    <br>By their fruit you shall know them.
    <br>Jesus Christ never strived to look good; He was simply good.
    <br>Jesus Christ never strived to have a good reputation; He had character from above.
    <br>A man can be a Christian by profession, by confession and not such in heart.
    <br>Human knowledge, human understanding oftentimes makes a mistaken judgement
    <br>of character but the Lord only values the holy faith, love, peace -  the fruit of the spirit -
    <br>embedded in your heart, beyond human discernment
    <br>This leads us to the title of our message:
    <br>CHRISTIANITY IS ALL ABOUT HEART
    <br>Let's somebody say: "True Christianity is all about heart."
    <br>Let me take you to the book of Matthew 15:8
    <br>It says,
    <br>"These people draw near to Me with their mouth and honour me with their lips,
    <br>but their heart is far from me..."
    <br>Verse 9:
    <br>"And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."
    <br>Let somebody say: "It's all about heart."
    <br>The Book of Proverbs 27:19 says that
    <br>our life reflects what is in our hearts.
    <br>This means the heart refers to the man himself.
    <br>The Prophet T.B. Joshua says
    <br>it is the seat of desires, emotions, knowledge, conscience and moral character.
    <br>Let somebody say: "Living is all about heart."
    <br>2 Corinthians 5.
    <br>The mind of God says that if anyone is in Christ Jesus, he is a new creation.
    <br>The old man has ceased to be; the new man has taken place.
    <br>This means your past is over. Say: "My past is over."
    <br>When your past is over, it means you are born anew.
    <br>It means you are sanctified by the truth of Christ.
    <br>When you give the control of your life to Jesus, the Lord will give you a new heart,
    <br>He will give you a new nature and new desire to please Him.
    <br>Say: "Neighbour,
    <br>when you give the control of your life to God, He will give you a new heart,
    <br>a new desire to please Him."
    <br>Accepting Jesus Christ is to accept the nature of God.
    <br>How do we have the nature of God? It is God's Word that builds the nature of God into us.
    <br>In other words,
    <br>Christ is building Himself into us, as His Word rules, dominates and sanctifies our spirit nature.
    <br>Let somebody say:
    <br>"God's Word is spirit and life."
    <br>Whatever my heart engages on, influences my conduct and my character.
    <br>The Holy Spirit uses God's Word to act upon our soul to produce the virtues of Christ's character.
    <br>God's Word can only enlighten you and me, it can only quicken us
    <br>when it is illumined by the Spirit of God.
    <br>God's Word reflects His character.
    <br>When the Word of God dominates our mouth, it will dominate our heart.
    <br>When the Word of God dominates our heart, it will influence our behaviour, our character, our attitude.
    <br>Let someone say:
    <br>"The Word of God - the living Word -
    <br>the Word of God is the living presence of the divine power.
    <br>It is God's power working through His Word and by His Spirit that brings about a new life.
    <br>I am here for a change. My life will change. My attitude will change. My past is over.
    <br>The evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.
    <br>Today, if you believe, no matter your past,
    <br>Jesus has come to put an end to your past and give birth to your future.
    <br>The Gospel of God's grace challenges and changes everything.
    <br>We have seen a sinner's character being healed.
    <br>We have seen a liar becoming truthful.
    <br>We have seen a drunkard becoming sober.
    <br>To His power nothing is impossible.
    <br>Saul grew up under the feet of Gameliel. He knew all the rights of the law of Moses.
    <br>But the Bible says he was serving a God he did not know.
    <br>Because we can't God by outward things.
    <br>He was persecuting those who believed in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Because he was living outside the truth, where the true light comes from.
    <br>Saul simply needed to know God better.
    <br>Say: "Neighbour,
    <br>you need to know God better. No matter your problem, focus on God.
    <br>You need to know God better." Just an encounter with the Lord and your life will change today.
    <br>After his encounter with Jesus,
    <br>Saul's sense-knowledge belief gave way to a new kind of knowledge.
    <br>It is a spiritual knowledge, revelation knowledge.
    <br>The Bible says that
    <br>immediately Saul discovered the man God wanted him to be, the great Apostle Paul.
    <br>Jesus Christ never disconnects Himself from anyone who makes mistakes in their life.
    <br>No matter what brought you here today, no matter the mistakes you have committed -
    <br>there is hope for you.
    <br>I say, there is hope for you.
    <br>Jesus never rejected anyone who came to Him for healing, deliverance, salvation.
    <br>There was a woman of bad character.
    <br>The Bible says she was a sinful woman.
    <br>But she met Jesus in the house of Simon, the Pharisee.
    <br>Jesus met her in the condition where she was rejected because of the sinful life she was living.
    <br>But immediately she knew about Jesus, the Bible says, she became conscious of her sins
    <br>and she ran to Jesus ready to restore and make peace with her Creator, Jesus Christ the Lord.
    <br>She came to Jesus behind, crying and Jesus saw in her an attitude of remorse, humility,
    <br>self-denial and a desire to change.
    <br>And the Lord was moved to compassion, brushed aside her unworthy past
    <br>and her life of prostitution came to an end.
    <br>She became a woman of noble character.
    <br>I want you to talk to your neighbour, say: "Neighbour,
    <br>I don't know what you are going through,
    <br>I don't know where you are coming from,
    <br>I don't know what your challenge is
    <br>but all I know, we are are serving a God who never dodges crisis.
    <br>He sees them as a challenge.
    <br>If you put your problem into the hand of Jesus today, He will put his peace in your heart.
    <br>Say neighbour: "Are you such in heart?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour: "Are you such in heart?"
    <br>Man of God says:
    <br>"The principal source of finding ourselves spiritually, the principal source of knowing ourselves saved
    <br>is the Holy Bible; there is no substitute to it.
    <br>The Word of God is the seed of divine life that comes into our heart and causes faith to grow.
    <br>And faith purifies the heart and sanctifies it from all those lusts of the world.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Say: "Neighbour, are you ready?
    <br>For the radical transformation
    <br>that only God can bring?
    <br>Today, many confess the name of Jesus Christ and deny Him in action.
    <br>Many confess the name of the Lord and deny Him by their attitude.
    <br>Their attitude does not reflect what they believe. What is the cause of this? 
    <br>Only our character can testify to our confession of Jesus.
    <br>Jesus Christ has no place in the heart not dominated by His Word.
    <br>The word has priority over His name.
    <br>We must be grounded, rooted in the Word of God before we call that name,
    <br>before we bring Jesus on the scene.
    <br>Failure to give Jesus Christ His proper position in our hearts is actually responsible
    <br>for the crisis of our faith today.
    <br>Let someone say:
    <br>"Failure to give Jesus His proper position in our heart is actually responsible
    <br>for the crisis of our faith.
    <br>In other words, failure to allow the Word of God in the midst of our hearts
    <br>is actually responsible for the crisis of our faith.
    <br>Brethren, I put to you finally.
    <br>In Christ Jesus there is a general offer of life and salvation to all who believe.
    <br>When you accept Jesus Christ genuinely,
    <br>you have the very presence of God in your heart through the Holy Spirit.
    <br>And the man of God says
    <br>the Holy Spirit is God's imperative of life. He is a Giver  of all life.
    <br>He renews and changes our lives.
    <br>The basic work of the Spirit of God in our life in salvation is to impart a new life
    <br>into the heart of the believer.
    <br>Thus making me and you a child of God, a true believer in Christ.
    <br>I want you to stand up in His presence. Say:
    <br>"Lord Jesus, I am here for a change.
    <br>I am here, Lord, for the radical transformation of my life that only You can bring.
    <br>Lord, here I am. I believe; help me overcome my unbelief.
    <br>Here I am.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ."
    <br>Brethren,
    <br>the moment you make Jesus the CEO, the Director of your life,
    <br>you will be wired to the creator in a unique way.
    <br>You will fear no more; you will worry no more.
    <br>I am reconciled; I am linked up with God.
    <br>Brethren,
    <br>to be born again is to have a new life.
    <br>Repentance is our only hope for God's mercy.
    <br>It is a commitment to a new way of life.
    <br>It is a commitment to a new way of righteousness of following God in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>When you follow Jesus today, your life will change, your attitude will change
    <br>and you will become saved and delivered in Jesus' name.
    <br>May the Word of God bless your heart in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus.
