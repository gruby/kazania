    <br>SHOCKING: What Happened After I Slept With A Prostitute!!!
    <br>This young man came to The SCOAN from Kaduna in northern Nigeria with a problem of permanent erection,
    <br>diagnosed in his medical report from the Lagos State Government Hospital as priapism.
    <br>Mister Victor Kachiro, although just 24 years of age, has been suffering with this problem for several months.
    <br>He stands still raising his t-shirt, then turns slowly to his left-hand side to show the obvious bulge in his trousers.
    <br>Gently sliding his baggy trousers down, the painful permanent erection is clear to see.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and healing under the control of the Spirit of God
    <br>to people with various afflictions, in need of divine mercy.
    <br>Please, help my son, man of God!
    <br>He met a prostitute and has been having a permanent erection.
    <br>Please, man of God, help my son.
    <br>Help my son, nam of God!
    <br>In the Name of Jesus Christ, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Victor Kachiro
    <br>and the cause of the problem of permanent erection is destroyed by the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>He falls to the floor under the Spirit of God's delivering influence, declared free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>He rises to his feet to thank Jesus Christ - his healer.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, my son is free!
    <br>Some time later, Mr Victor Kachiro returned to The SCOAN to testify of what the Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>has done in his life after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Let's watch!
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>As you can see now, I am healed.
    <br>I can touch it; I can feel it.
    <br>I don’t feel any pain anymore.
    <br>I couldn’t do this before but now, I can do it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The erection is gone; everything is gone.
    <br>I am healed – totally healed!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Victor Kachiro
    <br>The woman standing next to me is my mum - her name is Rebeca Kachiro.
    <br>This is my dad - mister Kachiro.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN  was a permanent erection.
    <br>I had been suffering from this problem since December, 2016 when I went out with my friends.
    <br>We did all sorts of bad things.
    <br>That was what led to the permanent erection.
    <br>This is how it all started: my friends and I would go out and take all sorts of things,
    <br>like drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.
    <br>Then, we would look for prostitute and sleep with them.
    <br>The next day after sleeping with a prostitute, I discovered that my penis was erect
    <br>and was unable to go down; I was in so much pain.
    <br>After that...
    <br>So, just to be clear brother - immediately after you met with this prostitute, under the influence of alcohol,
    <br>smoking, the following morning your erection was permanent and it refused to go down
    <br>and was extremely painful.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Then, I was taken to hospital where the doctor told me that I had to be operated on.
    <br>After the doctor told me that I was to be operated...
    <br>At that time, I was in pain and had no choice.
    <br>I laid on the bed waiting for them to carry out their procedures.
    <br>When my mum came, I told her what the doctor had said.
    <br>My mum said no, that I couldn’t be operated on as she had faith that God could do it for me.
    <br>I'm sorry brother; when the doctors booked you for an operation, what did they say would happen to you
    <br>after the operation, as a consequence of doing that operation?
    <br>They said that I might become impotent.
    <br>So, the doctors told you that there was a high risk of you becoming impotent, as a result of this operation,
    <br>but because of the pain you were going through, you agreed to it and you were booked for the operation,
    <br>when your mum came and met you at the hospital?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, after that...
    <br>They even convinced me that I had the right to decide on my own whether or not to be operated on.
    <br>I then told them that since my mum was there, I would go with what she advised.
    <br>I would go anywhere my mum took me to.
    <br>That day, they even wrote notes about us with a red pen instead of a blue one -
    <br>because they were angry – I don’t know why.
    <br>We went home and the next day, we came to Lagos.
    <br>On the 20th of December, we came to The SCOAN.
    <br>We want to understand; when you came to The SCOAN, you were in this very critical situation, in a lot of pain,
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>Can you describe to us what happened when he prayed for you?
    <br>When he prayed for me, I felt so happy and I am relieved.
    <br>Everything in normal.
    <br>I feel like a newborn baby.
    <br>OK.
    <br>So, we saw when he prayed for you, you actually fell to the ground.
    <br>Can you describe what was happening in your body at that moment?
    <br>When he laid his hand on me, firstly, it felt like there was a flash of light on my eyes,
    <br>after which, I fell on the ground.
    <br>While on the ground, I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>I regained full consciousness and found that everything was back to normal!
    <br>- Praise the Lord!
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, you mean to say brother that at that moment the severe, intense pain left and you were relieved?
    <br>And tell us what happened after the prayer.
    <br>After the prayer and regaining full consciousness, I felt normal.
    <br>I went back home and everything was back to normal.
    <br>I no longer did the things I used to do.
    <br>I returned fully to my normal self.
    <br>You mean to say that the pain left and then you realised that the erection started reducing
    <br>and finally it returned completely to normal, just a few days after that touch from Jesus Christ?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Brother, it has been several months since then; just tell us - does it mean that for this whole period
    <br>you have been living a normal life, freely, without having that pain or permanent erection?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Everything is...
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>To the glory of God; can you just show us, touch the area, so we can see for ourselves the fact
    <br>that everything is normal now?
    <br>You can see it here.
    <br>Everything is back to normal.
    <br>I can jump and bend down now.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can see people laughing but obviously, if you were in his position, you would understand the amount of pain
    <br>he suffered when he was injured,
    <br>even to the extent that doctors actually booked him for an operation because of that situation.
    <br>To the glory of God - he is completely free now.
    <br>Brother, what do you want to advise viewers around the world, especially young people,
    <br>since you acknowledged that it was as a result of influence of bad friends, going out to meet prostitutes,
    <br>smoking and drinking, that led you to this predicament?
    <br>What is your advice to the young people?
    <br>The advice that I want to give to young people is to stay away from bad friends and prostitutes
    <br>because they will make your life miserable.
    <br>Always keep good friends, who will lead you to the right way,
    <br>not bad friends who will lead you to the wrong way
    <br>because they will not help you in your future; they cannot help matters.
    <br>Always follow the Scripture and keep it in your heart.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is an advice born of life experience.
    <br>We believe that our brothers and sisters around the world are listening what our brother has to say.
    <br>Let's quickly hear a word from your mum.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Children of God; Emmanuel!
    <br>I am Mrs Rebecca Kachiro.
    <br>I am from Kaduna State.
    <br>That is my lovely husband there,
    <br>and this is my son.
    <br>I am a mother of six - this is my fourth born.
    <br>It all happened...
    <br>He lives quite a distance away from us.
    <br>I had received a phone call that he was sick.
    <br>It was as if they were trying to hide it from me; they didn’t want me to know the actual problem.
    <br>Because of the pain he was in, he had agreed to be operated upon.
    <br>To God be the glory, it was a divine arrangement.
    <br>He was supposed to be taken to theatre that fateful day at 9am.
    <br>But I left Kaduna at 10:30am.
    <br>They did not take him to theatre before I arrived.
    <br>When I arrived, I told them that no, this boy would not be operated on.
    <br>They asked me why and I replied that my faith was not in the hospital.
    <br>To God be the glory, I overheard the doctors discussing among themselves
    <br>that they would operate on him and everything would go well
    <br>but that there was the risk that he would become impotent.
    <br>I then told my husband what the doctors had said.
    <br>He asked, "Since the boy is in pain, what do we do?"
    <br>I said no, that God would do something.
    <br>I pleaded; they took me to the general manager of the hospital to convince me
    <br>that my boy should undergo the operation.
    <br>I told them that my faith was not in the hospital,
    <br>that they should allow me to take the boy to church.
    <br>So, that was how in the end, God won the battle for me.
    <br>They took him to theatre to force him to be operated on.
    <br>I saw him coming out saying, "Madam, since you..."...
    <br>They gave me a document and asked me to sign it.
    <br>I insisted on reading the wording before I signed it.
    <br>It stated that I would take full responsibility in the event that anything happened to him.
    <br>I told them that I would come back to that hospital with a testimony.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for our mother's faith.
    <br>She realised that this problem was not just a natural problem but a spiritual one.
    <br>We all know that doctors treat but Jesus Christ cures.
    <br>Doctors are playing a wonderful role in helping many people but our mother realised that the case of her son
    <br>was not a natural situation but a spiritual situation, that required divine intervention.
    <br>Madam, when you brought your son to The SCOAN and he received prayer;
    <br>can you just tell us what happened and what are the changes that you saw in his life thereafter?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>When we came to The SCOAN, my son was placed at the prayer line.
    <br>During the prayer, he fainted and I knew that something had happened.
    <br>On reaching home, after six days, everything became normal.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give all the glory to God.
    <br>Madam, in the lights of what God has done for your son, what is your own word of advice for our viewers?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Parents, I want you to take note of your children.
    <br>Observe their movements; observe the type of friends they keep.
    <br>You may not follow them everywhere they go but you can render prayers.
    <br>I took a bold step believing that I have a God who would answer and deliver him.
    <br>Inside me, I felt that the operation was not going to be successful.
    <br>So, I want to address mothers especially.
    <br>Mothers, say "Praise the Lord!"
    <br>Mothers have a lot to do.
    <br>Men are often too busy.
    <br>As a mother, it is your duty to do good work.
    <br>Your husband is just like a baby in your hands - I always say this.
    <br>Especially your children, they are little babies, no matter how they have grown.
    <br>You have to decide for them in some issues, especially in terms of spiritual battle.
    <br>So, I believe that if we follow these tips, God will see us through, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally, let's hear a word from the father of the young man as well.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome.
    <br>Please, introduce yourself to us and tell us what can you say about this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Anthony Dennis Kachiro.
    <br>We are all from Kaduna State.
    <br>He is Victor Kachiro, my fourth son,
    <br>and this is my darling; wife Rebecca Kachiro.
    <br>The devil wanted to enter the family but with the faith that my wife had, we were able to succeed.
    <br>It was one morning, when I was preparing to go to work for an assignment
    <br>that I received a phone call that my son had been taken to the general hospital.
    <br>I tried to ask them what the matter was because I hadn't had any reported case of ill health.
    <br>Then, the person who tried to tell me said that it was something very strange.
    <br>I became so confused and told my wife to rush to the hospital.
    <br>She went after analysing and seeing everything and then called me on the phone,
    <br>and told me that they were talking about an operation.
    <br>I reminded her that she had told me he was in serious pain
    <br>and asked her what she wanted us to do, that why couldn't she just allow them to operate
    <br>but she insisted that he had to be taken for prayers in The SCOAN.
    <br>So, I accepted.
    <br>I have to thank God for making this possible.
    <br>She came and we made arrangements.
    <br>That is exactly what has happened.
    <br>I want to say that she has encouraged me and encouraged the family
    <br>because we were all confused at that stage.
    <br>So, once again, we can understand how critical the situation was.
    <br>Glory be to God that your son came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Sir, what can you say about the transformation in his life through the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>There was a transformation, not only concerning the sickness
    <br>but also concerning some of the issues we were confronting.
    <br>As soon as he was prayed for, when he received his healing,
    <br>he became strong and everything was so much in order.
    <br>There were some things that some of his brothers could not do that he, wholeheartedly,
    <br>had engaged himself in doing – all those things that we had been missing from a son.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>So, you mean to say he was completely restored, the permanent erection went after the prayer,
    <br>he has now been living a normal life for several months?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Exactly, glory be to God.
    <br>Finally sir, what is your own word of advice?
    <br>I want to advise all youth that they should always try to follow things gradually.
    <br>Going into these vices of smoking, drinking and doing what they are not supposed to do will not help them.
    <br>Rather, they are to hold fast to their studies so they would be able to achieve and build a family.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
