  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated, thank you!
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- (Amen.)
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us, Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The message that I have for you today is 
    <br>'The burden in our spirit'.
    <br>That is; when one is thinking, worried and troubled
    <br>your spirit cannot be free to attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>We cannot be available for God when we are worried.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When you are worried, troubled - 
    <br>maybe something is troubling or worrying you,
    <br>you cannot be available for God's Spirit.
    <br>Our spirits are free when we are free.
    <br>This is why in 1 Peter 5:7, when you start reading from verse 7,
    <br>it says, "Your cares, your troubles - to God because He cares for you and He loves you."
    <br>When we are troubled, we cannot be sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>You need a free spirit to pray.
    <br>You need a free spirit to hear from God.
    <br>You need a free spirit to do what?
    <br>To hear from God.
    <br>You cannot hear from God when your spirit is troubled.
    <br>He is the Landlord; He cannot share that apartment with anyone.
    <br>When you say someone is the landlord of a house; you pay house rent to the man.
    <br>He cannot share...,
    <br>He is the landlord, the owner; He doesn't want to share anything.
    <br>He created you - spirit, soul and body.
    <br>Without this free spirit, you cannot 
    <br>act upon the Word of God.
    <br>You only hear the Word; you cannot do anything about it.
    <br>You will only hear, "Jesus is Lord! Jesus is Saviour! Jesus is this, Jesus is that..."
    <br>As you hear, it goes this way, when you are troubled.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to the degree you stand in reverence,
    <br>in obeying and in honour of His Word.
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released.
    <br>As you honour the Word, the Spirit increases.
    <br>It's like you are being filled.
    <br>You know, as you eat food you get filled.
    <br>The more you eat you get filled...
    <br>You need a free spirit to get along, to act with God.
    <br>Without a free spirit , there is nothing, nothing and nothing...
    <br>So therefore...
    <br>Leave it for God; don't worry yourself.
    <br>- Leave it for what?
    <br>- (God.)
    <br>Open 1 Peter chapter 5.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Chapter 5 verse 7.
    <br>"Give all your worries and cares to God for He cares about you."
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>Give all your what?
    <br>All your worries and cares; cares mean trouble, burden - whatever you call it, it is a foolish thing.
    <br>... for He cares for you.
    <br>This is why when you want to open you Bible to read, its time to give all your what?
    <br>Troubles.
    <br>Give all your cares and troubles to God.
    <br>That is, leave all - whatever is bothering you, worrying you.
    <br>When you don't; you will read and you will not able to obey what you read.
    <br>You will read the Bible as if you are reading literature, a book.
    <br>You know when you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit
    <br>but any other book outside Bible, when you are reading them, you are reading about event.
    <br>Some will say, "Is that actually possible to give all worries? How will one just overlook his trouble?
    <br>Is it actually possible?"
    <br>Yes! That is actually why God gave you discretion.
    <br>You can choose to cry, you can choose to laugh.
    <br>You can choose to dance, you can choose not to.
    <br>You can choose to leave here, walk out of this place and you can choose to sit.
    <br>You can choose to stand...
    <br>This is why Jesus met this man at the pool of Bethesda.
    <br>He said, "What can I do for you?"
    <br>He knew the problem the man was facing.
    <br>He was so sick that he could not jump into the pool.
    <br>He needed someone to help him to jump into the pool.
    <br>But Jesus knew his problem but he said still, "What can I do for you?"
    <br>He knew that he might have refused him.
    <br>He knew he might have disagreed with Him.
    <br>He knew that he might have made Him walk away.
    <br>"- What can I do for you?
    <br>- Yes, I needed someone to carry me to the pool.
    <br>... each time the water is stirred - that is turning.
    <br>But here I am, so sick, no one to carry me to the pool.
    <br>- Can I help?"
    <br>He said, "Yes, if you will."
    <br>Its not all up to God; certainly, it is not all up to you.
    <br>It takes you genuine willingness and God's ability to achieve something.
    <br>You can choose to overlook everything and open your Bible and read.
    <br>Don't look for the solution of the trouble you have, in the Bible.
    <br>Read Bible for the salvation of you soul.
    <br>Don't be searching for solution of your problem.
    <br>"I am sick. I want to see where Jesus healed the sick person in the Bible";
    <br>and you start searching for that - No!
    <br>"I am poor, I want to know who was poor like me in the Bible and was revived."
    <br>No, the Bible is not for that.
    <br>Therefore, when you want to sleep, don't open your Bible because of your trouble.
    <br>In the night, when you are about to sleep, you open the Bible to find something against your enemy.
    <br>You want to fire your enemy; you open Psalms 35, and you read.
    <br>After reading you place it under your pillow.
    <br>When your enemy comes, he will wake you up and say, "Come. Carry the thing you put under your pillow."
    <br>You will carry it, and he will use the same Bible to flog you.
    <br>By the time you wake up you say, " Ah! Does it mean that the bible is not the Word of God?
    <br>Why does the enemy use this Word to beat me?"
    <br>No. You make Bible work.
    <br>Bible itself cannot work; you make the Bible work.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "I make it work".
    <br>You make it work.
    <br>The Bible itself cannot just work.
    <br>You make it work, or not to work.
    <br>It's the library of apostles put together.
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Thank you, rise up...
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Ask for a free spirit.
    <br>You know I told you; meditation reveals the burden in our spirit.
    <br>Meditation exposes the burden in your spirit, the burden in you, the worry.
    <br>This is why we have faith bracelet.
    <br>When you meditate, "Take more of me, give me more of You", before you know it, the burden is gone.
    <br>You will begin to think of Jesus; then, you can pray.
    <br>You find joy, naturally;
    <br>it comes naturally,
    <br>It comes spontaneously.
    <br>Spontaneously - just naturally the joy comes.
    <br>Joy is not created by you and I.
    <br>It originates with God.
    <br>Joy!
    <br>"Take more of me; give me more of you..."
    <br>By the time you meditate this, that burden - worry is gone;
    <br>you would feel joy - a kind of inner joy.
    <br>That is the time to pray.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>This is why we call meditation a visit with God.
    <br>What is meditation?
    <br>Meditation in Gods Word is what?
    <br>A visit with God.
    <br>Meditation in Gods Word is a visit with God.
    <br>Now you are happy.
    <br>It does not mean that in coming hours there will be nothing troubling you.
    <br>You are a human, since you have flesh.
    <br>You will continue to have something troubling you, but you will continue to overcome.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>It is not that you will not have something troubling you in the future - no!
    <br>No, it is not in the Bible.
    <br>In this world there will be what?
    <br>There will be trouble!
    <br>"In this world there will be trouble. Cheer up; I have overcome" (John 16:33).
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why He said, "I pray your faith will not fail."
    <br>If He said, "your faith will not fail", it means there will be trouble that will tempt your faith.
    <br>"I pray your faith will not fail"; it means 
    <br>there will be time our faith will be shaken.
    <br>As you continue to live in this world, something will continue to come to threaten your faith.
    <br>And that thing helps to grow our relationship.
    <br>It is an instrument to grow our relationship.
    <br>That is the time you will see the need of God more.
    <br>- The need of who? 
    <br>- (God) - the  more.
    <br>It strengthens our desire and our determination for God.
    <br>It strengthens our what?
    <br>Our desire and determination for God.
    <br>It makes us to see the need for God.
    <br>He has prayed for us that our faith would not fail; that is the prayer He left behind.
    <br>He said to His disciple and you are one of them.
    <br>He said, "I pray that your faith will not fail".
    <br>It means your faith will be tested.
    <br>Ask your neighbor what is testing your faith, right now?
    <br>Ask you neighbor.
    <br>(What is testing your faith, right now?)
    <br>Remember, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That means that what you are going through - God is aware.
    <br>It has been prophesied, you will go through them.
    <br>But, it will not impair you but improve you.
    <br>It has been prophesied by our Lord Jesus Christ, "My disciples, My followers will go through this".
    <br>It has been prophesied.
    <br>If you are one of the followers, it will not impair you.
    <br>But if you are not of the followers, it will impair you.
    <br>If you are one of the followers, it will improve you - whatever you go through.
    <br>There can be no promotion without test.
    <br>There can be no improvement without test.
    <br>And what is your test?
    <br>What is my test?
    <br>What are you going through? 
    <br>What am I going through?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When it is time to go up, it is time to be tested.
    <br>Oh, I'm talking to you.
    <br>When it is time to go up, it is time to what?
    <br>(To be tested.)
    <br>He said, "I pray" - it was a prayer offered for you
    <br>This means that whatever you are going through has been prophesied.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- (Amen!)
    <br>So, it has been prophesied that this and that will happen.
    <br>Some things will be changeable and many will not be changeable.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is written.
    <br>It gladdens in my heart, anytime I read; when Jesus said...
    <br>He is aware of your cares and your trouble.
    <br>He says, your cares and worries - leave it to God, because He cares about you,
    <br>he is concerned about you.
    <br>Jesus loves you just as He loves every apostle.
    <br>And every apostle in the Bible, read about them,
    <br>everyone had their own what?
    <br>Challenges.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And their challenges strengthened their desire.
    <br>The apostles' challenges strengthened their desire.
    <br>They paid the supreme price to bring the Gospel you and I enjoy today.
    <br>What price have you paid?
    <br>I pray your faith will not fail, in Jesus name.
    <br>(Amen!)
