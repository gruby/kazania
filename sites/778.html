    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a woman - you put on a pad.
    <br>It is not your period.
    <br>You have been like that for some time now.
    <br>Sometimes, you don't have money, you put rug just to stop whatever coming out of your body.
    <br>It is no longer just a blood - your system is damaged.
    <br>Please, come out.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>You know Jesus can stop it.
    <br>Remember - a woman with the issue of blood - come out and enjoy the grace, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Surprised by hearing her case spoken about in the midst of a large congregation,
    <br>this lady comes forward knowing that the solution to her embarrassing problem had come.
    <br>Feeling the presence of God, she takes a deep breath, as she prepares herself for what is to come.
    <br>Man of God, I'm the woman; I'm bleeding very heavily out of my period,
    <br>and I'm still wearing a lot of pads because of that.
    <br>I am bleeding very heavily right now and I am not in my period,
    <br>and I'm wearing a lot of pads because of that situation, right now.
    <br>After the lady confirmed the prophecy to be a hundred percent true,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her and deliverance begins.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>She catches her stomach as a spiritual operation takes place.
    <br>The darkness that caused her to continually bleed is dispelled by God's great light.
    <br>Your back on the floor!
    <br>The Woman With The Issue Of BLOOD!!!
    <br>So, that is the end of your bleeding.
    <br>The Woman With The Issue Of BLOOD!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You - my daughter is free - thank You, Jesus!
    <br>With gratitude and adoration to God, the lady's mother raises her hands to the Most High
    <br>for setting her daughter free at last,
    <br>delivering her from the burden of constant bleeding for many years.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Bless the Lord.
    <br>My name is Lianna Douglas and I am from Trinidad and Tobago.
    <br>Next to me is my mother and my two sisters.
    <br>Last Sunday we were here.
    <br>I was having an issue of extreme bleeding; at times it becomes very embarrassing to me.
    <br>When the prophecy was given by the man of God, I was so shocked.
    <br>We have been looking at Emmanuel TV for so long, seeing these miracles,
    <br>and now I'm actually in the SCOAN.
    <br>Hearing this prophecy I was stunned, I froze, I couldn't believe it was me.
    <br>God really looked down to heal me.
    <br>When I came forward, the man of God did not touch me, he just pointed his hand towards me.
    <br>I felt the power of God touch my womb.
    <br>It was as if a plunger was pulling at my womb, like a suction.
    <br>Then, I just fell to the floor under the power of God.
    <br>Immediately that bleeding stopped.
    <br>The Woman With The Issue Of BLOOD!!!
    <br>Since then I feel much better; even everybody says I look much better.
    <br>I look at myself in the mirror and I realise that I look much better.
    <br>My stomach was very bulky and firm because I had multiple fibroids.
    <br>Since then it is very soft.
    <br>Now I'm totally free.
    <br>The Woman With The Issue Of BLOOD!!!
    <br>Lianna’s Mother & Family
    <br>My husband and I are pastors in the island of Trinidad and Tobago.
    <br>These are my three daughters.
    <br>We thank God for being here.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Before we came to this country, my daughter was bleeding profusely.
    <br>It was so bad that the doctors told her that they didn't want her to travel,
    <br>her blood count was very low.
    <br>She would be tense, nervous, palpitating, on her job she would have problems.
    <br>The bleeding was so intense.
    <br>When we got here, last Sunday, like the woman with the issue of blood; nobody knew us, we knew no one,
    <br>but God saw us.
    <br>Lianna’s Mother & Family
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>The man of God called my daughter out; it had to be God.
    <br>I sat there and said, "Who knows us here, Lord? What will we do?"
    <br>We made a demand on the anointing that was in the man of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When he made that call, it was so shocking.
    <br>I was looking forward but it was a unique thing.
    <br>When he made the call, I said, "Jesus, You have seen her".
    <br>She walked up.
    <br>He didn't touch her, he didn't even come close to her,
    <br>but the power of God penetrated her in a beam.
    <br>When she got up, and I looked at her, she said, "Mum, it's gone".
    <br>It was the last, it was caught - the power of the Holy Ghost in the Prophet of God.
    <br>Thank God for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank God for a Prophet who has made himself available,
    <br>so that God could use him to be a blessing to the world.
    <br>Glory to God!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>No more bleeding!
    <br>It has stopped by the hand of God.
    <br>I came to Nigeria purposely to the SCOAN.
    <br>I thank God that He allowed me and my three girls to reach safely the church, and we are here.
    <br>Thank God for Jesus!
    <br>We received more than what we came for.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Man of God, I would like to sing a song to thank God for what He has done for me.
    <br>The Woman With The Issue Of BLOOD!!!
    <br>Thank you.
