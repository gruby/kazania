  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>my prayer partners,
    <br>listen to me.
    <br>Come on,
    <br>let us believe together.
    <br>Those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
    <br>I say to that sickness, out!
    <br>You cancer, out!
    <br>You disease, out!
    <br>You infirmity in your bones,
    <br>in your blood,
    <br>in your kidneys,
    <br>in your liver,
    <br>in your flesh,
    <br>I say, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>My career,
    <br>my destiny,
    <br>it is your time to shine,
    <br>in Jesus' name!
    <br>Your career may hear the drum of setback;
    <br>you will only hear the drum,
    <br>but it is time to shine!
    <br>Say, Good Morning to your career!
    <br>Say, Good Morning to your marriage!
    <br>Say, Good Morning to your business!
    <br>Say, Good Morning to your finances!
    <br>Say, Good Morning to your destiny!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Viewers, whatever medium you are using to view us,
    <br>right now, listen to me.
    <br>Whatever situation you have been facing in your career,
    <br>whatever situation you have been facing in your business,
    <br>in your finances,
    <br>in your destiny,
    <br>your marriage,
    <br>it is time now.
    <br>This is the time you have been praying for to shine.
    <br>This is the time you have been praying for to move.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is the time I have been praying for to move".
    <br>"This is the time I have been praying for to shine".
    <br>"This is the time I have been praying for to overcome".
    <br>"This is the time I have been praying for to shout hallelujah!"
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Lord Jesus, bring comfort to all those who mourn,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Bring peace of heart to those under pressure and tension,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Bring blessing to the poor, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
