    <br>WARNING! The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>This woman has come to The SCOAN suffering from a cruel skin disease,
    <br>which has afflicted her entire body.
    <br>Her skin has become so sensitive that it flakes and peels off at the slightest touch,
    <br>rendering her unable to wear clothing.
    <br>She is a young lady, at only 25 years old but outwardly no one would know.
    <br>Disfigured by the brutal affliction, the skin all over her body has been affected
    <br>by this destructive skin disease.
    <br>Even her lips have become bright red, being raw and blistered by the delibitating ailment.
    <br>The skin looks as if it is slowly melting.
    <br>How can she talk, eat or have any form of normality in her life?
    <br>Just imagine the torment, agony and pain.
    <br>Let alone the shame and embarrassment such an ailment would bring.
    <br>WATCH INSTANT HEALING!!!
    <br>The skin has become like scales, cracked and broken up into pieces,
    <br>which then become dry, and either flake or peel off.
    <br>It is a gruesome sight and difficult to behold.
    <br>As we continue to watch, we clearly see that no place has been left untouched
    <br>by this ruthless and aggressive skin disease.
    <br>She is living a life of constant, unending pain.
    <br>Viewers, for a moment put yourself in her position
    <br>and imagine what life would be like in such a condition.
    <br>It is beyond what mere words can adequately describe.
    <br>Mrs Bose Stephen has come to The SCOAN, knowing that her case has gone beyond the power of nature.
    <br>Her sickness has gone beyond medical explanation and treatment.
    <br>It has become a curse and therefore requires divine intervention.
    <br>Who else can remove the curse but God.
    <br>Who else can justly do it.
    <br>It is non other than our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>By His death on the cross, Jesus broke the curse of sin and death that we deserve.
    <br>He purchased healing for us at the price of great suffering.
    <br>It is Christ's victory that gives us victory.
    <br>And it is a product of this victory that Mrs Stephen has come to The SCOAN to receive.
    <br>My name is Maria Ibukun.
    <br>The sister sitting beside you, who is she to you?
    <br>She is my sister from the same mother and father.
    <br>Tell us her name and her age.
    <br>Mrs Bose Stephen, 25 years old.
    <br>And she is your biological sister?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you tell us what the problem is that brought her to The SCOAN today?
    <br>Body poison.
    <br>She cannot eat, sit down, stand, sleep or talk.
    <br>She does not feel like talking because of this body poison?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We went to hospital. We have been at the hospital for a long time.
    <br>I believe that God will do a miracle in her life today to heal her.
    <br>We pray with you that Jesus, God Almighty, will set her free today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.

    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus! In the blood of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer in Jesus‘ Name
    <br>There is spiritual transformation.
    <br>You don’t need to be told that this woman cannot sleep, cannot do anything on her own
    <br>but right now you can see the power of God Almighty has set her free.
    <br>Look at her right now. Walking confidently and now she can be touched
    <br>but before now no one could touch her.
    <br>Look at what is coming out of the woman!
    <br>Look at the screen of the television! This is the substance of the poison.
    <br>This is the power of God.
    <br>This is marvellous, this is glorious, this is wonderful.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous and Bloody Substances
    <br>In excruciating pain and burning sensation all over her.
    <br>She was having loss of strength, loss of appetite, along other forms of symptoms
    <br>due to this terrible problem of body poison in her life.
    <br>That is the internal one.
    <br>The external one is the one you can see.
    <br>But the internal one – that is the one Jesus removed in your presence.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My wife is healed! I am happy now.
    <br>I can talk now. Before now, I could not talk.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Mrs Bose Stephen Testifying Amidst Visitors to The SCOAN
    <br>This is Pastor Harry from Rotterdam Christian Life Centre and Emmanuel Television.
    <br>I am here on this occasion in The SCOAN, Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>All around me, I am surrounded by people from all over this globe.
    <br>We have people here from Australia, South Africa, United States, Canada,
    <br>Germany, Switzerland, Austria, from all over the globe and last but not least
    <br>we also have people here from the Netherlands.
    <br>Let us welcome our brothers and sisters who are watching this programme right now
    <br>on television, with a big clap offering. Let’s give Jesus a big clap offering.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>My name is Bose Stephen.
    <br>What brought me here was body poison.
    <br>For so many years, we had gone to hospitals, native doctors
    <br>and many places but I couldn’t get cured.
    <br>But when I came to The SCOAN and the man of God stretched his hand
    <br>towards me, I received strength.
    <br>I started running! After running, when I stood, I vomited all the poison.
    <br>After some time, I felt so cold inside me.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Then, I could not even talk or eat but when the man of God
    <br>stretched his hand towards me, I started eating.
    <br>Hallelujah!
