  <p>    
    <br>There are many things we know that are happening in every country like the rejection of God.
    <br>It is one of the greatest sins.
    <br>The rejection of God is one of the greatest sins a nation can commit.
    <br>Idolatry, occultism, political misrule, corruption, injustice, child kidnapping, and murder.
    <br>Shedding innocent blood, tribal conflicts - these are the things we want to talk about and pray.
    <br>Today is to pray for forgiveness and mercy
    <br>and ask God to save our lands from the sins of injustice, exploitation,
    <br>occultism, child kidnapping and murder,
    <br>shedding innocent blood, political misrule and mismanagement.
    <br>We will take it one by one, those things that are being practiced in your country, like tribal conflicts.
    <br>We will ask for forgiveness; we will pray, and the message will be taken from Jeremiah 1:10.
    <br>God says He will give us utterances and once these utterances are given,
    <br>whatever we say here today shall be said in Heaven.
    <br>Whatever we loose shall be what?
    <br>Loosed in Heaven.
    <br>Whatever we bind shall be what?
    <br>Bound in Heaven.
    <br>Open with me the Book of Jeremiah 1 and take your reading from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>I want to take you to that verse 10.
    <br>" 'See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down,
    <br>to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant.' "
    <br>It is time to speak to our nations.
    <br>It is time to speak to our leaders and God has given us utterances - utterances to speak.
    <br>Whatever we say here shall be said in Heaven.
    <br>I said whatever you say here shall be said in Heaven.
    <br>These, our flags, are a symbol and our contact.
    <br>We are here today to confess all the sins and wrongs of the lands.
    <br>We are here today to confess all the sins of the lands, of our ancestors, of our leaders and of the people.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, this is the voice of God.
    <br>Are you ready to follow me?
    <br>We are going to offer this prayer and we will start as the Spirit directs.
    <br>We are here today to confess all the sins of the lands, of our ancestors, of our leaders and of the people.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The sins of iniquity, injustice, exploitation, child kidnapping and murder,
    <br>corruption, cultism, political misrule, immorality, injustice and shedding innocent blood.
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>We are going to confess.
    <br>Ask for forgiveness and mercy, in the name of Jesus!
