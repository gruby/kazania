    <br>PROPHECY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP ON SECURITY ISSUES!!! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸| Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>MY MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP
    <br>ON SECURITY ISSUES - TB JOSHUA
    <br>31 MAY 2020
    <br>During my prophecy for 2020 released on 28th December 2019,
    <br>prophecy number four concerning America was given as follows:
    <br>"Approach to the security issue will affect the candidates and swing voters in the next election."
    <br>President Trump, this is what is happening now.
    <br>Another one is coming.
    <br>President Trump, wake up to checkmate this.
    <br>It will go beyond this.
    <br>Another one is coming, starting from the ending of June.
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>During your regime, the name of Jesus has been given more honour.
    <br>What glory!
    <br>Let us look beyond our palace for God's authority.
    <br>With God, all things are possible!
    <br>Let us act now.
    <br>It is not all up to God; we have a role to play.
    <br>More appeals to the people and security are required -
    <br>in a language that will douse the tension and stop this situation -
    <br>so we can then commit the future one into God's hands.
