  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, get ready to witness the power of prophecy in action
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua encounters Mr Yabrifa during the Monday Service and speaks into his life:
    <br>Can I talk to you?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine, thank you.
    <br>Do you know the reason why I come to you?
    <br>- You are a traditionalist.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- A witch doctor.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>You have some spiritual energy.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by energy?
    <br>Some native power.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>This native power you can use it to change...
    <br>A situation whereby it wants to rain, you can stop rain.
    <br>Yes, with white gin I can stop a storm or heavy rain.
    <br>- That's what I'm saying.
    <br>- It's true, sir.
    <br>'I Can STOP The RAIN' - Witchdoctor CONFESSIONS!
    <br>While you were sitting down I saw... around you.
    <br>- But when I got to you, they ran.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Around you... and you used to see them.
    <br>- They are very small like this.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>They are small like babies.
    <br>When I came here, they went to my house and flogged my wife very well.
    <br>Oh, I'm sorry mum.
    <br>This is my wife.
    <br>Is this your wife whom those small things flogged?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>They call them 'esu'.
    <br>Sometimes, some of them use their head to walk.
    <br>You cannot even sleep on those days.
    <br>When your husband came here, those 'egbere' went to flog you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>- They flogged you?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>How did they flog you when your husband came here?
    <br>They flogged me saying, "You, this woman!"
    <br>They flogged me and tied my hands at my back and flogged me very hard.
    <br>- Because your husband came to The SCOAN?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Sometimes, the door would open but you would not know who opened the door.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>It's because of that you don't want to stay in your house alone.
    <br>- You are always afraid.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>This energy; I call it energy.
    <br>This is not power; we don't regard it as power.
    <br>You have beads on your hand.
    <br>Where are they?
    <br>I did not bring them but I brought my pictures.
    <br>OK, bring your picture.
    <br>- They have given you a title, Traditional Man.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- A form of a king.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- A lot of people are coming to you for power.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>As I'm talking to you now, almost ten people are waiting to see you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>When they want to do a party, if they don't consult you, it can start raining.
    <br>When pastors come to our place -
    <br>because it is a place where they always come to hold crusades -
    <br>they always abuse the god I am serving.
    <br>Sometimes, I would come out with annoyance with kaikai or white gin
    <br>and command rain on them and they would all run away.
    <br>It rains and the crusade would scatter?
    <br>Everybody would run away and the rain would stop.
    <br>Go and wait.
    <br>We will listen to you and you will be delivered.
    <br>'I Can STOP The RAIN' - Witchdoctor CONFESSIONS!
    <br>Are they not one of the people you patronise?
    <br>They are the ones you patronise.
    <br>This is to tell you that The Almighty is all.
    <br>Why can't you seek the face of God?
    <br>I was supposed to go there but I saw heavy...
    <br>I said, "In my church, where is... ?"
    <br>In exact confirmation of Prophet T.B. Joshua's prophecy,
    <br>the footage you are about to watch shows the activities
    <br>of Mr Oba Yabrifa, a witch doctor.
    <br>Here is a community shrine where Mr Oba Yabrifa,
    <br>the man who Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied about, lives as a chief priest.
    <br>It is named 'labakolo', meaning the god of justice.
    <br>This is Mr Yabrifa adorned in his diabolical attire, carrying a staff,
    <br>signifying his position in the community as a chief priest.
    <br>In a traditional ceremony he empties a bottle of hard liquor,
    <br>as an appeasement to the deity he worships.
    <br>He proceeds on his journey through the village with his followers behind him.
    <br>Mr Yabrifa lead the way, as the large procession continues to walk through the village.
    <br>He brushes through a straw entrance, as they move into yet another shrine.
    <br>In his position as a chief priest of the deity in the community,
    <br>many people travel from far and wide to meet with and consult him.
    <br>Dressed in his traditional attire, these are just a few of those who have come to seek help from him,
    <br>with the diabolical powers he had acquired as a witch doctor.
    <br>One by one they enter his abode and bow down before him,
    <br>showing the level of power and influence he holds in the community.
    <br>You can see this young man slowly coming forward
    <br>and with utmost respect kneeling down before Mr Yabrifa
    <br>to present an offering that would be sacrificed to the deity 'labakolo'.
    <br>Here are various assortments of meat, which are part of the ritual sacrifices,
    <br>that regularly take place in the shrine.
    <br>The meat of the slaughtered animals is cooked to be served in a fetish feast,
    <br>in celebration of the deity 'labakolo'.
    <br>A crowd has gathered to join in the sacrificial feast.
    <br>The food is followed by a traditional dance to the deity.
    <br>Traditional Dancing After The Feast
    <br>'I Can STOP The RAIN' - Witchdoctor CONFESSIONS!
    <br>The following day, followers of Mr Yabrifa perform a ritual cleansing of the neighbourhood.
    <br>Dressed in white and red, they dance through the streets singing,
    <br>banging their native percussion drums,
    <br>and carrying various plates of uncooked foods.
    <br>They begin to throw pieces and pellets of uncooked food along the streets.
    <br>Here is Mr Yabrifa fully clad in his priestly apparel.
    <br>Notice the chalk marks on his face and the staff he boldly carries in his right hand.
    <br>How did Mr Yabrifa ascend to such a position of power?
    <br>What draws all these people to follow his every move?
    <br>What strange powers does he possess and how does he use them?
    <br>Keep watching to hear the full confession of Mr Yabrifa after he came to The SCOAN,
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua picked him out from the crowd,
    <br>through a powerful word of prophecy.
    <br>My name is Abiudun Yabrifa, but they call me Oba.
    <br>Last Monday, the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>He said I was a witch doctor and I had some energy around me.
    <br>I had some powers, I could stop rain; I could call rain
    <br>and he said there were small deities around me that he was seeing.
    <br>And it is true.
    <br>All what the man of God said is true.
    <br>I was a chief priest.
    <br>My grandfather was the chief priest of that deity.
    <br>After my grandfather died, they were looking for someone to become the chief priest.
    <br>Although, I was not yet born at that time.
    <br>So, until my mother gave birth to me,
    <br>from my childhood visioners said, "This is the chief priest of that throne."
    <br>Really, when I grew, I grew up like that.
    <br>I used to go to the river when I was a young boy.
    <br>The kind of fish I would bring from the river was not even dead.
    <br>I would bring it to my mother; she would be confused
    <br>because of the kind of things I would bring from the river.
    <br>I would bring chains, rings and even coins from the olden days.
    <br>I brought these things to the house.
    <br>From there they knew that something was disturbing me.
    <br>I, as well, knew that I was from the sea, from childhood because
    <br>sometimes, I would see myself in the high sea
    <br>where I had a woman and children.
    <br>When it got to a time, I went to Port Harcourt to work.
    <br>I was very stubborn in the village, only me, single-handedly could pursue a football field.
    <br>Everybody would run, nobody could do anything to me.
    <br>Even in the field of wrestling, when I would come out, if they would not allow me to wrestle,
    <br>I would pursue everybody at the wrestling field.
    <br>After some time, I went to Port Harcourt to look for a job because I didn't have anything.
    <br>When I got a job at Port Harcourt,
    <br>one day, the deity changed to my father and went to my working place.
    <br>He told the man that had employed me that he should take me back home
    <br>or whatever happened to me he would hold him responsible.
    <br>I found some of my people to beg the man saying, "Please, nothing will happen."
    <br>After that, I had a serious accident.
    <br>Finally, I agreed to become the chief priest of that throne.
    <br>There, I controlled people, I had total power.
    <br>Any human being that I saw, I felt they were very small things
    <br>because of the power in me; everybody bowed down before me.
    <br>People from different areas would come to my shrine.
    <br>In short, there was no kind of person that didn't come there
    <br>to solve their problems at my place.
    <br>One day, I got to know that I had serious power
    <br>when a person invited me somewhere in the high sea.
    <br>When I was going there and I reached the high sea,
    <br>I saw big waves coming towards me.
    <br>When I looked at the waves, I saw a big snake coming to me and
    <br>my grandfather was serving that deity, that snake god, so I knew him
    <br>and I knew the kind of food he took.
    <br>When the waves were coming towards me, I stood up and poured hard liquor
    <br>into the water and I threw native chalk to the snake.
    <br>From there, the whole sea calmed down for me to pass
    <br>while some people were afraid that we would become lost there.
    <br>And I used to control rain.
    <br>Sometimes, these pastors - because I have a very big playing ground,
    <br>where I used to do my festivals and people would come and play there -
    <br>on ordinary days, pastors would come to do crusades.
    <br>Almost every week, they would come and do crusades there.
    <br>When they would come, they would call the god I was serving and
    <br>some people were not from our place.
    <br>But when they went to our place, they would mention the names of those deities I was serving.
    <br>The whole preaching would be about these deities.
    <br>They would abuse them.
    <br>I became angry and said, 'A pastor that doesn't even have power.
    <br>I am sleeping and he is trying to wake me up. OK, I'm coming.'
    <br>I would go directly to the shrine and take my bottle of gin.
    <br>When I would come out, they would not know.
    <br>I would libate and then call down a heavy storm for them.
    <br>Sometimes, they would be watching a film through a projector.
    <br>The storm would destroy everything and they would pack their loads and run away.
    <br>I would laugh at them and say, "Look at these people; they don't even have power."
    <br>With the power I had, even my wife sitting down here,
    <br>when she was menstruating, she could not cook food for me.
    <br>I didn't shake hands with human beings.
    <br>I used my hand to serve the deity.
    <br>Nobody touched my head.
    <br>I did not bow for any shrine.
    <br>I could not remove my cap or shoes before entering any place
    <br>like others did because I served the god of justice.
    <br>I was the chief priest.
    <br>I was the father of all spirits.
    <br>If you saw my pictures, you would see a garment with different colours.
    <br>All the servants - people who followed me in my shrine
    <br>they agreed to sew that garment for me because I was the father of all the spirits.
    <br>This is the garment.
    <br>The people who worshipped with me sewed this garment for me,
    <br>that I was the father of every colour; there was nothing I could not do.
    <br>Even pastors used to come to me.
    <br>You know I'm a pastor.
    <br>We don't come to you.
    <br>The people who came to you are spiritualists. They were not pastors.
    <br>There is a difference between a pastor and a spiritualist.
    <br>Anybody can say he is a pastor, like you say you are a king.
    <br>This is a title.
    <br>Those people who said they were pastors - they are not pastors, they are spiritualists.
    <br>A pastor would not come to you.
    <br>'I Can STOP The RAIN' - Witchdoctor CONFESSIONS!
    <br>Man of God, what brought me here was that I didn't like you or Jesus Christ.
    <br>When my wife used to watch Emmanuel TV, I used to tell her not to watch it
    <br>because I didn't like T.B. Joshua's programmes.
    <br>So, I didn't like T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I didn't like Jesus either.
    <br>But my wife continued to watch this programme.
    <br>After the persons would confess and T.B. Joshua would declare them innocent of witchcraft,
    <br>I saw that the man of God had the power to deliver the people who were witches.
    <br>After the deliverance, they would be innocent and unaware of any confession of witchcraft.
    <br>I would ask myself what kind of power he had because I could not do it.
    <br>What he is saying is that after people are being delivered,
    <br>we would ask the person, "You said this?" "No. I don't know why I said this."
    <br>We say now that it is not him who said it, it was the spirit within him, and the spirit is gone.
    <br>We are not fighting the flesh and blood but the spirit beings.
    <br>But in their case - they fight the flesh, they fight the blood.
    <br>They disagree with that.
    <br>They say, "Why should I say that for such a person,
    <br>it is the spirit in her, and now she is free, she is innocent?"
    <br>No, they don't believe that - that is an offence.
    <br>I discovered that the man of God had power, that he could deliver people whom I couldn't deliver.
    <br>So, I gained a little bit of interest from that place.
    <br>I saw that what this man was doing was something strange, which I could not do.
    <br>Why can't you do them?
    <br>I could not do it.
    <br>I tried to see whether I could deliver somebody who was a witch.
    <br>But no way; I could not do it.
    <br>Because you yourself are one of them.
    <br>There is no way you can use darkness to deliver darkness.
    <br>It is light that can do that job.
    <br>'I Can STOP The RAIN' - Witchdoctor CONFESSIONS!
    <br>I brought my son to this place because people always looked for me and sometimes, I would travel.
    <br>When I was not in the village, every Sunday, I would pour libation there.
    <br>If I was not there, I would send my son to pour libation, like my second in command.
    <br>He is also powerful.
    <br>Let's ask the little boy.
    <br>Little boy, you have the power too, don't you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Finally, I gained interest and wanted to come to The SCOAN because
    <br>the god I was serving, was a pity, I was a very poor person.
    <br>All that money, I didn't know where it went.
    <br>I drank and womanised.
    <br>In fact, I don't know what to say.
    <br>I pitied my life at times because I struggled to buy a car.
    <br>I had a very old okada that I used to ride.
    <br>Sometimes, when I travelled somewhere and was caught in heavy rain,
    <br>I would say to myself, 'This god that I am serving, everybody bows down for me
    <br>but the people who bow for me have cars.'
    <br>Also, when I looked at pastors - they were doing well;
    <br>they were driving cars while I was continuously suffering.
    <br>I begged before I could pay my children's school fees.
    <br>So, I began to have second thoughts.
    <br>I decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I told some people that I wanted to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>they asked how I could go to T.B. Joshua saying,
    <br>'Are you not more powerful than T.B. Joshua? He can never deliver you.'
    <br>The first day I came to this place, my wife called me when I had not yet reached Ughelli.
    <br>She said that one of our daughters carried hot water and poured it.
    <br>I asked her, "Why?"
    <br>After some time, she called me again and said the older sister took her sibling
    <br>to climb an electric wire; so, she fell down and broke her jaw.
    <br>I asked what was happening.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, my wife called me again and said
    <br>that there were some small demons flogging her seriously in the house,
    <br>that she could not sleep in the house anymore.
    <br>I said, "Oh, what am I going to do?"
    <br>What did they say was the reason that they flogged her?
    <br>It was because I was leaving them.
    <br>It was because I was leaving them and going to The SCOAN.
    <br>They were annoyed.
    <br>'I Can STOP The RAIN' - Witchdoctor CONFESSIONS!
    <br>Let your wife tell us how those things looked like,
    <br>those small-small children that flogged her.
    <br>You saw them with your eyes?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>How did they look like?
    <br>They were very small.
    <br>They entered and began to flog you?
    <br>Yes. They tied my hands behind my back, warned me and then flogged me.
    <br>They said that as my husband was leaving them, they were annoyed
    <br>and so they came to me.
    <br>They warned me.There were five of them. None of them wore clothes.
    <br>They were very black and short.
    <br>And you saw them with your eyes.
    <br>Yes. I was shouting and when I opened my eyes, I saw them, live.
    <br>I shouted. I wanted to run outside and a pastor's wife told me that
    <br>whatever bad dreams I had, I should not run outside,
    <br>that I had better stand my ground and pray.
    <br>I could not go out. I had to take my phone and flash from where I sat down.
    <br>I didn't see anything. I had to pray and call my husband that night.
    <br>And on that day, the thing that gave me strength is that light came,
    <br>so, I put on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>'I Can STOP The RAIN' - Witchdoctor CONFESSIONS!
    <br>But you have never seen them before?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>That was the first time.
    <br>My husband and I had no problem when we first married
    <br>but because of all these things, we were having problems all the time.
    <br>He would always beat me.
    <br>He didn't stay at home.
    <br>Every moment, he was with other women; so, I was crying, every day.
    <br>I want the man of God to help us and bring us together.
    <br>So, you have a lot of followers?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Not only you - if only you are delivered, we have not done anything right.
    <br>All your followers - if not 100 percent, 99 percent of them - that is your duty.
    <br>You take your time to meet them one on one and let them know that you have seen that light.
    <br>And I will have time to attend to them.
    <br>That is your job.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>That is another assignment for us to make sure we reach those followers,
    <br>all over the world, wherever they are.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Man of God, I dreamt after I was arrested.
    <br>I dreamt that you followed me to my place, my village
    <br>and we were at the big shrine where I used to serve the deities every four days.
    <br>I packed all those things to burn them before I came here.
    <br>But I could not burn them.
    <br>But I dreamt that you were there delivering all my people in my house there.
