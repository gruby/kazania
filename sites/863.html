  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, just as angels of God visited Paul and Silas,
    <br>they are on their way to you.
    <br>Viewers, listen. I mean it! Just as angels of God visited Paul and Silas in the prison,
    <br>right now, they are on their way to you.
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Satan can only be defeated when you walk in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Right now, I repeat: Just as angels of God visited Paul and Silas in the prison yard,
    <br>right now, they are on their way to you - to heal you, deliver you, bless you!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess Christ Jesus! Mean it!
    <br>I say, the angels of God are on their way to you - to heal you, to deliver you.
    <br>Begin to receive!
    <br>This is the word from God - receive!
    <br>Healing to your soul, to your flesh! Be healed, be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive!
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, listen to me.
    <br>Because you are a child of God, satan has to listen.
    <br>Satan can only listen when we walk in Christ Jesus,
    <br>You are a child of God and you walk in Christ Jesus,
    <br>you talk in Christ Jesus, you look in Christ Jesus, you pray in Christ Jesus, you stand in Christ Jesus -
    <br>in Him you do all.
    <br>Satan, you must listen. I command you, in the name of Jesus, hear me.
    <br>You have to listen, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I command you, right now, you satan -
    <br>I walk in Christ Jesus because I am a child of God -
    <br>I talk in Christ Jesus,  I pray in Christ Jesus, I look in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Right now, you have to listen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out of my life, out of my way, out of my career, out of my finances, out of my business,
    <br>out of my marital life, out of my family, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>The Word of God that said, "Let there be light" and there was light,
    <br>is saying, "Let there be light in your life, in your organs - let there be light!"
    <br>One thing you must recognise - darkness is sickness; infirmity is sickness.
    <br>Yes. Darkness stands for sickness. Infirmity stands for darkness.
    <br>Therefore, wherever these are in your system, let there be light, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Receive light in your bones!
    <br>Receive light in your kidneys!
    <br>Receive light in your bones!
    <br>Receive light in your liver!
    <br>Receive light in your blood!
    <br>Receive light in your fluids!
    <br>Light, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
