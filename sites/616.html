  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>My time does not work; God's time works.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[My time does not work; God's time works.]
    <br>When the case is very tense, you begin to speak to yourself,
    <br>different language, "I don't know... where is...".
    <br>I am sorry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your time does not work; God's time does.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The Book of Romans 10:1 before going to the proof text of today.
    <br>"Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved."
    <br>That is prayer for Israelites.
    <br>"For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge."
    <br>That is on knowledge of truth.
    <br>"Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own,
    <br>they did not submit to God's righteousness."
    <br>As a Christian, with the heart, man testifies, man knows that Jesus is righteousness.
    <br>We are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Let's go to the proof text verse 9.
    <br>"If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,'
    <br>and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
    <br>you will be saved."
    <br>With the heart, we know Christ is righteousness.
    <br>But on their own, they have not yet declared in their heart
    <br>that God raised Jesus from the dead.
    <br>They have not yet.
    <br>Belief in the heart.
    <br>Say to yourself, "Belief in the heart".
    <br>As the Bible stated, belief in my heart.
    <br>Belief in your heart.
    <br>Belief in the heart.
    <br>Just as there is a faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ for salvation,
    <br>there is a faith towards the Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost for power.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Just as there is a faith towards our Lord Jesus for salvation,
    <br>there is a faith towards the Holy Ghost for power.
    <br>We are talking about the belief in the heart, belief in your heart, belief in my heart.
    <br>Anyway you see we talk about heart, man's heart -
    <br>man's spirit, man's heart.
    <br>The more you meditate about what you read in the Bible,
    <br>the more your spirit, that is your heart, acts upon the Word you read.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In a literal way, the word, 'meditate' means 'think'.
    <br>How can we get the Word into our heart, into our spirit?
    <br>You get the Word into your spirit when you read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>It's not the kind you are reading in school.
    <br>You have to read, you have to read fast.
    <br>So fast, you understand what you are reading? No. That's not...
    <br>You must be carried along by the Holy Spirit when you are reading the Bible.
    <br>That is why you have to wait for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Wait for the Holy Spirit".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Wait for the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Wait for the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>Read slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>While you are reading, you just read because you understand what you are reading.
    <br>That understanding is mental assent.
    <br>Intellectual agreement.
    <br>Intellectual creation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To take the Word into our heart, into our spirit,
    <br>you must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>When you read something slowly, it means you give all your attention.
    <br>If there are many things to think about, you can't read slowly.
    <br>You can't even meditate if there are things around to overwhelm you.
    <br>So, it means to read slowly is to stay focused.
    <br>'Attentively' means off, on the outside, on, on the inside.
    <br>That is attentively.
    <br>'Repeatedly' means you have to go back again, trying to figure out the message that is personal
    <br>and insert your name where the message is personal.
    <br>That is repeatedly - you have to go back again.
    <br>Not that you don't understand what you have read,
    <br>but you just have to understand it in God's way.
    <br>In the Holy Spirit way, you have to go back again
    <br>and look at those messages that are personal - you can insert your name.
    <br>We are talking to ourselves as if we are Sunday school children.
    <br>If you knew your level in the spirit, you would know you are a baby.
    <br>When it comes to the things of the spirit, you are not a graduate.
    <br>You are just in kindergarten.
    <br>You are just learning A, B, C.
    <br>We have to go back again because you will soon forget.
    <br>That is, the things of the Spirit.
    <br>Let someone say, "A, B, C".
    <br>[A, B, C.]
    <br>Say it again, you have forgotten.
    <br>[A, B, C.]
    <br>That is, the things of the Spirit.
    <br>This is why we have to come back again.
    <br>We need to come back to this issue of faith
    <br>because many of us are doing foolish things and call it faith.
    <br>We are doing foolish things and call it what? - Faith.
    <br>A good example:
    <br>You try to imitate me because I bought a car
    <br>after ministering the Morning Water three times.
    <br>Immediately you listened to that,
    <br>you tell your neighbor around you, "Where is that Morning Water?"
    <br>They say, it is opposite.
    <br>Whatever the minister of God is saying, it is zero to you.
    <br>In fact, you are off until you get that Morning Water.
    <br>And when you now get it, you spray it three times.
    <br>"Ah, the man said, three times
    <br>but I forgot to ask the man which part of the body he sprayed it on.
    <br>I need to know where he sprayed the Morning Water on."
    <br>"Ok, I have got Morning Water." - you start looking for money in the church.
    <br>"Uncle, how are you? Congratulation."
    <br>He is going somewhere, saying, "Congratulation".
    <br>"You said in that testimony, you sprayed the Morning Water."
    <br>"Yes."
    <br>"Which location of your body?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The man says, "I sprayed it around. At 12 midnight, I sprayed it.
    <br>At 3 am, I sprayed it; at 6 am, I sprayed it".
    <br>It means, you will not sleep because you want to do the same.
    <br>At 12 o'clock, you wake up and spray it around.
    <br>At 3 am, you spray it around - this is imitation.
    <br>God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.]
    <br>Faith is not an imitation.
    <br>These are the foolish things we call faith.
    <br>This is what they are talking about here, about Israelites.
    <br>You are being taken to the family church.
    <br>They will face this way and say, "Hallelujah".
    <br>You too, you keep repeating the same.
    <br>Not that God revealed to you, to face those corners.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>God will meet you when you take action in obedience.
    <br>Try to check many of our homes.
    <br>When you lift the pillow, you will see a Bible under the pillow.
    <br>And what is common there is Psalm 35.
    <br>You want to kill your enemy because this is what you inherited from your parents.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are foolish things we call faith.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>With the heart, you believe that Jesus is righteousness.
    <br>Take note of the practical side of it:
    <br>Our spirit joins itself.
    <br>Our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>When our spirit acts upon the Word, all we need to do is use our faith
    <br>to put the demand upon the anointing.
    <br>Anointing is there. It is not from you but from God, it's God Himself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All you need to do is use your faith to put a demand upon the anointing.
    <br>Just as there is a faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ for salvation,
    <br>there is a faith towards the Holy Ghost for power.
    <br>The title of the message: Belief in our heart.
    <br>I take it again: "If you declare with your mouth" -
    <br>you don't need to pay any price to say, "Jesus is Lord"; anybody can say that.
    <br>But the area we are talking about is: belief in your heart.
    <br>"Belief in my heart" - say it to your neighbour.
    <br>This is where your problem lies.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The one you confess and the one in your heart are not in one accord.
    <br>You have 'A' in your heart and you say 'B' with your mouth.
    <br>This is the problem.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Each time you say, "Be healed!", that is not in your heart.
    <br>That is why there is no healing.
    <br>"Be delivered!" - that is not in your heart.
    <br>Each time you say, "Lord, bless me",
    <br>the blessing comes out of your mouth but it is not in your heart.
    <br>That is why you are not blessed.
    <br>You have been praying for blessing but nothing to show.
    <br>You have been praying for healing - nothing to show.
    <br>Let someone say, "Belief in our heart".
    <br>- I can't hear you.
    <br>- Belief in our heart.
    <br>To have this belief in our heart, read your Bible slowly.
    <br>When you want to read your Bible slowly, you need a private and a quiet place for yourself.
    <br>If I'm talking to you...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need a quiet and a private place.
    <br>Even your radio, television must be switched off.
    <br>And most importantly, you need nature around you to read the Bible slowly.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by nature?
    <br>Nature will help you.
    <br>Nature of God - trees, beautiful sea, beach.
    <br>A quiet environment - you see birds, some beautiful places.
    <br>Not just artificial things around.
    <br>You need nature around you to read slowly.
    <br>It is not where you display your skin.
    <br>It is a place where God, the Holy Spirit will carry you along.
    <br>Say, "Read slowly".
    <br>And now to read 'attentively' means, you have left it for God - everything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Make sure you read from the Book itself,
    <br>not all this technology you have around you.
    <br>You can use your technology to revise.
    <br>But to read slowly, attentively and repeatedly,
    <br>take your Bible itself, not just technology things.
    <br>When you are pressing, other things crop up.
    <br>That takes you off.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Time for God is time for your life and for the Kingdom.
    <br>Read slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>After you have read slowly and attentively, now you come back again.
    <br>Repeatedly - again what you have read, mark it; which one is personal.
    <br>Because you do not read to preach and teach it alone, but to live it.
    <br>The more you read slowly, attentively and repeatedly,
    <br>the more you think, the more you meditate on what you have read
    <br>and the more your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>Until your spirit acts upon it, you cannot deliver.
    <br>You know the Word saves, blesses, delivers, heals.
    <br>When your spirits acts upon the Word, you can deliver.
    <br>To deliver is to heal, deliver, save, bless with it.
    <br>The question now:
    <br>If the words you are speaking in prayer,
    <br>if the words you are speaking in preaching,
    <br>if the words you are speaking in counselling are not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>they will be idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>This is why when you say, "In the name of Jesus"
    <br>and that word is not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>satan will attack you because you are disturbing satan.
    <br>When he hears the name of Jesus, he wants to listen to it
    <br>and to know, who is speaking the name of Jesus: Is it by the authority of God?
    <br>If not, he will bounce on you.
    <br>It is better you remain without prayer.
    <br>It is better not to pray than to pray without the Spirit of God.
    <br>It is like you carry a banana inside the bush.
    <br>When a monkey sees you, what will happen?
    <br>It will attack you.
    <br>But if you don't carry a banana and you enter the bush, you are safe.
    <br>When you pray without the Spirit of the Father,
    <br>the prayer will be idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>Do you know that the Word of God is a tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit?
    <br>How can you now be using tools and the person carrying the tools
    <br>is not carrying it - can tools work on their own?
    <br>Can you just carry a gun, drop it on the ground and say, it will shoot?
    <br>The word you speak is a tool in the hands...
    <br>Look at me now. If I don't speak, this Bible cannot speak by itself.
    <br>So, it means, the Bible is the Word and I that is talking is the Spirit that makes it work.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If the word we speak in prayer is not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>it will be idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>So now you can see the reason: you pray, fast - at the end of the day, you have diabetes
    <br>and at the end of the day, problem combined increase,
    <br>you keep asking yourself, "I have a problem and I'm a Christian. Why all this, why all that?"
    <br>Do you know that the Word of God is Spirit?
    <br>The Spirit is greater than material things.
    <br>Once you know that the Spirit is greater than material things, I'm happy to hear that.
    <br>The Spirit is greater than material things.
    <br>Even you are a product of that Spirit.
    <br>Without the Spirit of God, all your praying, fasting, preaching, counselling,
    <br>sleeping in the church, being an usher, being an elder,
    <br>whatever you say you are doing in the church - in vain.
    <br>Now to have this Spirit of God, to contact the Spirit of God,
    <br>for your spirit to act upon the Word to declare you are a child of God,
    <br>read your Bible slowly.
    <br>A time to read the Bible is a time for devotion.
    <br>Devotion means, "I don't want to see anybody, I don't want to hear anything.
    <br>Outside what I'm doing, I don't want to hear it".
    <br>Slowly.
    <br>I know you are very brilliant, I know you have the key to the language
    <br>but when it comes to that, your gift is dull understanding, dull comprehension.
    <br>Read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>Come back again to read, to go over what you have read.
    <br>Take note of those messages that are personal; insert your name.
    <br>As you are reading the Bible, it is reading you.
    <br>It is like, if this table is not there, you are not allowed to put this thing down.
    <br>So this is your faith.
    <br>If there is no table here, you cannot...
    <br>The table is already here - that is why the Bible says, "I set a table before you".
    <br>And once the table is set before you, you just need to stretch your hand genuinely;
    <br>that is the word 'faith'.
    <br>The word 'faith' means genuinely.
    <br>You must put it down with all your heart - that is what the Bible means.
    <br>If you don't put it down with all your heart, you will begin to say,
    <br>"Oh, I don't know what pushed me to put it down and I don't want to put it down.
    <br>Now I have put this thing down now. What will I realise at the end?
    <br>Maybe I should take it back.
    <br>Many people are putting it down. I have to put it down.
    <br>If I don't put it down, people will call me names.
    <br>I'm ashamed. I have to join them in putting it down".
    <br>You are not putting that thing down genuinely, with all your heart.
    <br>When it is thanksgiving or offering or the man of God says, "Stand up for prayer",
    <br>when you hear, "Stand up", you will stand up,
    <br>you see others standing up, you will stand up - that is imitation.
    <br>If your spirit does not agree with that standing up, you will sit down;
    <br>it does not mean you are disobeying.
    <br>If I say, "In Jesus' name", if you don't believe, don't say, "Amen".
    <br>But because you hear, "In Jesus' name", it is a tradition to say, "Amen" which is wrong.
    <br>You are supposed to say, "Amen" because you believe.
    <br>You will not meet God because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>Let someone say, "Belief in our heart".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Belief in our heart.]
    <br>Belief in our heart.
    <br>Something can only influence you when it comes from your heart -
    <br>to influence your conduct and your character.
    <br>And everybody out there knows you as a born again
    <br>whereas genuinely, you are not a born again.
    <br>We cannot continue to live in pretence.
    <br>It's the most dangerous thing.
    <br>Have a place in your house where there is a garden, quiet place.
    <br>Read slowly, attentively and repeatedly; then, you will see yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can I ask you a question? What will you do with this message?
    <br>I will put the Word of God to work by reading the Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>What is your tactic of reading slowly?
    <br>My tactic of reading slowly is to make sure when I get home that I find a cool place,
    <br>like a sea or a garden where I can practise it
    <br>by reading the Word of God slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>Did you listen to what he was saying?
    <br>When you want to read slowly, you think inwardly.
    <br>Time for you, time for God now.
    <br>Leave all for God; don't worry yourself because you are about to read about God -
    <br>God, within and without.
    <br>You have to think inwardly first.
    <br>Maybe you have a problem with your wife or your wife has a problem with you
    <br>and this has come to disturb you.
    <br>You have so much weight, burden.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
