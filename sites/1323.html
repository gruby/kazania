    <br>Give your neighbor a handshake, say:  "Emmanuel"
    <br>Give your other neighbor a handshake, say: "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbor behind you a handshake, say:  "Emmanuel."
    <br>Give the neighbor in front of you a handshake, say: "Emmanuel."
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV: "Emmanuel!!"
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "God is with us."
    <br>Yes, you are welcome once again to the arena of liberty, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Right now, you may have your seats in the presence of God and say: "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Brother Chris and I have the wonderful privilege today to share with you
    <br>the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Turn to your neighbor and say: "Neighbor, what a God we have to worship!
    <br>What a Son we have to praise!
    <br>What a future lies before us!"
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "Neighbor, I have a good destiny! I'm a child of promise!
    <br>I have a wonderful future!"
    <br>If you believe that, put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, to begin today's message, I just want to share with you a very short story.
    <br>This was several years ago. We were having a prayer line service here in the church.
    <br>And you know our prayer line services are very large.
    <br>We had thousands upon thousands of people.
    <br>We were making announcements, trying to arrange people according to the nature of their challenges
    <br>so that we could attend to them as swiftly and quickly as possible.
    <br>I was there at the front with a microphone making these announcements
    <br>and it got to a part where I said: "Anyone here who is a pregnant woman?
    <br>All pregnant women who have come for the safe delivery of their babies, please come out!"
    <br>So of course, you see these heavily pregnant women coming forward -
    <br>8 to 9 months pregnant - getting ready because they came for prayer.
    <br>But in the midst of the women, I saw a man.
    <br>I looked twice and thought: "This is definitely a man.
    <br>Let me have a bit of a joke here."
    <br>So I announced:  "Please, we did not announce for pregnant men.
    <br>We announced for pregnant women.
    <br>If you are a pregnant man, please go back to your seat."
    <br>And the man truly went back to his seat.
    <br>Afterwards, I thought: "Why would this man join the pregnant women that came forward?"
    <br>After this I said: "Okay, now, if we do have any pregnant men here, you can come forward."
    <br>Do you know what happened? The man came forward - a young man.
    <br>I looked at him and said: "Is this guy okay?"
    <br>Because stature-wise, he's of normal stature and I've never heard of a pregnant man.
    <br>But you know, in this our generation anything is possible.
    <br>I said, "Let me ask this man".
    <br>So this man walked boldly forward; he's a pregnant man.
    <br>I said: "Sir, do you mean to say that you are pregnant?"
    <br>He looked at me and said: "Yes."
    <br>I said, "You don't look very pregnant".
    <br>He said, "I'm pregnant with a bright future!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So I now said: "Okay. What do you need prayer for then?"
    <br>He said: "I need prayer for the safe delivery of my dream!"
    <br>I now tricked him and said: "Okay, where is your medical report?"
    <br>He said: "Oga, I don't have a medical report.
    <br>But I need prayer because I have a bright future and I need to be released into that future."
    <br>Long story short, because of that bold step,
    <br>that man went to the prayer line that day.
    <br>And I'm very sure wherever he is, he has a wonderful testimony to share.
    <br>Why am I saying this little story?
    <br>First and foremost, I want to tell everyone here, viewers all over the world,
    <br>that God has given you a good destiny.
    <br>This is not a matter of "Amen". It's a fact.
    <br>You're "Amen" cannot change it. It's the truth.
    <br>God has given you a good destiny.
    <br>You have been given a unique place in God's master plan.
    <br>You have a unique path towards your divine destiny
    <br>and you are in a unique position to make a difference in your world.
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "I have a bright future."
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "I have a good destiny."
    <br>Listen, I don't care what lies satan has whispered to you -
    <br>that you're not good enough, you're not strong enough, you're not smart enough,
    <br>look at your past, your past life is too bad, you can't make it.
    <br>I don't care what society has told you, the restrictions they have placed on you -
    <br>they say because of your gender, because of your age, because of your education,
    <br>because of your family background, you can't make it.
    <br>That's a lie from the pit of hell!
    <br>You have been given a good destiny! Believe it!
    <br>This brings us to one of life's greatest tragedies: unfulfilled destinies.
    <br>Do you know how many people who are destined kings are roaming on the streets today,
    <br>destined leaders who are spending their lives unnoticed, uncelebrated and in obscurity,
    <br>people who are destined to be great but have gone to the grave prematurely?
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "ItÂ´s very painful."
    <br>It's very very painful.
    <br>The truth is, brethren, we all shout, "Amen!" and get excited when we hear we have a good destiny
    <br>but successful people don't just drift to the top.
    <br>We live in a world where the enemy of our souls
    <br>will not just allow the purpose of God, our divine destiny to be fulfilled without putting up a fight.
    <br>He's not going to just let you walk into your destiny without putting up a fight.
    <br>So today, we're going to talk about one of his most important strategies and tactics.
    <br>The easiest way for satan to derail you from your destiny
    <br>is to connect you with people who are not serious about theirs.
    <br>I'm going to say it again.
    <br>The easiest way for satan - our enemy, the enemy of our souls - to derail you from your destiny
    <br>is to connect you with people who are not serious about theirs.
    <br>This will bring us to the title of today's message: "Make friends with your future."
    <br>Tell your neighbor. Say, "Neighbor, make friends with your future".
    <br>Now, let's first of all try and understand what we mean when we talk about relationships.
    <br>We know natural human relationships are very important.
    <br>Everything God created requires a connection:
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are - we need each other.
    <br>God has designed it in this way so that no man should boast.
    <br>We need God but we need good people, inspired people, informed people
    <br>to make it in our respective callings.
    <br>The question is: Who are the type of people that surround you?
    <br>Now, I want to hear from someone in the audience.
    <br>Just feel free to answer this question.
    <br>If you know the answer, just raise up your hand.
    <br>How would you define a friend?
    <br>What is the meaning of real friendship?
    <br>Anyone who would like to answer this question, just raise up your hand.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>My brother here, good.
    <br>How would you define a friend - a true friend?
    <br>A friend is someone who supports you, who shares your dream with you, who walks with you.
    <br>Okay, let's put our hands together for our brother.
    <br>It's a good answer. Anyone else?
    <br>Anyone else from over here wants to explain the meaning of a  friend?
    <br>Okay, madam. Thank you.
    <br>Kind and friendly.
    <br>Okay, someone who is kind and friendly. Fine.
    <br>Anyone else? How would you define a friend?
    <br>A true friend? A good friend?
    <br>Okay, madam. Thank you.
    <br>A friend is someone who is with you during happiness, during problems, when you are sick,
    <br>at every point of time in life when you are in problems, sickness, he is with you,
    <br>he shares with you everything.
    <br>Okay, someone who is with you in both good and hard times, correct?
    <br>Let's open our Bibles because I'm going to read a couple of Scriptures
    <br>that give scriptural basis and understanding of what true friendship is all about.
    <br>The first Scripture we are going to read is in the Book of Proverbs 27.
    <br>So turn with me to Proverbs 27:17.
    <br>And let's see what the Bible says about this very essential and important topic.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Proverbs 27:17.
    <br>And it reads:
    <br>"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."
    <br>Alright. It's in line with the definitions that our brethren have been giving.
    <br>Let's quickly go to Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 and it reads:
    <br>"Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor:
    <br>If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.
    <br>But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up."
    <br>Quickly rush to Galatians 6:2.
    <br>It says:
    <br>"Carry each other's burdens and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ."
    <br>Based on these Scriptures and indeed in line with the answers that our brethren have given,
    <br>we can define friendship in this way:
    <br>A true friend is someone who helps you in your weaknesses and encourages you in your strengths.
    <br>Once again: A true friend is someone who helps you in your weaknesses
    <br>and encourages you in your strengths.
    <br>Now, I want to challenge you today.
    <br>In the light of this definition, examine the people that are close to you -
    <br>that you interact with, that you move with, that you spend time with on a daily basis
    <br>because you are what you are by virtue of the company you keep.
    <br>Say: "Neighbor, you are what you are by virtue of the company you keep".
    <br>We should never underestimate the power of influence.
    <br>Ask yourself: Are the people that you're friends with
    <br>helping you in your weaknesses or using your weaknesses against you?
    <br>Are they people who are having a positive influence on you or a negative influence on you?
    <br>Because a little example has a big influence.
    <br>A couple of years ago, there was a young lady who received deliverance here at The SCOAN.
    <br>She was a Nigerian, her parents were Nigerians
    <br>but she was born and brought up in the UK.
    <br>After her deliverance, we had the opportunity to listen to her life experiences.
    <br>And during the course of sharing her life experiences,
    <br>she said something that shocked me and I want to share it with you.
    <br>She said that at the age of sixteen, she had had two children for two different fathers.
    <br>16 years old.
    <br>When she said this, I was the one to ask the question. I said: "Just can you tell me why?
    <br>At that age, what prompted you to take such a step?"
    <br>Do you know what she replied?
    <br>She said: "Because it was the fashionable thing to do."
    <br>She said: "In my class in school, all of the girls were having kids.
    <br>That was the normal thing.
    <br>That was what you had to do to feel part of the class, the clique."
    <br>I'm not saying this to stand on a high horse, judge and condemn - "How can this person do such a thing?"
    <br>No. I'm trying to tell you the power of influence.
    <br>A young girl taking such a drastic step.
    <br>Just because she wants to feel part of the society.
    <br>She said: "That was the fashionable thing. That was what everyone was doing.
    <br>That was what was happening with her peers and the people in her age group.
    <br>16 years old.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Every relationship you have either nurtures or nourishes a strength or weakness within you.
    <br>Every relationship nourishes a strength or weakness within you.
    <br>Look, as human beings, we all have some dormant character traits.
    <br>When I say dormant, I mean, they are there, but they are unused.
    <br>But these dormant character traits are nourished by the kind of company we keep.
    <br>If you keep company with people that will improve your life,
    <br>the dormant strength in you will be nurtured.
    <br>You keep company with those who will decrease your life,
    <br>the dormant weaknesses, vices in you will be nurtured and the strength will be decreased.
    <br>Who are the people you are moving with, you are close to, you are friends with?
    <br>I want to make an observation and I believe if you examine yourself and examine society,
    <br>you would agree with me.
    <br>Today, it appears that people's weaknesses are what connected them together as friends.
    <br>I'll give an example. I'll try and explain it to you.
    <br>Most of the time, if you see people who are smoking, their friends are smokers.
    <br>Would you agree with me?
    <br>Most of the time, if you see people that are drunkards, their friends are drinking.
    <br>You see people that talk too much - they are friends with people who talk too much.
    <br>Tell me how you will stop talking too much.
    <br>Let's be honest with ourselves.
    <br>Is there anyone here who has the weakness of talking too much?
    <br>If you're honest, just raise your hand.
    <br>Some people are not honest.
    <br>You have the weakness of talking too much.
    <br>Okay, madam, come. Come out.
    <br>Who is another person? You too?  Come.  The second person.
    <br>Some people quickly put their hand down.
    <br>The second person I talked to - okay, madam, come.
    <br>Now, you have a problem. You acknowledge it.
    <br>It's good. Acknowledging your weakness is 50% of the victory.
    <br>Once you can acknowledge you have a problem, the way out has come.
    <br>You acknowledge that you sometimes talk too much.
    <br>Yes, sir, I do.
    <br>Madam, you too. You acknowledge that you talk too much.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, look at this. She talks too much - she talks too much.
    <br>If these two people are friends, tell me how they will stop talking too much.
    <br>It's not possible!
    <br>They are friends. This weakness is meeting this weakness.
    <br>If you add weakness to weakness, you produce more weakness.
    <br>Okay, if you realize that you talk too much,
    <br>who is the kind of person that you should look for as a friend?
    <br>A quiet and more reserved person.
    <br>A quiet and more reserved person so that their strength can help her weakness.
    <br>That is friendship.
    <br>But today, we look for people who have the same weakness as us.
    <br>You are a gossip - you're friends with gossips.
    <br>You have anger issues - you marry someone that has anger issues.
    <br>Tell me why you will not have hypertension.
    <br>You see, you look for people ... it's our weaknesses that connect us with people,
    <br>instead of looking for someone who is strong where you are weak,
    <br>someone who has what you don't have
    <br>so that you can learn from them and they can learn from you and you can become a better person.
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "Make friends with your future."
    <br>Tell your other neighbor: "Make friends with your future."
    <br>Do you know the reason I'm saying you should make friends with your future?
    <br>When you make friends with your future, your future will help you make the right friends.
    <br>You will not start meeting people that are going to end up dividing and subtracting from your life.
    <br>Thank you very much. I appreciate your honesty. You can go back to your seat.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for them.
    <br>They honestly came out. Just look at yourself as an example. Think about the weakness you have.
    <br>Okay, can someone here - just be honest -  someone tell me your weakness. Anyone, just say it.
    <br>Say it out, your weakness. You can shout it out. I will not give you the mic.
    <br>Anger! Thank you, madam. God bless you.
    <br>Madam says she has the problem of anger.
    <br>She's acknowledging that she has a weakness.
    <br>Ask yourself the kind of people that you're close to.
    <br>If your friends, your close friends, your tight pals also have an issue of anger
    <br>and anger meets anger, what you will have is double trouble.
    <br>More anger.
    <br>You have to look for someone that can calm you down.
    <br>Someone that can help you in your weakness.
    <br>There are four types of people in society.
    <br>There are those who add to your life.
    <br>There are those who subtract from your life.
    <br>There those who  multiply your life
    <br>and there are those who divide your life.
    <br>Your relationship with them will make you or mar you.
    <br>Who are the people you are close to?
    <br>Now, let's be honest with ourselves.
    <br>I'm going to do something a little bit crazy.
    <br>Can everyone here stand up? Everyone here.
    <br>Everyone here stand up and come out here.
    <br>Just come here, everyone.
    <br>Come here and face this way.
    <br>Just come out and face here.
    <br>You can move back a bit.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Everyone here.
    <br>You guys, move back a little bit.
    <br>Now in your midst - okay, sir, you can just come.
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "Be sincere."
    <br>It's good that we talk to ourselves.
    <br>It's good so that we can acknowledge where we changed.
    <br>Just turn around, sir.
    <br>I'm going to give you a picture of what is happening in our society.
    <br>We said there are four kinds of people in our society.
    <br>Those you add, those who subtract, those who multiply, those who divide.
    <br>If we are sincere, the majority of people fall into the category of those who subtract and divide.
    <br>As my brother is here alone, you see this crowd of people -
    <br>this large crowd that is coming your direction?
    <br>This crowd of people in the world - we're not talking in the House of God -
    <br>in the world, 99% of them divide and subtract.
    <br>Can you see the danger of following the crowd?
    <br>Can you see the danger of following the majority?
    <br>I'll give you an example to explain this.
    <br>Any time you want to do the wrong thing,
    <br>you will find many people out there to encourage you to do it.
    <br>"Go ahead. Yes. No problem. Go ahead. You can do it.  IÂ´ve done it before, itÂ´s fine."
    <br>Many people will encourage you to do the wrong thing.
    <br>But if you want to do the right thing, it's a struggle; it's a battle.
    <br>People will even advise you against doing it.
    <br>You will never find the time to do what is right but you will easily find the time to do what is wrong.
    <br>This is a picture of society.
    <br>Why then do we so often take the opinion of the majority,
    <br>instead of listening to the testimony of our conscience?
    <br>Everyone here is going to walk forward.
    <br>My brother is going to walk this way.
    <br>When I say stop. I just want you to stop.
    <br>Okay, let's go. Everyone walk, you walk.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Stop!
    <br>Where is my brother?
    <br>I've lost him in here.
    <br>Just raise up your hand, sir.
    <br>Can you identify with this scenario?
    <br>So many times it seems as if the whole world is going this way and we are trying to go the other way.
    <br>And it's the easiest thing in the world to succumb and say: "Let me just join the crowd going this way."
    <br>It's so much easier. It's more convenient. It's more comfortable
    <br>The whole crowd can just go this way.
    <br>But the Bible says: "You are destined to be one with a difference."
    <br>How can you be one with a difference when you follow the majority?
    <br>And you know that the majority, if we're sincere, are heading towards failure.
    <br>You have to take a different direction to achieve a different solution.
    <br>Everyone keep walking. Keep walking.
    <br>Stop!
    <br>This is a picture of how our lives, as people of God should be.
    <br>We donÂ´t follow the majority!
    <br>We don't look to the opinion of others before taking a stand or taking a step.
    <br>We don't do things because people want us to do them, because we want to be popular,
    <br>because we want to be relevant, because we want to be famous.
    <br>We don't look for friends because we want to be part of the society.
    <br>We look for our future and our future will bring the right friends to us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Young people...
    <br>So many young people today go to school, college, university.
    <br>This is a place that is supposed to connect them to their future.
    <br>A place where they are supposed to catch their future.
    <br>But instead, satan catches them.
    <br>Why? Because you go to school, college, university - you want to be part of the crowd.
    <br>You want to be part of the popular group, popular society.
    <br>You do what they do, you go where they go,
    <br>you wear the same clothes they wear, the same makeup they wear.
    <br>And don't be surprised, at the end of the day, your life looks like them - failure!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's put our hands together for everyone!
    <br>You can go back to your seats.
    <br>I'm very sorry. I know you want altar fruits but I can't give everyone altar fruits.
    <br>So we have to give you in the spirit.
    <br>Just receive it by faith because we cannot give everyone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbor, say: "Neighbor, choose your friends with care
    <br>because you will become what they are."
    <br>Once again, I want to challenge you.
    <br>Use this message and examine your life in the light of this message.
    <br>Are you friends with people who are encouraging your strength and helping you in your weaknesses
    <br>or are you moving with people who are taking you back to your past -
    <br>people who have the same problem as you,  the same challenge as you?
    <br>You are depressed and you are moving with someone who is depressed.
    <br>How will you get out of depression?
    <br>You are negative. You have negative opinions of people.
    <br>You always speak negatively, think negatively and talk negatively
    <br>and you are moving with negative people.
    <br>You will continue to be an embodiment of negativity.
    <br>You have to look for people who are strong where you are weak.
    <br>Look for people who have what you don't have.
    <br> Look for your future.
    <br>When I talk about your future, your destiny, I'm referring to God
    <br>because God is the Owner of our destiny; God is the Author of our future.
    <br>There is no other vehicle we can take that will take us to our destiny
    <br>apart from God and His fruit and His Word.
    <br>Love is the vehicle that will take you to your destiny.
    <br>Why then are you friends with people who celebrate hatred?
    <br>Joy is the vehicle that will take you to your destiny.
    <br>Why then are you close to friends, people who are sad all the time
    <br>and look at life from a negative perspective?
    <br>Even when you share an idea with them, they will look down on it, look down on you,
    <br>discourage you, dishearten you and dampen your spirits.
    <br>You say you have the problem of lust or you're part of a whatsapp group
    <br>that is sharing pornographic contents and you download it every day.
    <br>Leave the group if you want to leave that lust.
    <br>Connect to your future.
    <br>The ball is in your court.
    <br>If you make friends with your future, put your future first, value next more than now.
    <br>Don't spoil tomorrow for the sake of today.
    <br>Don't sacrifice your future for the sake of looking good in the present.
    <br>Don't end up becoming just another statistic
    <br>when you were born to be one with a difference - to make a difference in your world.
    <br>As I come to a conclusion of this message, I want to share with you something personal
    <br>that makes this message so much more of a reality for me.
    <br>When I first came to The SCOAN at the age of 13,
    <br>I had the privilege of meeting Prophet T.B. Joshua in his office.
    <br>At that time, I was not so serious about the things of God.
    <br>Yes, I was from a Christian home and loved the things of God
    <br>but I was struggling to balance my Christian life and school, and friends and negative influence.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua greeted me, he said a sentence that I will remember for the rest of my life.
    <br>He looked at me and said, "If you want to follow Jesus, you need to leave your friends".
    <br>I was 13 years old and that single word changed my life.
    <br>Do you know the reason why I say that?
    <br>At that time, the school I was attending was a very good school academically
    <br>but I was the only person who identified himself as a Christian in my class.
    <br>And although, yes, I wasn't rebelling and doing every terrible bad thing
    <br>but I was living a double life: one life at home in a church, another life in school -
    <br>trying to please people, trying to please God.
    <br>And the man of God in a single statement prophetically identified this.
    <br>The next year, I actually had to leave that school and move to a completely different school
    <br>that was a Christian school so that I would be able to fulfill what the man of God said.
    <br>If not for that word, I don't believe I would even be here today
    <br>because the negative influence was so much!
    <br>Why am I saying this example to back up the importance of this message?
    <br>I want to let you know, brethren, that whatever you lose for GodÂ´s sake, you will regain a thousandfold.
    <br>Some of you may be hearing this message and upon sober reflection and self-examination
    <br>realize that there are some people that you need to disconnect from.
    <br>There are some people you need to distance yourself from.
    <br>I want to assure you that if you take that step, you will not regret it.
    <br>Your future is more important than your image.
    <br>Where you are going is more important than just what you are doing now.
    <br>But remember, it's what you are doing that will give birth to where you are going.
    <br>Your destiny must influence your decisions
    <br>for your decisions to take you on the road to your destiny.
    <br>Your destiny does not permit you to move with people
    <br>who waste time on things that have no lasting value and significance;
    <br>people that are only going to discourage you, distract you, dishearten you.
    <br>Be someone that makes a difference in your world by making friends with your future.
    <br>In conclusion.
    <br>In order not to end up like the masses out there who are merely wandering,
    <br>unsure of their dreams and goals, make friends with your future.
    <br>Choose your friends with care.
    <br>Don't just be too quick to trust.
    <br>Don't be too quick to give your heart cheaply to someone
    <br>because you'll just set yourself up for disappointment.
    <br>Don't trade issues with people who are not serious about their future;
    <br>you'll just set yourself up for destruction.
    <br>Don't look for people who have the same weakness as you;
    <br>look for people who are strong where you are weak.
    <br>That is the meaning of true friendship.
    <br>Where you are weak, I am strong.
    <br>Where I am weak, you are strong.
    <br>Iron sharpens iron.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the decision of a champion - a decision that will benefit your future.
    <br>So let your words, your actions, your interactions, your associations, your friends,
    <br>the people you move with - let everything about you become a photograph of the future you desire
    <br>instead of the future you fear.
    <br>Then you will become who God has destined you to be, in Jesus' name.
    <br>May God bless His word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
