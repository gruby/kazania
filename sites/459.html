    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Lemlem Kassa, I am from the USA.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a tumour in my uterus.
    <br>The tumour in my uterus weighed 10 pounds and my legs weighed 28 pounds.
    <br>As you can see here, this was my belly and these were my legs.
    <br>There was fluid in my legs.
    <br>This was my tummy.
    <br>So you mean, what we are seeing on the pictures now
    <br>was your condition when you came to The SCOAN?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you were diagnosed of what problem?
    <br>A tumour in my uterus.
    <br>I had been to five different doctors who said that they had to cut me
    <br>from here to here to remove my uterus and everything.
    <br>I called my brother to pray for me and he said that I needed to go to Nigeria.
    <br>I didn't know anything about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Then, I started watching Emmanuel TV and I saw miracle after miracle after miracle.
    <br>When I came here, I was privileged to meet with the man of God.
    <br>He opened the bottle of Anointing Water, sprayed it on me and prayed for me.
    <br>Then I went back.
    <br>When I checked with the doctor, they could not find the tumour in my uterus.
    <br>They found that it was out from my uterus.
    <br>So you mean, after the ministration of the Anointing Water by the man of God,
    <br>you went back and returned to the hospital for a checkup.
    <br>The doctor found out that the tumour was out of the uterus.
    <br>Correct.
    <br>You said you had a dream. Tell us when you had that dream and what it was about.
    <br>In that dream, the man of God came,
    <br>then he told one of the wise men to give him a razor.
    <br>One of the wise men gave him a razor, then he cut me across here.
    <br>He said there was nothing wrong with my uterus.
    <br>He pulled the whole, huge tumour from my uterus;
    <br>he took it out and threw it away.
    <br>Then, I woke up.
    <br>I went to the doctor and they said, "This is impossible.
    <br>How can it remove automatically?
    <br>This will be easy - we just have to cut it and take it out".
    <br>The same thing that the man of God did in the divine operation
    <br>was happening in the physical.
    <br>As you can see right here, the man of God cut me from here to here.
    <br>This is my uterus, as I told you.
    <br>The tumour was out of my uterus; it was right there.
    <br>Then in this one, this was the huge, big tumour that the man of God took and threw away.
    <br>It was the size of a human head as you can see.
    <br>When I was in recovery, my condition got very bad.
    <br>My blood pressure was 84 over 42 and I started leaking right here.
    <br>Then the man of God came to me in a dream with a designed cup.
    <br>On the cup was written, 'The joy of the Lord is our strength'.
    <br>He then said, "God is good. He's a stronghold to those who are in trouble.
    <br>He knows them, those who trust in Him".
    <br>He then gave me the cup, filled with a thick drink
    <br>and he told me to drink, that everything would be fine.
    <br>I drank it.
    <br>After that, I woke up and my blood pressure was 96 over 62 and the leaking stopped.
    <br>The next day, I was discharged.
    <br>As you see me now, my legs and body are not swollen.
    <br>I am in good health. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus!
    <br>Wow, what God used the Anointing Water to do in her life!
    <br>The swollen tummy as a result of a tumour in the uterus was removed -
    <br>first in the dream by the man of God.
    <br>After the administration of the Anointing Water, she went back to the USA.
    <br>The man of God visited her in the dream, and carried out a spiritual surgery
    <br>and removed the tumour from her uterus.
    <br>After the doctors had tested her, they found out that the tumour was no longer in the uterus.
    <br>They discovered that the operation would now be easier.
    <br>By the time they did the surgery, exactly like what she saw the man of God
    <br>removing from her uterus in the dream, was what the doctor removed physically through surgery.
    <br>That we can see in the pictures on the screen of our television -
    <br>a huge tumour that almost consumed the life of this woman.
    <br>Since then, she is completely free.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Evangelist, were you there when I came to her?
    <br>What a wonderful testimony!
    <br>She came from the USA purposely to share her testimony.
    <br>My advice to all women or anybody going through what I did
    <br>is that, there is hope in the Lord; don't lose hope.
    <br>Doctors can treat but Jesus Christ cures.
    <br>If He can do it for me, He will do it for you. Have faith in God.
    <br>When you received the Anointing Water, how did you minister it?
    <br>Because many don't know how to minister it.
    <br>They think they just have to open the bottle and drink it.
    <br>I took a lot of pictures of women with fibroids from YouTube,
    <br>from the Emmanuel TV testimonies.
    <br>I said, "If He can do it for them, He wil do it for me.
    <br>The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, I have seen You doing miracles - the blind see,
    <br>so many, from A to Z, countless miracles - You will do it for me, in Jesus' name".
    <br>I ministered the Anointing Water with faith and the Lord did it.
    <br>But I am very sure you were praying, not saying words!
    <br>I fasted and prayed.
    <br>We salute your faith. Thank you very much.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
