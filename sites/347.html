    <br>NEVER A DEMON JESUS CANNOT DELIVER!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Legion.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you have seen he is from Sweden.
    <br>Can you see he is manifesting?
    <br>Viewers, whatever is yours,
    <br>whatever demon, elephant,
    <br>whatever name you call it -
    <br>never a demon Jesus cannot deliver.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It is just a touch he received and he became wild.
    <br>Just a touch!
    <br>I told you that our heart is Heaven, if you are for God.
    <br>A touch from Heaven and he became wild.
    <br>Receive a touch, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Leave him.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Leave him.
    <br>He is free.
