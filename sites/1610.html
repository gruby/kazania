    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>My husband.
    <br>OK, give him a kiss.
    <br>YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED IN CHURCH!!! ðŸ˜³â›ªðŸ˜‚
    <br>She was a man.
    <br>Now, she has been converted by Jesus.
    <br>She is now a real woman.
    <br>A wife of Mr Kolawale.
    <br>Tell us what happened to you when you said this man is not your husband.
    <br>Who was with you?
    <br>There was a man in the middle of my husband and me.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The person would sleep between you people.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, the same man - when we were saying, "Contrary spirit, evil spirit" - the man started fighting.
    <br>Yes, we were fighting each other.
    <br>Can you still see the man now?
    <br>No.
    <br>He's gone.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED IN CHURCH!!! ðŸ˜³â›ªðŸ˜‚
    <br>And the man has been following you for how many years now?
    <br>Since you were 10 years old.
    <br>Did you tell this man you were married to a water spirit?
    <br>No, but there was a day we were in Kaduna watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I laid my hands on the screen and I fell down.
    <br>Since then the spiritual husband has been fighting with me.
    <br>Before then, we never used to fight.
    <br>Today, finally the man is gone.
    <br>YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED IN CHURCH!!! ðŸ˜³â›ªðŸ˜‚
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Mrs Folashade Olakunju, I'm from Ondo State.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband, Mr Kolawale Olakunju.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a spiritual husband.
    <br>When the man of God was praying, I just saw the man coming to me.
    <br>He held my hand and asked me to stand up and run away with him.
    <br>The next thing I saw after that was the man of God asking me to kiss my husband.
    <br>That's all I can recall.
    <br>Something came out of my body and my body became light.
    <br>I am free, I thank God.
    <br>Did you tell this man you were married to a water spirit?
    <br>No, but there was a day we were in Kaduna watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I laid my hands on the screen and I fell down.
    <br>Since then the spiritual husband was fighting me,
    <br>saying, "Who asked you to touch the TV screen?" (Emmanuel TV)
    <br>Since then we have not been okay, he has been fighting me.
    <br>That was why I said we must come here today
    <br>because it has been tormenting me and giving me sleepless nights and problems every day.
    <br>If I came in without us having misunderstanding beforehand,
    <br>she would just become wild.
    <br>When she talked to me, I would stay for close to two hours and
    <br>she would be talking to me, in fact, sweating.
    <br>I would just be looking at her because I knew the problem she had.
    <br>That was why I said we must come to The SCOAN.
    <br>On my way here yesterday, in fact, the devil never wanted me to be here but I thank God,
    <br>because the vehicle just stopped for close to five hours.
    <br>We left around 5 o'clock; I said we must be here at all costs today.
    <br>I give God all the glory for what I have seen today
    <br>because when she was being asked who she was,
    <br>she said that she was a king and the spirit inside her said that he would not leave her.
    <br>She was asked who I was and she said that she didn't know,
    <br>and that I was not her husband.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>I don't know him!
    <br>You know this woman.
    <br>I know her; she is my wife.
    <br>He says you are the wife.
    <br>I don't know him; I have my wife.
    <br>Who is he?
    <br>I don't know him!
    <br>You don't know him at all.
    <br>No, I don't know him!
    <br>But the same uniform.
    <br>We have been married for 18 years now.
    <br>Our first son is about to enter university.
    <br>I was surprised when she said I was not her husband.
    <br>The man of God asked me to hug her and in the process of me hugging her, she just fell down.
    <br>When she stood up, she was asked who I was to her.
    <br>It was then she confirmed that I was her husband.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>My husband.
    <br>We have tried so many places - herbal and many places of worship -
    <br>spent a lot of money, but to no avail.
    <br>But today, we spent nothing to receive the deliverance.
    <br>I thank God that I am now the husband; it's all over.
