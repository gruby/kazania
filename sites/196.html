    <br>Stretch your hands
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Every hindrance, be broken, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>You need deliverance.
    <br>Every hindrance to your deliverance, be broken.
    <br>Every one of us needs deliverance.
    <br>When we are delivered, we receive a new life.
    <br>Every hindrance to your deliverance, be broken.
    <br>Bad habits that stand against your deliverance,
    <br>the thoughts that come from your heart that stand against your deliverance -
    <br>God's time is the best; now is God's time.
    <br>Now is God's time!
    <br>Every hindrance that stands against your deliverance, be broken!
    <br>I want to talk to you.
    <br>Talk to me.
    <br>This is one on one.
    <br>Stretch your hand, let's pray together.
    <br>I want to pray for you.
    <br>I say to you prophetically -
    <br>every hindrance standing against your deliverance, be broken!
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Every hindrance standing against your deliverance,
    <br>bad habits standing against your deliverance,
    <br>every obstacle standing against your deliverance,
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>We need deliverance.
    <br>When we are delivered, we are ushered to the grace of God.
    <br>When we are delivered, we are ushered to live by grace, not by law.
    <br>Every hindrance standing against my deliverance,
    <br>in the name of Jesus, be broken!
    <br>Yes. Say, every hindrance!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>You know you need deliverance.
    <br>I can't hear you. Who needs deliverance?
    <br>Who needs deliverance?
    <br>Every hindrance, every obstacle standing against my deliverance,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen to this.
    <br>Whatever hindrance is standing against your deliverance,
    <br>viewers all over the world, whatever hindrance standing against your deliverance,
    <br>viewers all over the world, whatever obstacle standing against your deliverance,
    <br>I command that hindrance, be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, you need deliverance? Who needs deliverance?
    <br>Who needs deliverance?
    <br>Every obstacle, every hindrance
    <br>standing against my deliverance, standing against my blessing,
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>God's time is the best; now is God's time!
    <br>Now is God's time!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Face your neighbour right now.
    <br>Face your neighbour; hold your neighbour's hand.
    <br>Hold your neighbour's two hands.
    <br>Every hindrance standing against your deliverance,
    <br>every obstacle standing against your deliverance,
    <br>standing against your blessing,
    <br>standing against your breakthrough,
    <br>every hindrance standing against your breakthrough,

    <br>every hindrance standing against your breakthrough,
    <br>standing against your healing, be broken in the name of Jesus Christ!
