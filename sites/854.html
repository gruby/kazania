    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Service
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of John 6:63.
    <br>Viewers, I mean those who under the influence of my voice. You are welcome.
    <br>John 6:63.
    <br>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life."
    <br>It means, what you have been hearing since morning here, they are full of spirit and life.
    <br>The testimonies - they are full of spirit and life.
    <br>How does the message appeal to you?
    <br>What do you want to do with the message?
    <br>The message - they are spirit and life.
    <br>This is the Word from Jesus.
    <br>Since God's Word is Spirit, it has ability to quicken us spiritually.
    <br>That is, to speed up, dispatch, to make it happen.
    <br>Quicken us spiritually - it has the ability.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It has the ability to form a spiritual force within our heart -
    <br>ability to form, to develop a spiritual force within our heart or within our spirit.
    <br>Heart means spirit of man,
    <br>since God's Word is Spirit.
    <br>As the Bible says, 'The Words I speak are full of Spirit and life'.
    <br>It means God's Word is Spirit
    <br>and since God's Word is Spirit, it has the ability to develop a spiritual force.
    <br>That is the ability to quicken us spiritually and that spiritual force is within our heart,
    <br>that is, within our spirit.
    <br>It has the ability; I will emphasize on it because it is very important.
    <br>When you now leave here, you want to open your Bible.
    <br>Where is the ability to quicken, ability to develop? It is not here.
    <br>I'm just giving you the meaning of what the Bible says.
    <br>After reading the Bible, I need to examine those words in the light of God's Word.
    <br>There is a lot of literature and histories about God's generals but you need to know what it means.
    <br>God's Word has the ability to develop a spiritual force within our heart or our spirit.
    <br>How does this happen?
    <br>This happens when we pay attention to God's Word.
    <br>When we pay attention to God's Word, we would find that faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>When you pay attention.
    <br>To pay attention, you know what I mean -
    <br>to give all, not like the way you pay attention to your academics,
    <br>history, chemistry, physics and mathematics at school.
    <br>Attention means with all your heart.
    <br>What you have been listening to or hearing since morning can develop a spiritual force
    <br>within your heart called faith.
    <br>When that happens, faith forms.
    <br>When that happens within your heart, spirit, faith forms.
    <br>We call it faith.
    <br>And how does this happen?
    <br>This happens when we pay attention - not this: "Attention!" No, not that.
    <br>That is, I'm talking to you, "pay attention", or the testimonies you hear,
    <br>you examine them and follow them.
    <br>When you find it difficult to pay attention, it means you have to engage in prayer.
    <br>This is why we give you these faith bracelets.
    <br>When you're listening to the Word of God and you find it difficult to pay attention...
    <br>You can find it difficult to pay attention when your heart is divided.
    <br>There is so much conflict - for - against in your heart.
    <br>Your heart will be going up, down, no, no, no, no.
    <br>Then, engage in what?
    <br>Engage in prayer.
    <br>When you engage in prayer, you reset your heart.
    <br>When our heart is not set, we cannot pay attention.
    <br>There are many right now in the church as we are talking whose hearts are going for and against.
    <br>In this case, take your faith bracelet.
    <br>Begin the battle to reset your belief.
    <br>The word 'believing' means to commit ourselves and our things to God,
    <br>and trust Him to accomplish them.
    <br>Believing means committing yourself and your things to God,
    <br>and trusting Him to accomplish them.
    <br>Now talk of faith.
    <br>If believing means committing yourself and your things to God,
    <br>and trusting Him to accomplish them,
    <br>faith also means committing yourself and your things to Someone else -
    <br>wiser, smarter, cleverer, more powerful than you.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The word 'faith' is a trust,
    <br>out of the fact that the other party is honest, reliable and faithful.
    <br>And who is faithful, who is honest?
    <br>As a human being, you cannot be reliable 24/7,
    <br>because, 'In this world, there will be tribulation, dishonesty. Cheer up; I will help you!'
    <br>That is Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you pay attention to God's Word, you will find that faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>These are the reasons why we gave these faith bracelets.
    <br>For faith to come spontaneously, we need to meditate on God's Word,
    <br>and turn it over and over and over again in our hearts.
    <br>For faith to form a spiritual force within our heart - spirit,
    <br>we need to meditate on God's Word and turn it over and over and over again in our hearts.
    <br>The more we meditate and turn it over and over in our heart, the more our spirit acts on God's Word,
    <br>and when our spirit acts on God's Word, it forms faith.
    <br>Faith cannot form without our spirit acting.
    <br>Acts like magnet and nail - when you carry a magnet, it attracts a nail.
    <br>Your spirit must attract the Word to form faith.
    <br>For your spirit, heart to act on God's Word, you need to meditate.
    <br>"Take more of me; give me more of You."
    <br>"Lord, take more of me; give me more of You - more of Your faithfulness, more of Your kindness,
    <br>more of Your humility, more of Your holiness, more of Your goodness."
    <br>Not out this way, meditation means the heart.
    <br>Out of meditation, it is more than and is also above thinking.
    <br>It is the upper house.
    <br>Meditation is the upper house; thinking is lower house.
    <br>When you are thinking, concerning your problems and troubles you have,
    <br>you cannot go into meditation because of your problems.
    <br>It is just thinking; you think, "What will I do now? I am tired of this world.
    <br>I don't know what is wrong with me, no, no, no, I don't know. I am fed up!"
    <br>You are thinking at lower house.
    <br>Meditation is upper house where you will likely, if you are genuine, contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>Thinking - lower house; meditation - upper house.
    <br>We don't think about the Word of God; we meditate about the Word of God.
    <br>We only think about our worries, situations, our friends, loved ones and people around us.
    <br>We think about them but we cannot meditate about them.
    <br>We can only meditate on God's Word, and not think on God's Word.
    <br>Meditation on God's Word is a visit with Him.
    <br>If you want to visit God, just meditate.
    <br>It is a real visit with God.
    <br>The more you meditate on God's Word and turn it over and over and over in your heart,
    <br>the more your spirit acts on the Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To meditate now, this faith bracelet will help you.
    <br>It only helps.
    <br>There are many other means that can also help.
    <br>To pay attention today is so difficult, you need something on the outside to help you.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>Something on the outside to help you.
    <br>When you are inside a vehicle in motion, or inside of a plane.
    <br>You can be reading; at the same time, you fire on.
    <br>You know, I am saying something, while I am talking to you.
    <br>What we are lacking is not greater faith but a greater God.
    <br>That is, what you need is a greater God, not a greater faith.
    <br>We need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
    <br>This is why we often allow testimonies,
    <br>because it is one of the easiest ways to be familiar to God and understand God.
    <br>That testimony, which seems to be so much easier to surrender - testimony.
    <br>The moment you realize that God is reliable, your faith will simultaneously grow.
    <br>In testimonies you see people say, "I had cancer, and I was prayed for",
    <br>then they play for you how the person was prayed for over that cancer.
    <br>Suddenly the person says, "This is my medical report, I'm healed, I am free now.
    <br>Before now, I could not walk, but now I can walk. Before I was blind, but now I can see.
    <br>Before I could not eat, but now I can eat."
    <br>The moment you realize that God is reliable, trustworthy, your faith will simultaneously grow.
    <br>Simultaneously, that is side by side.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You didn't pray before, but after the service you start praying.
    <br>You used to drink before, after the service you say, "No, I'm not going to drink again, God does not like that".
    <br>You are very stingy, the moment somebody says, "Uncle, I don't have money to eat", you say, "Have the money".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Men increase in faith because God has a nature that makes it easy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Men have faith, men increase in faith, because God has a nature that makes it easy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When somebody stands here and says, "I was blind and am able to see",
    <br>you now see the video where the person was led and truly the person was blind.
    <br>Then you will now see the pastor stretching his hand and saying,
    <br>"Be healed in the name of Jesus! Be open in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>and the person says, "I can see!"
    <br>Then the person now comes to testify.
    <br>Men have faith, men increase in faith because God has a nature that makes it easy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the nature of God coming out; the healing is the nature of God and God is the One that heals.
    <br>He is the Healer.
    <br>"Be healed, be restored!"; and they say, "I can see!"
    <br>Now you see a testimony again, you can see, this is healing before and after.
    <br>The moment you realize God is reliable and trustworthy, your faith will simultaneously grow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says in every issue, every matter, there are promises.
    <br>As long as you have faith, God will work for you.
    <br>In every issue, every matter, there are promises in the Bible that as long as you have faith,
    <br>God will work for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So indeed, when you personally examine your life, you will know how much faith you have.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Just examine your life.
    <br>Faith is natural; faith is not something manufactured or produced within.
    <br>In the beginning, I said to you,
    <br>since God's Word is Spirit, it has the ability to develop a spiritual force within our heart or spirit.
    <br>It definitely comes from Baba God.
    <br>Also l remember, I told you here, that in the text which I was trying to educate you more about faith, that
    <br>you have faith, you increase in faith because God has a nature that makes it easy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I have faith, I increase in faith because God has a nature that makes it easy.
    <br>It means faith originates from God.
    <br>Thank you.
