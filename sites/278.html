    278 A LIFE FULL OF CHOICES!! | TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>A Life Full Of Choices
    <br>The Book of 1 Corinthians 10:1-5.
    <br>"Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be unaware that all our fathers
    <br>were under the cloud, all passed through the sea,
    <br>all were baptised into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
    <br>all ate the same spiritual food,
    <br>and all drank the same spiritual drink.
    <br>For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them,
    <br>and that Rock was Christ."
    <br>That is the Rock of Ages.
    <br>I'm taking verse 5 now.
    <br>"But with most of them God was not well pleased,
    <br>for their bodies were scattered in the wilderness."
    <br>Let's go to the proof text - verse 13.
    <br>"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man;
    <br>but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted
    <br>beyond what you are able,
    <br>but with the temptation, will also make the way of escape"
    <br>'With the temptation' is also a blessing - that is what it is saying here.
    <br>"that you may be able to bear it."
    <br>A Life Full Of Choices
    <br>You can choose to walk away from here.
    <br>As I am talking now, you can choose to walk away.
    <br>A Life Full Of Choices
    <br>Viewers all over the world, right in your home,
    <br>you can choose to switch off Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Then, you can also choose to switch it on.
    <br>A Life Full Of Choices
    <br>You can choose to walk away from wrong opportunities.
    <br>You are a free moral agent.
    <br>You can yield to either God or the devil.
    <br>You are a free moral agent.
    <br>Mind you, serving the Lord, our Saviour, is the only road to comfort and peace
    <br>while serving the devil is a sure way to bitterness, pain and death.
    <br>I believe that one of the greatest gifts God has given us
    <br>is the freedom to make decisions.
    <br>You can choose to sleep now as I am talking to you.
    <br>You can choose to stand up.
    <br>You can choose to turn your back to me; you can choose to turn to me.
    <br>All of us who have fallen made a decision
    <br>and all of us who have not fallen faced a similar temptation
    <br>but made a different decision.
    <br>Similar temptation.
    <br>Temptation to do this; temptation to do that.
    <br>Temptation to walk out from wrong opportunities, good opportunities.
    <br>Similar temptation, but made a different decision.
    <br>A LIFE FULL OF CHOICES | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You can choose to let the One who created you, help you.
    <br>Like I have said,
    <br>serving the Lord, our Saviour, is the road to comfort and peace
    <br>while serving the devil, is a sure way to bitterness, pain and death.
    <br>The wisest decision is what you do with Christ.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The wisest decision is what you do with Christ.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[The wisest decision is what you do with Christ.]
    <br>The wisest decision is what you do with Christ.
    <br>Colossians 1:15-16
    <br>"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
    <br>For by Him all things were created that are in Heaven and that are on earth,
    <br>visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.
    <br>All things were created through Him and for Him."
    <br>What are we saying here?
    <br>Jesus created you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Jesus created you.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus created you.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus created you.]
    <br>Jesus created you.
    <br>You can choose to let Him help you in all you do.
    <br>If you rely on the strength of our Saviour,
    <br>He will not allow the enemy of your soul to give you more than you can take.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you rely on the strength of our Saviour,
    <br>He will not allow the enemy of your soul to give you more than you can take."
    <br>He will not allow that.
    <br>He will not allow the enemy of your soul to give you more than you can take.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>He will not allow.
    <br>The way through your fear or failure...
    <br>You have the fear of failure, sickness, this, that, debt - fear, fear, fear.
    <br>The way through your fear of failure or the extreme discouragement
    <br>that comes because you have failed...
    <br>I call it 'extreme'.
    <br>Because of extreme discouragement,
    <br>"Let me go to the club, smoke, drink."
    <br>They started drinking.
    <br>You see them going to the club and you say, "What are you doing here?"
    <br>"Forget about that."
    <br>The extreme discouragement that comes because you have failed,
    <br>turn it around and look at it as a life lesson.
    <br>What lesson?
    <br>What you are going through now,
    <br>many successful people in the society had once passed through them
    <br>before they were promoted to the level they are.
    <br>That is the life lesson.
    <br>Ask Daniel, he will tell you.
    <br>Ask David, he will tell you about weakness.
    <br>Ask Meshack, Shadrach and Abednego,
    <br>they will tell you what they passed through in the furnace.
    <br>We fight through our failures and fear by maximising our forward motion.
    <br>Our warfare is not carnal.
    <br>That is, we pray the more, fast the more.
    <br>The situation I'm talking about
    <br>always prepares true Christians for extraordinary service.
    <br>You fast the more, pray the more, love God the more.
    <br>We fight through our failure.
    <br>What is your fear?
    <br>What is that failure?
    <br>We fight through our situation by maximising our forward motion.
    <br>When discouragement comes, we don't stop; we dig deep and fight it through.
    <br>What could lead to discouragement?
    <br>When you have a problem with your health
    <br>and the doctor is telling you that it is incurable
    <br>and begins to give you examples of people that had the same problem;
    <br>you have counted their number and know that there is no way -
    <br>sooner or later, death.
    <br>"Oh, my God."
    <br>Or when you look at the debts you have or your business has collapsed.
    <br>You look around everywhere.
    <br>You look at your family - limitation in every area.
    <br>You will want to achieve what no one in the family ever has.
    <br>You can see it as a great task.
    <br>If someone has achieved what you are about to achieve in the family,
    <br>you would say, "Wow! Yes, I will achieve it!" but no one has ever achieved it;
    <br>you are just trying to achieve it.
    <br>It means, you will see what no one has ever seen.
    <br>A LIFE FULL OF CHOICES | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>When discouragement comes, we don't stop.
    <br>"Oh, how will I go about it?" - no!
    <br>When fear hits, we speed up the attack.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When fear hits, we speed up the attack.
    <br>The more the trouble, the more you begin to...
    <br>People will see and say, "This man was very fat before but look at him - he is very slim.
    <br>Did you know that he is adding to his fasting and prayer?
    <br>He doesn't eat like before - that kind of food that made him to sleep anyhow.
    <br>Because he wants to pray, fast. The slim stature - maybe he is going to the gym, exercising?"
    <br>No exercising - he speeded up the attack.
    <br>A LIFE FULL OF CHOICES | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Speed up the attack.
    <br>Our attack is not carnal; the weapon is not carnal.
    <br>What is happening to you?
    <br>Why are you lonely?
    <br>Why are you fed up?
    <br>What are you thinking?
    <br>Who knows if your prayer for a better life had been answered,
    <br>what would have happened to you?
    <br>A better life is to buy a beautiful car, to be a president or a senator,
    <br>to build a beautiful house, to have good health.
    <br>And you have been praying for good health.
    <br>That prayer seems not to be answered.
    <br>For everything, there is a purpose as a Christian.
    <br>It may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>It may be to strengthen your desire.
    <br>God will not use pleasure to strengthen your desire
    <br>and God will not use pleasure to keep you for a new level.
    <br>He will not use pleasure to keep you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It is one of these foolish things that are always being used to do that.
    <br>When it comes, you should know you are a Christian;
    <br>you can never be destroyed by any situation.
    <br>A LIFE FULL OF CHOICES | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Your situation is not like others.
    <br>Others are meant to destroy and kill them.
    <br>But your situation is meant to keep you for a new level;
    <br>it's meant to stop you awhile in order to prepare you well, to equip you well.
    <br>It is meant to strengthen your desire.
    <br>It is meant to make you pray the more and fast the more, for extraordinary service.
    <br>That your situation is not like others.
    <br>That your sickness is not like others.
    <br>That your poverty is not like others.
    <br>That your hardship is not like others.
    <br>That, that...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "That is not like others".
    <br>My thorn is not like others.
    <br>That, that... is not like others.
    <br>I am a Christian; it is not like others.
    <br>No condemnation for anyone who belongs to Jesus.
    <br>I belong to Jesus; my sickness is not like others.
    <br>My trouble is not like others.
    <br>A LIFE FULL OF CHOICES | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>That trouble will not come is a false message.
    <br>There will be trouble.
    <br>That sickness will not come - it is a false teaching.
    <br>Sickness will come but yours is not like others.
    <br>When it hits, speed up the attack.
    <br>Dig deep.
    <br>Don't stop!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't stop!"
    <br>Dig deep and fight it through.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When sickness comes, when disease comes,
    <br>when a situation comes, dig deep
    <br>and fight it through.
    <br>Jesus is the answer
    <br>For the world today
    <br>Above Him there is no other
    <br>Jesus is the way
    <br>Jesus is the answer
    <br>For the world today
    <br>Above Him there is no other
    <br>Jesus is the way
    <br>Jesus is the answer
    <br>For the world today
    <br>Above Him there is no other
    <br>Jesus is the way
    <br>Jesus is the answer
    <br>For the world today
    <br>Above Him there is no other
    <br>Jesus is the way
    <br>If you have some questions
    <br>In the corner of your mind
    <br>Traces of discouragement
    <br>And peace you cannot find
    <br>Reflection of the old past
    <br>That seems to face you every day
    <br>But there is one thing I know for sure
    <br>Jesus is the way
    <br>Jesus is the answer
    <br>For the world today
    <br>Above Him there is no other
    <br>Jesus is the way
    <br>Jesus is the answer
    <br>For the world today
    <br>Above Him there is no other
    <br>Jesus is the way
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>A Life Full of Choices
    <br>Take note, there are some bitter words there.
    <br>Those discouragements...
    <br>Why are you down? Because of discouragement.
    <br>You have been in this marriage, with this man for so long, given him all your love
    <br>but at the end of the day they carry your property - throw it out.
    <br>Or you man, a woman has disappointed you so much,
    <br>after you have given her all your love and everything you needed to do.
    <br>Or your business - you have served this company so long and it is time to reward you;
    <br>now, it is the opposite.
    <br>Or your health.
    <br>You know you live according to the Scripture but remember,
    <br>it is only God who does the work of righteousness.
    <br>But your health fails you.
    <br>This brings about discouragement.
    <br>Your career, after you have studied so much; you have a certificate -
    <br>those who don't have it are in places - but you, there is no way.
    <br>You keep looking for a job everywhere.
    <br>People interviewing you for jobs are your students.
    <br>Each time you are called for an interview,
    <br>you will see those who are interviewing you were your juniors at school.
    <br>They will say, "Oh, Oga (Boss). What can I do for you?"
    <br>But he cannot help you because he is not the only person in the panel; there are many.
    <br>Everyone has their own interest. He can only say, "Oga (Boss)".
    <br>So, you keep going...
    <br>Remember, when discouragement comes, dig deeper and don't stop.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't stop, dig deep and fight it through!"
    <br>Yes, as a Christian.
    <br>It is not the time to relax and become discouraged.
    <br>Don't allow discouragement.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>The Bible says, "Cheer up; I have overcome the world".
    <br>He is telling you He has overcome the world.
    <br>That is, He gives you the strength to overcome whatever comes.
    <br>That is what He says.
    <br>He says, you that live in the world, as a Christian,
    <br>I have given you strength to face any situation.
    <br>Dig deep; fight it through.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You don't have to worry
    <br>And don't you be afraid
    <br>Joy comes in the morning
    <br>Troubles they don't last always
    <br>For there's a Friend named Jesus
    <br>Who will wipe your tears away
    <br>And if your heart is broken
    <br>Just lift your hands and say
    <br>I know that I can make it
    <br>I know that I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>You don't have to worry
    <br>And don't you be afraid
    <br>Joy comes in the morning
    <br>Troubles they don't last always
    <br>Remember there's a Friend named Jesus
    <br>Who will wipe your tears away
    <br>And if your heart is broken
    <br>Just lift your hands and say
    <br>I know that I can make it
    <br>I know that I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>I know that I can make it
    <br>I know that I can stand

    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>You don't have to worry
    <br>And don't you be afraid
    <br>Joy comes in the morning
    <br>Troubles they don't last always
    <br>For there's a Friend named Jesus
    <br>Who will wipe your tears away
    <br>And if your heart is broken
    <br>Just lift your hands and say
    <br>I know that I can make it
    <br>I know that I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>With Jesus I can make it
    <br>With Him I know I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
