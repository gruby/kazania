    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>You don't know how it will happen but you know it will be over today.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I don't know how it will happen but it will be over today."
    <br>My trouble, my situation - it will be over today!
    <br>I don't know how it will happen - it will be over today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you have sung one song, which you are still singing - it says...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So that is light and darkness.
    <br>You know your situation is darkness.
    <br>That trouble is darkness.
    <br>That situation is darkness.
    <br>And this is light.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Let me remind you, because I am very sure you will not go the same.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I want to remind you again about maintenance;
    <br>how the blessing you are about to receive will remain
    <br>because it is very very important.
    <br>Because out there is darkness and now you are a channel of light.
    <br>You are a channel of shining light.
    <br>How this will remain - the breakthrough you are about to receive,
    <br>healing, blessing, salvation - how they will remain?
    <br>That you will not receive it - forget about that.
    <br>The supply is more than the demand.
    <br>The anointing is in the house.
    <br>Whatever I am going to say should remove your situation.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>So let's remind ourselves about maintenance, what we talked about today.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The Holy Spirit wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>This means, to be ungrieved.
    <br>He does not want to remain when He is grieved.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>He does not want to remain when He is grieved.
    <br>How can we grieve the Holy Spirit?
    <br>By our pride.
    <br>And I told you; when you talk of pride:
    <br>Our pride is expressed in various ways.
    <br>God is the only One - He is not to be compared.
    <br>"Wait for me, I want to pray. Wait for me" - why should anybody wait for you when you want to pray?
    <br>How do you know when you will leave the prayer,
    <br>when the Holy Spirit is the One leading you to pray?
    <br>Already - it is like you are the one leading the prayer,
    <br>if you are saying, "Uncle, please wait for me. I am coming. I want to pray."
    <br>It means you are the one leading yourself and the Holy Spirit is the One
    <br>teaching us how to pray.
    <br>That has nullified our prayer.
    <br>And I told you here:
    <br>When you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is, grieved God.
    <br>Grudges, that is hatred, unforgiving spirit.
    <br>Somebody has cheated you, embarrassed you - there are many...
    <br>If you go round, you see nearly everybody here has one or two things
    <br>that they are nursing in their hearts against their brothers and sisters.
    <br>Everyone has one or two things they are nursing.
    <br>If you don't have anything you are nursing against a brother or sister,
    <br>I am very sure you have something against a mosquito!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So how can our spirit be free?
    <br>If our spirit is not free, the Spirit of God cannot remain.
    <br>He cannot even come.
    <br>This is why He comes and does not remain.
    <br>Blessing comes but does not remain long.
    <br>Healing comes but does not remain long.
    <br>Deliverance comes but does not remain because of holding a grudge.
    <br>It is better not to receive than to receive and lose it.
    <br>It is better not to be a rich man at all, than to be a rich man and after a year become poor.
    <br>This is the situation we are facing now.
    <br>Before we start this prayer...
    <br>Look at T.B. Joshua you are seeing today.
    <br>If the blessing of God did not remain in my life, it would not even grow.
    <br>When something doesn't remain, it cannot grow.
    <br>It means it remained - that is why it grows.
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>You would not be here today, if that blessing did not remain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the face of persecution, it remained, because I am not giving attention to persecution.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "In the face of persecution blessing remains,
    <br>because I am not giving attention to persecution."
    <br>But you, in the face of persecution - blessing goes away,
    <br>because you give attention to persecution.
    <br>When they are persecuting you, you would reply...
    <br>At the same time the mouth you are using to say, "You are stupid",
    <br>you cannot be saying, "You are good".
    <br>You can't say those two things at the same time.
    <br>You choose to say, "You are stupid" when you are fighting.
    <br>At the same time you cannot reconcile.
    <br>You finish fighting and come back to reconciliation.
    <br>This is what we are facing today.
    <br>If you are annoyed, you cannot at the same time be happy.
    <br>When you are happy, you cannot at the same time be annoyed.
    <br>It is one you must choose.
    <br>If I have given attention to persecution,
    <br>the blessing will not remain, talk less of grow.
    <br>If I am giving attention to the hatred of people towards me,
    <br>the blessing of God will not even remain, talk less of growing.
    <br>But you give attention to persecution.
    <br>That is why you lose that blessing.
    <br>You always fight, you are ready to fight.
    <br>You answer anybody who accuses you.
    <br>You are ready to defend yourself.
    <br>You are ready to prove that you are right.
    <br>All your proofs to be right - where is it taking you to?
    <br>What have you gained from your proofs that you are very intelligent and right?
    <br>Leave it for God, don't worry yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You have been giving attention to persecution.
    <br>That is why the blessings are not remaining."
    <br>So, ignore!
    <br>If you are called, it will make you fit.
    <br>You say you are called, a child of God.
    <br>If truly you are a child of God, God will make you fit for that position you occupy.
    <br>Let them persecute you, it will make you fit for the battle.
    <br>Don't fight, leave the battle for God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What are we saying?
    <br>We are not saying that you fight physically.
    <br>Many of you, when trouble comes, you are disturbed
    <br>and the moment you are disturbed, there is nowhere for the Holy Spirit to stay.
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot stay in a disturbed heart, a disturbed mind.
    <br>The moment you are disturbed, you lose God; you are out of God.
    <br>The moment you are worried, "How does it happen to me? Oh my God." - you are not of God.
    <br>The moment you are disturbed and worried
    <br>over persecution, attack of enemy, over what they are doing to you, trouble, challenges you have,
    <br>and you are worried - at that moment you are absent of God.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Off and on you have God.
    <br>The Holy Spirit today, evil spirit tomorrow.
    <br>There is no vacuum - if your heart is not of God, it is of satan.
    <br>This is what satan is using to get you; when you are happy,
    <br>he would want something that can make you worry
    <br>because if you are worried, you are absent of God - it occupies you.
    <br>Don't allow yourself at any moment there is worry...
    <br>Worry will come.
    <br>In this world, no one can live without worry; there must be worry but don't allow it to stay.
    <br>Don't feed on it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There will be worry; don't feed on it!"
    <br>Worry will come to us as human beings but don't feed on it.
    <br>Holding a grudge against your brother;
    <br>hatred, resentment or whatever,
    <br>whether you are right or wrong, you are the one losing as a Christian.
    <br>"Ah! They cheated me. I will not agree. I am ready to fight the battle." -
    <br>you are the one losing spiritually.
    <br>Physically you may win that case, but spiritually you are losing.
    <br>You have nothing to gain in fighting back.
    <br>Leave it for God.
    <br>So, please...
    <br>Now, it is time for a prayer.
    <br>The Holy Spirit will come, let Him remain.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let Him remain."
    <br>He needs to be allowed
    <br>to be Himself in us.
    <br>He needs to be allowed to be Himself in us.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are here, you listen to what we are saying.
    <br>He wants to be Himself in us, in you,
    <br>that is, to be ungrieved.
    <br>Holding a grudge against your brother - you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You should not be surprised if the Bible is not real any longer.
    <br>You will be reading the Bible, while holing an offence -
    <br>you will read the Bible but you are reading books, literature; it cannot affect your life.
    <br>It is just history you are reading, if you hold offence and you are reading the Bible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Holding offence and reading the Bible - you are reading history."
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Holding offence and reading the Bible - you are reading history.]
    <br>Holding offence against your brother and reading the Bible - you are reading history,
    <br>you are reading literature, chemistry, physics, biology.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is simple.
    <br>Holding offence against your brother and reading the Bible - you are reading ordinary books,
    <br>which cannot affect you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Offence off all kinds.
    <br>Somebody came and slapped you unjustly.
    <br>"What have I done? Why did this happen to me?"
    <br>Please, don't hold offence - this is what satan wants.
    <br>He wants to remove you from your position.
    <br>When you are disturbed spiritually, you cannot pray - whom are you praying to?
    <br>You cannot pray to God while you are disturbed;
    <br>you can't read the Bible, you are reading literature.
    <br>You can't fast, you can't do anything, you don't have a relationship any longer.
    <br>You have been reading your Bible - the wonderful book;
    <br>the only book that would have changed your life.
    <br>Because you hold offence while reading - the Bible cannot change you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no way you can meditate on what you read and turn it over and over again in your heart,
    <br>when you hold an offence.
    <br>And you need to meditate on what you read and turn it over and over again in your heart,
    <br>to pound it over and over.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I pray your heart receives this message.
    <br>Take note, this is a decision.
    <br>This is a question of the heart.
    <br>In your heart, whom do you trust?
    <br>Prayer is a question of the heart.
    <br>In your heart, who do you trust now?
    <br>Who you trust will save you.
    <br>Receive a hearing heart!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I command you to receive a hearing heart!
    <br>Receive a hearing heart, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>We Christians believe satan is behind our situation.
    <br>We Christians believe satan is responsible for our situation.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>We Christians believe satan is behind our situation,
    <br>he is responsible for our situation.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to bring you to his relationship -
    <br>begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to bring you to his relationship -
    <br>begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>whatever satan might have used to bring you to his relationship -
    <br>you are a child of God.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to bring you to his relationship -
    <br>begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Satan uses our weakness to make us a disciple.
    <br>When you being to do the work of satan - that is a relationship,
    <br>that is being a disciple of satan.
    <br>When you know what you are doing is not of God, you have become a disciple of satan.
    <br>If what you are saying is not of God, definitely you are in relation with satan.
    <br>You realise, "What I am saying is not of God" - you are in a relationship with satan,
    <br>you are a disciple, his agent.
    <br>He uses our weaknesses to connect us to himself, to make us an agent, disciples.
    <br>Right now, whatever satan is using
    <br>to bring you to relationship - begin to disconnect yourself right now.
    <br>Disconnect yourself right now, disconnect yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, satan uses our situation and weaknesses to bring us to his relationship,
    <br>to connect us to himself and to make us an agent.
    <br>Whatever satan is using to connect you to himself, begin to disconnect yourself right now.
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>You have no power of your own.
    <br>Viewers, you depend on the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every infirmity in your organ, sickness or disease that torments you or gives you pain or nightmares,
    <br>leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You, infirmity, leave my people!
    <br>You, sickness and disease, leave my people!
    <br>Never a sickness or disease Jesus cannot heal or cure.
    <br>I say, "Be cured, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Wherever it is located in your body, be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever name it is called, whether deadly or not - be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Are you in a coma and your people are crying around you?
    <br>Be restored!
    <br>I can see you being restored!
    <br>I can see you being revived!
    <br>You are revived!
    <br>Revival!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, I can see you being healed!
    <br>Begin to prepare your spirit right now for joy and happiness because I am seeing you testifying.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>That sickness or disease in your organ - I command you out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Still back to what we have talked about; holding grudges against our brother.
    <br>When you hold a grudge against your brother,
    <br>automatically you are an agent of satan.
    <br>These are the instruments satan uses.
    <br>You say, "I am right. Why should this man do this to me? He is wrong."
    <br>And you are now holding a grudge against him.
    <br>You say, "I will make sure I prove my case."
    <br>Indeed, you prove your case, you are right but spiritually it is not good for you.
    <br>Because Jesus is looking for a free spirit to get connected, to join Himself.
    <br>If your spirit is not free, you are not of Him, He can't use you.
    <br>He doesn't want to be a tenant.
    <br>He wants to be Landlord.
    <br>He wants to be the head.
    <br>He doesn't want to share an apartment, your heart.
    <br>While there is hatred in your heart, love in your heart is not possible.
    <br>These two cannot live together; love and hatred.
    <br>You cannot manifest these two things in your heart; hatred and love.
    <br>They say the man has hatred and love at the same time - no, it is not possible.
    <br>Jesus wants to be the Landlord, He wants to take over the all, not to share.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every satanic connection in your heart - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever that is difficult to go, in your heart, -
    <br>go, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let go, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your heart is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Whatever that refuses to go in your heart -
    <br>I say, let go, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Free for God, free for the Holy Spirit!
    <br>Holy Spirit!
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>Open your heart.
    <br>You will be surprised to see what will happen to you today.
    <br>I say you will be astonished to see what will happen today.
    <br>You will be astonished.
    <br>You will be surprised to see the outcome.
    <br>I told you at the beginning that you would not know how it would happen
    <br>but you'll know the end has come.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The end has come for stiff opposition.
    <br>I say, stiff opposition.
    <br>There are certain situations that you have been battling with.
    <br>It could be weakness.
    <br>You say, "This weakness - I don't want it."
    <br>But the more you pray, the more it increases.
    <br>There are certain things that disturb your life, disturb you all through.
    <br>We call it 'stiff opposition'.
    <br>You stiff opposition, I say leave my people.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When Jesus says 'yes'
    <br>[nobody can say 'no'.]
    <br>Say 'yes' to my heart.
    <br>Welcome to Jesus!
    <br>Say 'yes'!
    <br>We need to deal with your heart before we ask for blessing from God.
    <br>Because if these blessings come, you can be able to maintain them.
    <br>It is of no use receiving blessing without maintenance.
    <br>It is better if it is permanent.
    <br>Yes. This is why we are to talk about the heart.
    <br>This heart of yours - some of us are here today;
    <br>you say you have received Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, you look like a Christian,
    <br>but after the closing hour, you go the backyard, you begin to smoke,
    <br>there is nothing you would not do.
    <br>Within a second, you have forgotten what you have done here.
    <br>I say to you, "Your heart - reject this."
    <br>Everything I reject - my heart reject!
    <br>You know, you don't have control over your heart.
    <br>Many a time you say, "This thing - I hate it" but your heart still admires it.
    <br>Many a time you say, "This thing - I hate it" but your heart will yearn for it.
    <br>You don't have control over your heart.
    <br>You say, "No, I don't want this. I am a Christian." but your heart will continue to yearn for it.
    <br>What kind of Christian is this? It is very frustrating when you don't have control over yourself;
    <br>what you hate you do, what you don't want to do you do...
    <br>For how long will this continue?
    <br>After you finish doing them, you begin to murmur, you feel worried,
    <br>"I am a Christian. Why should all this be happening to me?
    <br>Why should I continue to do this?"
    <br>I am telling you; your heart reject it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever I reject, my heart agree!
    <br>Whatever I reject, my heart concur, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I want you to leave here today and begin to hate everything that is not of God.
    <br>You just move like this, "No. I just feel I don't want it again."
    <br>Some of your friends will give you a call and say, "Brother, I want to see you."
    <br>"No. You want to see me where? I can't come there again."
    <br>You just find yourself beginning to hate what Jesus doesn't like.
    <br>You find yourself not wanting to go where Jesus is not welcomed.
    <br>Your heart - reject, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Everything that stands for Jesus, your heart love, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Say, "My heart has surrendered!"
    <br>Yes, indeed it has surrendered.
    <br>Yes, we can proceed now.
    <br>Every familiar spirit, whatever familiar spirits might have done...
    <br>Because they have done so much to bring you to this level.
    <br>Sometimes, when you sit down and ask yourself, "I labour.
    <br>Why has all this happened?"
    <br>Familiar spirits have done so much.
    <br>Whatever familiar spirits must have done in your life -
    <br>begin to be repaired, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be rebuilt, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rise again, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your business, rise again, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your finances, rise again, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your family, rise again, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You, familiar spirit!
    <br>Command them out of your life!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>I am the woman in the house.
    <br>Do you know? I possess...
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>With all their sicknesses and disease...
    <br>Whatever you must have eaten on the table of your enemy,
    <br>whatever you must have eaten in your dream,
    <br>begin to bring it out and command it out right now!
    <br>Command them out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am in the house.
    <br>I want to kill her.
    <br>She will not share my son with me.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Do you know this limitation you are facing, challenges you are facing...
    <br>Sometimes, when you ask yourself,
    <br>"I speed up and at the same time I slow down and I don't know".
    <br>How can somebody be at speed and the result is 'slow'?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How can you be at speed and the result is slow?"
    <br>This word is 'pregnant'.
    <br>You work hard with all your might but have nothing to show.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In your career, you speed - the result is slow.
    <br>In your marriage, you speed - the result is slow.
    <br>I will not say the result is nothing - it is slow.
    <br>You know you are speeding, you know you are working hard,
    <br>you know it is not a result of your hard working,
    <br>if you know the result you worked for.
    <br>This is what we are talking about.
    <br>Whatever that is the cause...
    <br>Your nightmares - all are from satan.
    <br>Command satan and all his evil, work, limitation, frustration!
    <br>Command them!
    <br>You, satan, I say to you - leave my people!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>- Who are you?
    <br>- Spiritual husband!
    <br>- Who else?
    <br>- Snake.
    <br>I destroyed her career.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Everything within and outside that connects with satan - be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>There can be no nightmare without connection.
    <br>There must be connection with satan for you to have nightmare
    <br>and each nightmare has implications,
    <br>and each nightmare gives setback,
    <br>each nightmare slows you down.
    <br>Everything within and outside that connects with satan - be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever poison, within and outside of your system -
    <br>in your blood, kidney, liver, fluid, bones and all your organs -
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every infirmity, leave my people!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to rebuke every infirmity and sickness in your body!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How are you feeling?
    <br>How are you doing?"
    <br>How are you doing?
    <br>It is not about how you are doing; it is about Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am a legion!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes. I still want to pray with you concerning every pain satan might have hidden,
    <br>that is tormenting you.
    <br>Some will say there is a cat that comes to the house at a certain time,
    <br>some will say 'spider's webs', some will say 'nightmare',
    <br>each time they eat or each time they fall in the dream - the business collapses.
    <br>A lot of stories.
    <br>These are the stigmas.
    <br>Satan, you are exposed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are exposed!
    <br>Whatever you might have been using to torment my people, cause them setback,
    <br>sickness, disunity in marriage and with business partners, I command you out right now!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever that is causing you nightmares -
    <br>your blood, fluid, kidney, system, business, finances, marriage, career -
    <br>right now, open your lips and begin to rebuke them out!
    <br>"You caused me nightmare!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>- Who are you?
    <br>- She is not going to school!
    <br>62!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to pray with you and I know with what you have seen, you will believe my prayer.
    <br>You will believe that what I am about to say is not mine.
    <br>What I am about to say is not mine.
    <br>Let us start from the health.
    <br>Whatever in your system that is giving you nightmare...
    <br>You know when something is giving one nightmare, it means pain and discomfort.
    <br>Whatever sickness, disease or infirmity, wherever it is located,
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, whatever that is giving you nightmares, wherever it is located in your health or organs,
    <br>leave my people!
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>That sickness and disease - leave my people!
    <br>Don't leave without testimony.
    <br>Listen to me, that is the voice of God.
    <br>Because you have a testimony, and yet you want to go home with it.
    <br>That can threaten the Spirit of God remaining in you.
    <br>It nullifies, disqualifies all the efforts to have God.
    <br>I can see you giving testimony!
    <br>I am seeing you giving testimony of your good health!
    <br>I want to congratulate you.
    <br>I am in the midst of healed people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Right now, remember your country in prayer.
    <br>Wave your flag or whatever you have as a contact.
    <br>Pray for your leader.
    <br>Ask God to release your nation from the spirit of corruption.
    <br>Release my nation from the spirit of adultery, poverty, killing, stealing and destruction.
    <br>Lord Jesus, release my nation from the spirit of misjudgement, misuse, misrule,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We have some people here that are coming for the first time.
    <br>This is your first relationship with Jesus - I want to strengthen you.
    <br>Open your lips right now and say after me:
    <br>Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. Come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me a channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Make me a channel of obedience where there is disobedience.
    <br>Make me a channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me a channel of humility where there is pride.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Let the people of God say 'Amen'!
    <br>And I want to pray with you once again,
    <br>the Lord should continue to strengthen you, standing for Him,
    <br>because you need to be strengthened to stand for Jesus,
    <br>because out there is darkness and it is so tough.
    <br>I pray you will be strengthened, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name!
