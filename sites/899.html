  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Lucy Atim Hansen.
    <br>I'm originally Ugandan, living in Norway.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was suicidal thoughts and different sorts of pain.
    <br>This all started when I was young.
    <br>When I was a little girl, I was about 2 and a half years old, I had my little sister,
    <br>my mum and my dad; we were four in the house.
    <br>One day, when I was 2 and a half years old, I remember I was sitting with my little sister
    <br>in the living room, playing and my dad was sitting and reading the newspaper.
    <br>My mum came from work, parked her car in the garage and passed through the kitchen.
    <br>From the kitchen, she came through the corridor with a gallon of paraffin.
    <br>I run after her and she told me to go and play with my little sister.
    <br>I went back and sat down and she went down the corridor to her bedroom.
    <br>A few minutes later, I saw smoke coming from the corridor.
    <br>I told my dad that there was smoke in the house but as a child, he didn’t take me seriously
    <br>and just said I should continue playing, that my mum was coming soon.
    <br>The next thing I knew was a scream that I can never forget because
    <br>I was such a little girl and I had never heard anyone scream like that before.
    <br>Those who were outside had already seen the fire through the roof.
    <br>The fire brigade came, the ambulance came and a neighbour came and carried us.
    <br>The biggest mistake she did was to stand there with us because she was curious to see.
    <br>They brought her out of the house; she didn’t have any skin left
    <br>but she was alive, screaming, “John, if I don’t make it, take care of my kids.”
    <br>They took her to hospital and two days later, they took us to see her at the hospital.
    <br>The only thing I knew was to listen to her voice talking, telling us that everything would be OK
    <br>but she was covered in something that I could not see her.
    <br>That was the last time I saw her.
    <br>Two days later, she died and life turned around.
    <br>After my mum died, we moved from that house to another house.
    <br>As a child, I remember that after 6 or 7 months, my dad married a new woman in the house.
    <br>Life became harder and it wasn’t only her that I suffered the rejection and abuse from.
    <br>The whole family rejected us as if the death of our mother was our fault.
    <br>Then, when I was eight years old, I couldn’t take the pain so I ran away from home.
    <br>I went to the missionaries and started working as a dish washer to survive.
    <br>I left my little sister behind and two years after, she died.
    <br>Then it was me and my dad.
    <br>My dad never cared much.
    <br>Maybe he cared but he was scared of people around him.
    <br>I had been accused of each and every thing – that I was a thief, I was the ugly one.
    <br>There is no name in this world that I didn’t get called – different types of names,
    <br>which made me grow up thinking that I was the ugliest child in the world, a thief and a killer.
    <br>With that rejection, I moved on.
    <br>I never went home again.
    <br>From there, I started my own life by working hard.
    <br>I had children after being raped many times.
    <br>I was only four years old and I was raped by a grown up man.
    <br>I couldn’t say it to anybody.
    <br>I lived in the pain and I moved in it
    <br>until my auntie, a friend came with her husband from Norway and he said he wanted to adopt me.
    <br>Sorry, our sister, it is quite a terrible situation and experience;
    <br>before you go any further - could you just tell us, the death of your mum,
    <br>the encounter you had after your father married a new wife,
    <br>and when you were 8 years old, your younger sister died as well -
    <br>with all these terrible circumstances, what happened to you at the end of the day?
    <br>It affected my life mentally – with all this stress and torture, no respect, nobody liked me.
    <br>I developed headaches and could go with these headaches for three months non-stop.
    <br>I didn’t eat and go to the toilet normally.
    <br>I could go for three weeks without going to the toilet.
    <br>I didn’t go to the toilet unless I took tablets.
    <br>Suddenly they said I had a heart problem.
    <br>They took me everywhere, for MRIs I don’t know how many times.
    <br>I had depression and was admitted to hospital and locked up because they said I was crazy.
    <br>There was no treatment and they found a lot of sicknesses in me every day.
    <br>I had migraines every month.
    <br>Even last month, I suffered from migraines.
    <br>I had 40 bottox injections to cool my migraines down.
    <br>I could go for months, day and night.
    <br>When I went to Norway, everything went OK.
    <br>I started to go to school.
    <br>I started to learn very fast.
    <br>I started to get a small job and was working, going to school and earning my pocket money.
    <br>Then, suddenly, my aunt divorced.
    <br>When they were going through the divorce and separation, she left and I had to go with her.
    <br>During that time, I thought I was safe but I wasn’t.
    <br>Mrs Lucy Atim Hansen
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>It is indeed a pathetic situation.
    <br>We believe it is all cause for joy, because the end is sweet.
    <br>We know all your suffering, pain and agony have come to an end.
    <br>I'm sorry.
    <br>People of God, I wasn't safe.
    <br>I would be at home and suddenly, my aunt would come back home with a guest.
    <br>And that ‘guest’ was a terrible experience for me.
    <br>I would be sent to ‘serve’ that person, whether I wanted it or not.
    <br>Now, think about it – men that you don’t know that it’s going to happen but it will happen.
    <br>It indeed happened – four to five times; it was terrible.
    <br>That is why I said that all my life I had been raped, rejected and felt like nothing.
    <br>These are the things that have been in my mind that I’m ugly and completely nothing.
    <br>Among those men who came to me, there was a man who God helped me through.
    <br>He saw the pain in me and said, “I don’t understand; what is this?
    <br>You are crying and in pieces, what is wrong?
    <br>I know you don’t want to do this; I can’t do this. I don’t have the heart; I cannot do it.
    <br>Don’t be scared of me, I’m going to help you. You are in pain; I can see it and feel it.
    <br>Don’t be scared; I won’t hurt you.”
    <br>That was how he talked to me and said that he would help me.
    <br>The man called my uncle and told him, “If this girl gets killed or falls into problems, as her father,
    <br>you will be responsible for it. Come here and let me tell you what is going on.”
    <br>So, they met and after the meeting,
    <br>the man said he was going to pay for an apartment for me, for two years.
    <br>Indeed, he found an apartment for me, I moved in and he paid for the apartment.
    <br>He did it like as a father would; he helped in different ways.
    <br>He said it was too painful the day he saw me; he wanted to see me happy and
    <br>he was ready to stand and protect me if anything happened to me, which he did.
    <br>I started going to school from my apartment, I found a job and was working part-time.
    <br>I took a hair dressing course.
    <br>About six to seven months later, I was working together with my neighbour’s wife;
    <br>we became friends, the woman was Danish.
    <br>My husband had grown up together with her husband but he lived far away in a village.
    <br>He came to visit my neighbours and I was there grilling together with the lady I worked with.
    <br>So, we met but we didn’t exchange contact details at once.
    <br>For about a year, we would talk now and again as he lived far away.
    <br>After that year, things became serious and he told me that he wanted to marry me.
    <br>I didn’t trust him but he said I should trust him
    <br>and that meeting me was the best thing that happened to him.
    <br>He said I was ‘over kind’.
    <br>I said, “OK but I don’t know if your family will accept me because I am dark skinned”.
    <br>He said, “If they love me, they will love you and if they don’t love me, they will reject you.
    <br>And if they reject you, they reject me too.”
    <br>OK, you mean it was in the house of that Danish friend where you met with your current husband.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK
    <br>Before you go any further from there, could you just tell us...
    <br>You made us to understand that right from the age of 4, you were abused to the age of 15 by unknown men.
    <br>Could you tell us what was the consequence of this abuse?
    <br>The abuse happened in different ways.
    <br>Back home, from 13 years old, I had a baby boy.
    <br>Before I was 14 years old, I had another one.
    <br>By the age of 15-16 years old, I had three children.
    <br>I was 16 and these children till now, are back home.
    <br>Then, you were not married.
    <br>I was not married.
    <br>I moved in with my husband and we have been together now for 16 years.
    <br>We have a girl together.
    <br>Could you tell us; in the course of these terrible experiences -
    <br>was there anything you were addicted to?
    <br>When I was 10 years old, I started to smoke and I became addicted to smoking.
    <br>I could smoke more than 40 cigarettes a day.
    <br>Finally, with me being sick here and there, at times, I would want to run away from home.
    <br>Whenever I saw lots of snow, I wanted to run and bury my head inside it.
    <br>I would go crazy in the house.
    <br>My husband did everything he could and I would tell him every day
    <br>that it was not material things that I wanted but rather my freedom.
    <br>I told him that I was not free, that I was in pain.
    <br>Then one day, while on YouTube, I suddenly came across Emmanuel TV
    <br>where I was surprised to see a lot of people being delivered.
    <br>I said, "My God".
    <br>I saw people in situations like mine and worse
    <br>and said to myself that this man would be the one to take me out of my pain,
    <br>that I had to look for him.
    <br>Mrs Lucy Atim Hansen
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>From that day, I started to watch Emmanuel TV every single day.
    <br>I could sit and watch it for the whole day.
    <br>My husband would travel a lot.
    <br>When he was not at home, I would not go to the bedroom; I would sleep in the living room.
    <br>We don’t have Emmanuel TV but I would watch it through YouTube.
    <br>I would sit and watch it the whole night and day.
    <br>My husband and children would tell me, “You with this TV – you are going crazy”.
    <br>Even the kids...
    <br>I would tell them that this man was the man who was going to make me happy.
    <br>I told them that I wanted to come here; that was eight months ago.
    <br>By the time I wanted to come here, things started to get worse.
    <br>Firstly, my husband told me that I had to make a choice – to have a holiday house in Africa
    <br>or go to The SCOAN.
    <br>I told him that if he wanted to see me happy, I wanted to go to The SCOAN.
    <br>I said if the house was meant for me in Africa, I would have it in the name of Jesus
    <br>but that first, I had to look for my freedom.
    <br>He responded that he wanted to see me happy.
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Your husband said, "I promised to build you a mansion back in Uganda.
    <br>Now, make a choice between these two: acquiring this mansion and going to The SCOAN here in Nigeria."
    <br>The woman made the best, wisest choice.
    <br>She told the husband, "Look, I prefer to go to The SCOAN and get my freedom.
    <br>The house is a secondary issue. The primary thing is my freedom."
    <br>The husband said, "Well, let it be according to your wish. I will prepare your passport and visa."
    <br>Not long after that, the DHL brought her passport and visa, right to her house.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Finally, when your visa and passport came to your door post, what happened?
    <br>Three days later, he told me that I had to pack, that I said I was going on Friday,
    <br>so, by Saturday, I would be in Nigeria.
    <br>On Saturday, on my way to the airport, I was smoking.
    <br>When I came out of the airport, it was like I was on fire
    <br>because I had been on the flight for so long.
    <br>I took my things out of the airport and on standing there,
    <br>the driver asked me if he could put my luggage in his car.
    <br>I said no, that I had to fulfil this: I smoked three cigarettes at the same time.
    <br>When I arrived at the hotel, I smoked another cigarette before being taken to my room.
    <br>I came downstairs and by the pool, I smoked another two sticks before paying the driver off.
    <br>The taxi driver asked, “Madam, are you not smoking too much?”
    <br>I responded, “What is too much? This is not too much; I haven’t smoked for many hours”.
    <br>Then, he left.
    <br>For the whole night, I couldn’t sleep because I wanted to come here.
    <br>That was the time that I smoked even more than usual.
    <br>For the whole Saturday night, I was smoking.
    <br>I didn't sleep, I was awake.
    <br>At 3am, I prepared myself; I told the taxi to come at four.
    <br>At 4am, he was there.
    <br>I was outside with a cup of coffee and a smoke.
    <br>I had already smoked ten by that time.
    <br>When there is something that you want so badly,
    <br>there will also be many things that will want to stop you.
    <br>It was hard to come in but when I came in, I sat over there.
    <br>I was praying and suddenly the man of God came in.
    <br>When he came in, he was talking to people and I began to sleep.
    <br>I did not hear a word he was saying because I was sleeping.
    <br>I went outside and poured water on myself but I was still sleepy.
    <br>I asked myself, “What is this?”
    <br>The time I woke up, he was on the gallery, delivering people.
    <br>I started panicking.
    <br>I was looking forward to this but I was panicking.
    <br>I was telling a man that I needed to go outside and get some fresh air.
    <br>He told me that the man of God was already here.
    <br>I said no, that I would make it.
    <br>It was not because I wanted fresh air but I was panicking and wanted to smoke.
    <br>I wanted to smoke because I was scared.
    <br>The moment I was talking with him, I heard people around me making noises.
    <br>I closed my eyes and held myself like this.
    <br>Then suddenly I felt something like a hammer hit my head, people of God.
    <br>Mrs Lucy Atim Hansen
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>It was not a touch, it was a hammer.
    <br>Then I was like, “Who hit me like that?”
    <br>I touched my head because I thought my head was smashed.
    <br>I screamed, that was the only thing I knew.
    <br>The next thing I knew I was somewhere here on those stairs.
    <br>They were telling me, “It’s OK, sister, calm down”.
    <br>I was in awe but also so mad that I felt I could tear them into pieces.
    <br>As the day went, my anger subsided.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, watch the screen of your TV;
    <br>that was exactly what the sister is narrating as part of her experience.
    <br>She came and sat down in the church.
    <br>When the man of God was about to give messages of prophecy and was moving forward,
    <br>close to where she was, she started to feel terrible heat inside of her,
    <br>to the extent that she was telling the person next to her that she wanted to leave the church premises.
    <br>The person sitting next to her said, "You don't need to go out. The man of God is coming closer".
    <br>She said she needed to find fresh air.
    <br>That was exactly, without being told, when the evil spirit was actually troubling her,
    <br>because darkness and light have no meeting point.
    <br>Exactly in the moment the man of God came close to her, she felt uncomfortable.
    <br>When the man of God laid his hand on her, the evil spirit started manifesting
    <br>as you can see on the screen of your TV.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>After that touch, I got my deliverance but I was still mad.
    <br>Later in the evening, I was prayed for again and felt the same bang on my head.
    <br>I said, “God, do I have to be beaten many times like this today?”
    <br>It was late in the evening when the programme finished.
    <br>The workers told the man of God that my hotel was very far, close to the airport.
    <br>He instructed them that I should not go to my hotel but that I should stay in the church
    <br>because at that late time, it was risky.
    <br>They prepared a nice place for me with a nice bed.
    <br>Normally, I did not just fall asleep
    <br>but I was so tired that I just fell on my bed with the same clothes and slept.
    <br>Suddenly, something just lifted me up.
    <br>People of God, I was in the air like this, hanging.
    <br>I said, "Wow, what is that?"
    <br>I was so heavy, on the roof of the house
    <br>and when I suddenly woke up, I dropped onto the bed again.
    <br>I was scared and something came out of me!
    <br>I could feel it.
    <br>It was like I was two persons and someone pulled me up and left.
    <br>I turned around to look at where it was going and I was in awe and went back to sleep again.
    <br>A few minutes later, it happened again up to three times and I went back to sleep again.
    <br>The following day on a Monday, I went back to the hotel.
    <br>When I reached the hotel, I said, “Now that I am not in the church, I can take a smoke”.
    <br>When I tried to smoke, it was not tasting the same.
    <br>I said, "Ah".
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>It is indeed a wonderful experience.
    <br>I thought that it may have been because I had not been smoking.
    <br>I was in the church the whole day and night and I did not smoke.
    <br>I went up, got a coffee, went to the pool and tried to light a cigarette but it was not working.
    <br>The driver was asking me why I was throwing away the whole cigarette.
    <br>I told him that it did not taste the same and that maybe I was delivered from smoking as well.
    <br>He replied that he thought so too.
    <br>Then I said that if I was delivered from smoking and I try to force myself to smoke,
    <br>then it is like I am testing, or trying God that if He was real, He should take it away from me.
    <br>He has already taken it away from me, then I will not try it again.
    <br>I had 12 sealed packets of cigarettes.
    <br>Each packet had 30 cigarettes.
    <br>I took all of them and four lighters to where there was a big ash tray outside the hotel,
    <br>left them there, got into a taxi and came here.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>At the end of the day, you are letting us know that right now, as you are talking,
    <br>you have stopped smoking.
    <br>I haven’t smoked since Sunday.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>God lives in this house.
    <br>He is alive.
    <br>I tried to attain deliverance in many kinds of churches
    <br>but I have never received this kind of touch.
    <br>Usually after finishing a church service, I would go outside and smoke or go to the hospital
    <br>but since I came here, I now eat and go to the toilet normally which was not the case before.
    <br>I do everything normally. I don’t have the urge to smoke.
    <br>This is someone who would smoke every five minutes. I don’t have the feeling to smoke.
    <br>When I pass people outside there who are smoking,
    <br>I don’t have the feeling to do the same.
    <br>What about the migraine and depression?
    <br>I don’t have depression and I feel happy.
    <br>Secondly, the man of God has been treating me like his baby.
    <br>This is the kind of treatment that I have never had.
    <br>He gave me a place to stay.
    <br>Could you just explain to us the pictures we can see on the notice board.
    <br>As you can see here, this is my husband.
    <br>This is my first son.
    <br>This is the second.
    <br>This is the third.
    <br>This is the fourth.
    <br>This is the last.
    <br>As you can see on this board - this is a letter from my doctor,
    <br>stating that I was undergoing treatment for migraine and psychiatric treatment.
    <br>Every third month, I had to get 40 to 50 injections inside my nerves
    <br>and at the back of my head to relax my muscles.
    <br>This is what you see here.
    <br>But after you were delivered, old things passed away, all things have become new.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>I had a lot of medications that I took every day, like six to seven
    <br>but I have not been feeling any pain.
    <br>I had two operations on my right shoulder and was preparing to go for a third one
    <br>but I do not feel any pain; I can sleep without pain.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Finally, we thank the Lord Almighty for setting you free from this trouble,
    <br>taking you out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light.
    <br>Viewers around the world and in the church, the only advice I can give you is one thing:
    <br>If you see a child looking for your shoulder to rest her or his head on, please take that child as yours.
    <br>Respect that child as you respect your own.
    <br>Give them love because you do not know tomorrow.
    <br>God will reward you.
    <br>Take care of the little ones.
    <br>Don’t let them suffer.
    <br>Thank you, let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We strongly believe that that piece of advice is coming from your past experience in life.
    <br>We believe you are rejuvenated, old things passed away, all things have become new.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what the Lord Jesus has done in your life.
    <br>We pray that your deliverance, healing and breakthrough will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>and as you go and do so, always have it at the back of your mind, that better is not good enough,
    <br>the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
