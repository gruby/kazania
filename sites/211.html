  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>I am happy to see smiles on people's faces.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>And you never allow any news or whatever you hear to disturb you.
    <br>There is news in international media all over,
    <br>most especially in our state, Lagos State which for the first time,
    <br>you are hearing that kind of news; it's on the internet - everywhere.
    <br>We Christians, whatever we hear that is not positive
    <br>is meant to strengthen our desire and to see the need for God in our lives.
    <br>Some news that were spread everywhere said that there may be an attack in any hotel in Lagos.
    <br>I said, "In Lagos?"
    <br>I asked God, "What about this news that is flying around?"
    <br>When we hear something, we examine it in the light of God's Word.
    <br>I know many of you came this morning from a hotel to the church.
    <br>Some are still lodging all over in different hotels.
    <br>I asked God, "What is this news all about? Is it a rumour or what?"
    <br>The Lord was telling me that it is a blessing for us to see the need for God in our lives.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And remember what I said.
    <br>Whatever plan of evil in Lagos will prove abortive.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>It is true; they are in the town but whatever effort or plan will be nullified.
    <br>There is no cause for fear; there is no cause for alarm.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Yes.
    <br>One thing they have to know.
    <br>An attack on Lagos is an attack on the source.
    <br>Lagosians will not chase shadows.
    <br>Chasing shadows is chasing an errand boy.
    <br>I am talking to you in parables.
    <br>An attack on Lagos is an attack on the source.
    <br>Lagosians will not chase shadows.
    <br>Chasing shadows is chasing an errand boy.
    <br>The people carrying guns and attacking are errand boys.
    <br>If you are arresting them and killing them, you are wasting your time.
    <br>Go to the source.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Once again;
    <br>an attack on Lagos is an attack on the source.
    <br>Lagosians will not chase shadows.
    <br>Chasing shadows is chasing an errand boy.
    <br>If you kill or arrest thousands of errand boys,
    <br>millions of them are ready to emerge; they are everywhere - errand boys.
    <br>5 000, 3 000 - they will carry guns because of hunger.
    <br>Don't forget: Lagos is a commercial hub and centre.
    <br>Everyone of us has commercial interest
    <br>and it is a place you cannot avoid.
    <br>An attack on Lagos State is an attack on the source.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>It is a very expensive joke; and I know it is a joke.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Very very expensive, costly joke.
    <br>It is a joke.
    <br>Tell them it is a joke.
    <br>Very very expensive.
    <br>It is too costly.
    <br>For somebody to tell you that your dear mum at home, who is still very young, so dear to you;
    <br>somebody calls and says, "You mummy is dead" - it is too expensive.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Nothing happened to your mum and you are saying, "My mummy is dead".
    <br>Later on they say, "I'm joking" - you don't play with that.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Too expensive.
    <br>Nigeria is not in the dark concerning militants or whatever name you call them.
    <br>They know everything that is happening.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>If truly their mission is clear, their grievances or disagreements
    <br>should not be against common people on the street or school children.
    <br>They should go to their political thugs in the past;
    <br>they should go and attack those who recruited them in the past.
    <br>Not common people, not common citizen...
    <br>Their grievances should not be against common people.
    <br>Their grievances should not be against school children or innocent worshippers.
    <br>They are not in a political party; they are looking for their daily bread.
    <br>Since all this mess; how many senators, governors, people that matter they have attacked and killed?
    <br>And they are killing "market people".
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>This shows they can't kill those who sent them.
    <br>If they are freelancers, fighting for the pain or grievances - go straight and do what...
    <br>You would not carry gun and kill your people.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>What are we talking about?
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Their grievances should not be against the common people on the street
    <br>looking for a bus from one station to another station.
    <br>School children, innocent worshippers; these are the records we have about killing.
    <br>These are innocent people.
    <br>We cannot define your mission.
    <br>When we are still looking for 200 plus children
    <br>and there is news of an attack on Lagos, that is not good news for us.
    <br>International community and world-power nations
    <br>should look at what they can do to support and help the nation, Nigeria.
    <br>Not to give us another news.
    <br>If there is any news like that, they should make a call to the country concerned -
    <br>call them and warn their embassy.
    <br>It does not speak well of our nation.
    <br>We should know the difference between political parties and Nigeria.
    <br>Nigeria is calm.
    <br>It is politics and political parties that are not calm.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>There is a difference between Nigeria as a nation and politics.
    <br>It is true, Nigeria gave birth to political parties
    <br>and political parties gave birth to militants and Boko Haram.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>There is a difference between Nigeria and political parties, whatever party you belong to.
    <br>It is true, Nigeria gave birth to political parties.
    <br>Political parties gave birth to militants or whatever name you call them.
    <br>They gave birth to them.
    <br>We should know the difference.
    <br>It is time now, we should put Nigeria first; protect the nation, Nigeria.
    <br>Know the difference between your political party...
    <br>At this time now, we have to protect the name, Nigeria.
    <br>Forget about your political parties.
    <br>They should suspend all rallies, acrimonious campaign of calumny.
    <br>They should forget about that.
    <br>Let us sit down as Nigerians and talk about Nigeria.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>It is this division that gave opportunity to hoodlums -
    <br>the division among political class -
    <br>it gave an opportunity to militants and whatever you call them.
    <br>They explore and exploit.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>How can 200 people be somewhere
    <br>and we are talking of rallies, political parties, campaigns,
    <br>disagreements between two political parties.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>It is time they should call off political parties and say,
    <br>"Look, forget about political parties. This is a threat towards the nation. Please! Where are our 200 children?"
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Suspend these party issues until further notice and discuss.
    <br>We are one if not for the political parties.
    <br>All this bring division.
    <br>Let's forget about it.
    <br>We are one; let us talk as Nigerians.
    <br>What has happened?
    <br>Let's protect the name, Nigeria.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>We are dealing with evil spirits; let us not deal with our neighbours.
    <br>We are dealing with evil spirits that kill, steal and destroy;
    <br>let us not deal with our neighbours.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Your response determines their exploits - the militants,
    <br>that is their attack, their operation.
    <br>Fear and panic help their operation.
    <br>Guns and bombs are not their main weapons.
    <br>Their main weapons are evil spirits.
    <br>This is why it is difficult for our security agencies to tackle the situation.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>When you see the person carrying gun, you will see the gun that is more costly than him.
    <br>Somebody wearing rug and carrying AK-47 - do you know how expensive it it?
    <br>Do you know how much is the bomb?
    <br>And somebody on the street is carrying bomb - do you know how much bomb costs?
    <br>Therefore, for you to know that their real, major weapon is not guns or bombs but evil spirits.
    <br>Before they can bomb or shoot, they will consult the evil spirit.
    <br>If the evil spirit says, "Don't go there or fire", they will not.
    <br>They need to consult the evil spirit.
    <br>Our soldiers, our security, whom are you consulting before you shoot?
    <br>You need the Spirit of God's suggestion as to what to do next.
    <br>If not, we are chasing shadows.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>If our political class does not stop their party rallies
    <br>and acrimonious campaigns for the meantime and talk about Nigeria -
    <br>write it down - these people will turn against the big shots in Nigeria
    <br>and will leave the common people.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>They will turn against big shots, political class.
    <br>You talk of senator, governor - they will turn against them.
    <br>You will begin to hear, "This senator died, this governor is killed..."
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>They have to immediately, now forget and cancel any rally or campaign
    <br>and put aside the party they belong to and come together and say,
    <br>"Please, let's forget about parties. Let's talk about Nigeria."
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Because your party gave birth to them.
    <br>Party gave birth to those people: militants or whatever name they have.
    <br>So, for now - this is way out.
    <br>But my people - sleep and close your eyes.
    <br>If somebody comes and tell you that somebody is coming to bomb your house,
    <br>say, "It is not my house. These are not my companies. It is not my premises."
    <br>Your response determines their operation.
    <br>Fear and panic help their operation
    <br>because they are being controlled by evil spirits;
    <br>not by gun or bomb.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>You can't fight evil spirits with evil spirit because they are many in numbers
    <br>but you with God are more than numbers.
    <br>You cannot fight evil spirits with evil spirit and win
    <br>because they are many in numbers
    <br>but you with God are more than numbers.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>It is time to see the need for God.
    <br>Once again; take this home:
    <br>if our political class doesn't stop their campaign and rallies and put aside parties,
    <br>and come together, "Let's discuss as a Nigeria"...
    <br>Write it down - this is the voice of God:
    <br>These people will turn against them.
    <br>Any moment from now, you will begin to hear of big shots being attacked.
    <br>If they had been attacking the big shots, they would have found solution to this.
    <br>The solution would come.
    <br>They would stop rallies, parties, campaigns, if that shots were attacked.
    <br>But our children, common people, innocent people and worshippers...
    <br>Forget about your political party and let's talk about Nigeria.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>You met Nigeria and you will leave Nigeria.
    <br>You don't know the beginning and you will not know the end of Nigeria.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>They gave birth to you and you met Nigeria as a nation
    <br>and you will not even see the end before you leave this world.
    <br>This is a call.
    <br>National Conference - there is a lot of diverse issues now.
    <br>Many things are on the ground now.
    <br>The main issue seems to be abandoned because nobody would talk of any issue without security.
    <br>When you are in a National Conference and you are discussing;
    <br>you learn people have been bombed - would you continue your discussion?
    <br>You learn school children have been kidnapped - would you continue your discussion?
    <br>Whatever you are discussing - you put is aside and begin to discuss about security.
    <br>This is a tactic, strategy of an enemy.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>This is to tell you,
    <br>the National Conference - they need to redefine it.
    <br>The definition they carried there seems to have changed now.
    <br>We have to redefine what is discussed there
    <br>because there is disagreement.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Finally, quote me as a Prophet; sleep and close your eyes.
    <br>The news about attack in Lagos - I never said these people were not in Lagos.
    <br>They are in Lagos but they have no business in Lagos.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Every kind of person is in Lagos; criminal, good person, bad person -
    <br>it is a commercial centre of Africa.
    <br>So, everybody is in Lagos, no doubt about that.
    <br>Thugs, militants, killers, good people are in Lagos.
    <br>Yes! But these people for now...
    <br>It would be very very expensive - they have no business in Lagos.
    <br>They are in Lagos to do normal business.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Your response determines their operation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Your response determines their operation.]
    <br>I am not talking to only Nigeria now, I am talking to the whole world.
    <br>Your response determines their operation.
    <br>Fear and panic help their operation
    <br>because their real weapon is evil spirits.
    <br>Bombs or guns of all sorts are secondary issues.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>Because 90% of them are not trained to carry it.
    <br>It's quack training, if they train.
    <br>It is like at war in a nation - they catch people and teach them in 2 seconds how to use gun.
    <br>That is not a normal training, you can not use it properly.
    <br>It is that evil spirit.
    <br>Their real, major weapons are not bombs or guns of all sorts but evil spirits.
    <br>Your response determines their operation.
    <br>Fear and panic help their operation.
    <br>You hear the news, you get to run - they test the ground.
    <br>They say, "Yes, let's go there".
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>They have spies everywhere.
    <br>They say, "Yes, they are free. OK, let's go there."
    <br>They know your spirit is not an overcomer.
    <br>They know their evil spirits have overcome you already, so therefore they should come and bomb.
    <br>But if they hear that despite noise, letter and whatever you hear you say, "If you say you are this - come!
    <br>I believe you are not serious of what you are talking about."
    <br>That is Holy Spirit against an evil spirit.
    <br>Your response matters - be careful of what you confess.
    <br>What you say about your nation too...
    <br>Many of us travel outside the country, give interviews, "Nigeria has no light, food..."
    <br>You have forgotten that it is where you were born.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SPEAKS On Boko Haram, Chibok Girls, Warns Nigerian Politicians
    <br>You have forgotten that it is not Jonathan you are talking about.
    <br>Nigeria is bigger than Jonathan, the president.
    <br>The nation is bigger than anybody.
    <br>So, when we are talking, "There is no this... It is a bad country... They kill people",
    <br>you forget that this nation is bigger than anybody.
    <br>You rubbish the name of your nation, you are selling your nation for zero,
    <br>thinking that you are attacking the president or the governor - no!
    <br>Our nation should be first.
    <br>Protect the name of your country.
    <br>What is happening here is happening everywhere in different ways.
    <br>Tell me the nation today that had...
    <br>They have their own different situations; every country, all over the world.
    <br>What are you saying?
    <br>Why do you rubbish your nation and forget that you are a Nigerian?
    <br>No one will come and build this nation for you, you will build it.
    <br>What you are confessing is not helping Nigeria.
    <br>Because of money you can become an agent to any reporter of national news or medium.
    <br>"... it happened..." - you continue to destroy your nation because of money they pay you.
    <br>The children yet unborn will ask you, and it is a grave sin.
    <br>The nation you benefit from, that gave birth to you, where you were little;
    <br>they never killed you but here you are today.
    <br>You have now become an enemy of your country; you exaggerate little things,
    <br>as if what has happened here has not happened anywhere in the world.
    <br>You call for war.
    <br>Where is war.
    <br>Which war are you fighting?
    <br>Do you know the people you are fighting?
    <br>Do you know them?
    <br>It is a pity.
    <br>You are to rebrand your country.
    <br>We are dealing with evil spirits; let us not deal with our neighbours.
    <br>Please.
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>The present situation with Nigeria: You can't have any election for now.
    <br>If the situation continues like this, you cannot have any election.
    <br>In order to have a wonderful, good atmosphere for elections tomorrow,
    <br>they should do what I have said now.
