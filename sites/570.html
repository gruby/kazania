    <br>Degrading, humiliating, hopeless,
    <br>unimaginable, demoralizing, miserable and totally isolated.
    <br>This depicts the life of many physically challenged people across Nigeria.
    <br>Heaving his lifeless limbs, this young man rolls his way into The SCOAN.
    <br>This is his only form of movement.
    <br>- Hello. Tell us your name.
    <br>- My name is Idris.
    <br>I don't have any work.
    <br>I'm a beggar.
    <br>Whenever I beg, the money I get is what I use for feeding.
    <br>I don't have anywhere to stay.
    <br>I live under the bridge.
    <br>I heard people saying that the man of God helps people here.
    <br>I am a beggar. That is why I came, so that I can be helped.
    <br>Living under the bridge and completely unable to take care of himself,
    <br>Idris explains that he is a beggar.
    <br>He has painfully managed to reach The SCOAN.
    <br>After hearing about the charitable works at the church,
    <br>he is hoping that there may be some way out of his pitiful situation.
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>Carried awkwardly by two men, this man comes to The SCOAN totally helpless
    <br>and dependant on the good will of those around him.
    <br>When we give we receive
    <br>More of whatever we give
    <br>This woman drags herself along the road of The SCOAN on all fours.
    <br>She is without any other means of mobility,
    <br>socially rejected and impoverished by her feeble state.
    <br>Yet another gentleman arrives, hold into the auditorium by two helpers.
    <br>Both his legs had been amputated.
    <br>It is clear to see the physical strain and difficulty it takes just to move him a short distance.
    <br>SHOCKING: The Boy Who ROLLED Himself To Church!
    <br>While still, there are those who have resorted to the use of mere wheelbarrows
    <br>to move themselves around.
    <br>This young man is just one example among thousands.
    <br>I came for the man of God to help me for feeding and accommodation
    <br>and be able to earn a living.
    <br>The person standing behind me is the one helping me to bath and to take care of myself.
    <br>He also assists me with the wheelbarrow, so that I can beg for money to eat.
    <br>If I gain a little money from begging, I am able to eat. If not, I go hungry.
    <br>I sleep wherever I find myself after begging, until I wake up the next day.
    <br>I am here because I heard that the man of God is helping people.
    <br>Whatever God puts in the mind of the man of God to give me, I will be grateful.
    <br>When his begging gains him any money, this young man explains that he is able to buy a meal,
    <br>but all to often he goes to sleep hungry and without any form of shelter.
    <br>He has sought out The SCOAN in a hope of getting the assistance he needs
    <br>just to sustain himself.
    <br>Their only means of movement - lines of the physically challenged glide into the church auditorium
    <br>on makeshift skateboards.
    <br>Due to their want, other alternatives are few and far between.
    <br>They are followed by a woman, who tragically crawls along the ground,
    <br>accompanied by her five small children.
    <br>One cannot begin to imagine how a mother must feel
    <br>trapped in such a frustrating and desperate situation.
    <br>Led by the Emmanuel TV team, many blind enter the church in single file,
    <br>holding onto the person in front of them for support, forming a human chain,
    <br>ready to join a host of others, waiting expectantly for something
    <br>that will make a difference in their world.
    <br>Their 'please' are of desperation and want.
    <br>Let's listen to them.
    <br>My name is Babatunde.
    <br>I need help from the pastor.
    <br>I had an accident and they cut my two legs.
    <br>I need money to sponsor myself and I need a wheelchair.
    <br>This man said that due to an accident both his legs have been amputated.
    <br>He is requesting a wheelchair and financial assistance.
    <br>I need accommodation.
    <br>I have no food and I have five children.
    <br>My husband died and there is nothing to feed my children with.
    <br>I need a wheelchair and money.
    <br>This woman narrates her story.
    <br>Her husband has died leaving her with five children to take care of.
    <br>She needs a wheelchair, accommodation and money to feed and cater for her family.
    <br>We have here three trailers of rice, which is worth 12,750,000 naira.
    <br>2. We have transportation and feeding - 10,000,000 naira.
    <br>3. We are going to present you some wheelchairs today.
    <br>The total is 30,750,000 naira.
    <br>T.B. Joshua announces the provision of three trailers of rice,
    <br>transportation, feeding costs, special gifts and wheelchairs,
    <br>totalling the sum of 30,750,000 naira, which is the equivalent of $261,000.
    <br>Three trailers of rice were especially brought in to meet the needs of crowds of the physically challenged,
    <br>who came to The SCOAN that day.
    <br>Quantity of sacks we can see arriving are enormous but very necessary,
    <br>if each and every physically challenged person was to receive their very own bag.
    <br>The provision of food is something no one should be in want of.
    <br>What a real privilege to be in a position to give.
    <br>There were hundreds and hundreds of bags of rice,
    <br>a gift worth over 10,000,000 naira.
    <br>SHOCKING: The Boy Who ROLLED Himself To Church!
    <br>Brand new wheel chairs are also arranged and pushed into The SCOAN,
    <br>in preparation for those who are in dire need of them.
    <br>We have some wheelchairs for you - so please, bring them.
    <br>SHOCKING: The Boy Who ROLLED Himself To Church!
    <br>As T.B. Joshua instructs the wheelchairs to be brought forward,
    <br>and for their new owners to be lifted into them.
    <br>Just imagine the years of sorrow that have been wiped away in an instant,
    <br>as a sense of dignity and of worth are restored.
    <br>What a joy to do things as if Christ were the One doing them.
    <br>Remember the extreme and unimaginable condition of this boy,
    <br>when he arrived earlier today at The SCOAN.
    <br>The smile lightens his face, as his hours of rolling his body along the ground
    <br>have eventually come to an end.
    <br>He is proudly pushed along in his brand new wheelchair.
    <br>The prayers of many years are not lost,
    <br>as today in the lives of many physically challenged,
    <br>they have, in due time, issued into beauty and glory,
    <br>as long sought after provision has come.
    <br>Those who came to the meeting with no proper form of aid
    <br>will leave with the essential provision of their very own wheelchair.
    <br>For those whom we have seen today without the love and support of organizations
    <br>such as Emmanuel TV -
    <br>how could their hope ever have been restored?
    <br>As the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith...
    <br>People who were once living lives of ridicule, subjected to crawling,
    <br>sitting and dragging themselves along the ground
    <br>have found a peace of conscience, ease of heart and the hope of integration into the society.
    <br>For this woman, she will now have the prospect of being able to work
    <br>and fulfill her role as a mother in the lives of her children.
    <br>SHOCKING: The Boy Who ROLLED Himself To Church!
    <br>Truly, Jesus Christ changes lives for good.
    <br>He is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>Her children thankful for what God has done in her life
    <br>join their mother as she enjoys the increased comfort of her new wheelchair.
    <br>Each wheelchair that has been given was acquired by Emmanuel TV,
    <br>intended specifically for this occasion - the meeting of the physically challenged.
    <br>The expense today is 30,750,000 naira.
    <br>Everybody will go home with a bag of rice and money to take care of you.
    <br>T.B. Joshua reassured those present that everyone would receive their own bag of rice
    <br>and financial support to take care of their welfare until the next meeting.
    <br>As directed by T.B. Joshua, the Emmanuel TV team begin to hand out the promised cash gifts,
    <br>starting with those cases that had just been attended to.
    <br>God is rich beyond our dreams.
    <br>They will leave today not only with a new wheelchair
    <br>but also with enough finances to set up new businesses,
    <br>to acquire housing and provide for the other basic necessities of life.
    <br>Rice bags were also carried to where they were sitting,
    <br>an additional blessing to those who had previously been begging just to eat a single meal.
    <br>Envelops bearing 50,000 naira inside them are held dearly by their recipients.
    <br>The prospects of a better future now lies in their hands.
    <br>Emmanuel TV bags cheerfully and carefully given to the entire crowd
    <br>contain cash gifts to support them until the next physically challenged meeting.
    <br>What we give for the relief of the poor and the support of God's worship
    <br>is actually given unto God.
    <br>God has no farm where He expects us to work for Him,
    <br>or an office where He expects us to help Him in checking files.
    <br>His farm and His office are our fellow brothers.
    <br>Whatever we do or fail to do to the least of our brothers, that we do unto Christ.
    <br>He has no hands but our hands to do His work today.
    <br>He has no help but our help to bring men to His side.
    <br>SHOCKING: The Boy Who ROLLED Himself To Church!
    <br>Having received their cash gifts, bags of rice continue to be circulated around the church,
    <br>as the Emmanuel TV team endeavours to make sure everyone goes home with their own sack.
    <br>To know the Saviour brings great joy, the kind of joy that nothing can destroy.
    <br>Faces that once wore expressions of sorrow, now bear broad smiles.
    <br>This is a day that many will never forget.
    <br>When we give we receive
    <br>More of whatever we give
    <br>When we give we are planting 
    <br>Seeds that will be multiplied
    <br>T.B. Joshua helps a number of physically challenged people,
    <br>as they make their way out of the auditorium,
    <br>putting love into action and following the footsteps of Christ,
    <br>appreciative of the knowledge that giving is a rare grace
    <br>and opportunity that is not given to all men.
    <br>Let us ask God to make us one of those rarest souls,
    <br>leading us to grow in love until it flows to others.
