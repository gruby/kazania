    <br>Viewers, the message about Africa: No African country can succeed alone.
    <br>African countries need each other to succeed.
    <br>Dear Africa, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.
    <br>Africa unite!
    <br>Let us pray viewers all over the world.
    <br>Stretch your hand towards the screen.
    <br>Wherever you are under the influence of my voice -
    <br>right now, I say to that infirmity, I say to that sickness:
    <br>let the power of God come down!
    <br>Wherever the disease is located - in your blood, tendons, fluids and bones -
    <br>whatever name they call it - kidney problem - out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever situation you are in right now, with God all things are possible.
    <br>Never a sickness, never a burden Jesus cannot solve.
    <br>I command that situation - be surmounted, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be moved, in the name of Jesus! I command them out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I say - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That situation in your blood, fluids, tendons, kidney - whatever name they call it -
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal; never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, let your story change!
    <br>I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm saved!
    <br>Let your story change! Yes, let your story change, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>With God, all things are possible -
    <br>just believe.
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>I say to your business - flourish, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say to your career - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever stage your career is - great, right now!
    <br>Great!
    <br>This is the voice of God.
    <br>I say to your career, whatever stage your career is - imbalanced, epileptic -
    <br>your business, your finances - I say, great, great, move, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Move, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Dry bones shall rise again!
    <br>Your family, your marriage - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say to you, anywhere you are, whatever medium you are using to view us right now -
    <br>right now, just believe, in the name of Jesus, by faith -
    <br>you are healed, delivered and set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can't wait to hear your testimony!
    <br>Once again, Africa, Africa, Africa!
    <br>Africa has neglected her youth.
    <br>Africa has abandoned the youth to themselves.
    <br>Africa has failed to provide provision for her youth.
    <br>Anytime I think about the future of Africa, I have sleepless nights.
    <br>Everything looks gloomy, sunless, dark, darksome, shadowy and dull.
    <br>Africa, Africa!
    <br>Lord Jesus, we commit the nations of Africa into Your hands - redeem the nations,
    <br>redeem the continent of Africa, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Redeem our leaders, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Wherever there are troubled spots all over the world,
    <br>Father, Lord Jesus, come and rescue the nations.
    <br>All over the world, rescue the nations. There is trouble all over the world.
    <br>Father, we know with You, all things are possible.
    <br>We know with You, dry bones shall rise again.
    <br>Whatever pain, whatever area - the nations that are at war,
    <br>Father, Lord Jesus - be calm, let peace restore - unity!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>I leave you in faith.
    <br>You will see me back in faith.
    <br>I shall meet you in faith. Thank you.
