  <p>    
    <br>My name is Blessing Iloanya. I'm from Anambra State.
    <br>I'm a civil servant.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that
    <br>I am addicted to sniffing and drinking kerosene.
    <br>I'm going to prove that it is kerosene. I'm going to burn this piece of wood.
    <br>Wow, my God!
    <br>My God!
    <br>Kerosene
    <br>That's kerosene indeed.
    <br>The woman beside me is my mum.
    <br>It all started about 18 years ago when I was in secondary school.
    <br>There was this particular day when a thought came to me
    <br>that this kerosene would be nice, I should try it.
    <br>So, I cut a piece of paper, soaked it into the kerosene and started sniffing it.
    <br>From sniffing the kerosene, I started sucking and drinking it.
    <br>From there, I started taking it every day.
    <br>Then, I discovered that to enjoy it more, I would go and buy biscuits and soak them in the kerosene.
    <br>Viewers,  I hope you are watching.
    <br>Viewers, all over the world, are you watching?
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Woman Eating A Biscuit Dipped Into Kerosene
    <br>Wow.
    <br>If you know that solution has come for you, raise up your hand!
    <br>Your own passes kerosene?
    <br>[No!]
    <br>It usually tastes very nice. I enjoy it.
    <br>I have tried on my own to stop it.
    <br>I tried to keep kerosene away from anywhere I stay but every time I would see it,
    <br>I would dip my hand into it and begin to sniff it and put it in my mouth
    <br>Blessing dips the tissue into the kerosene to demonstrate how she sniffs and drinks it.
    <br>She continues to suck all the kerosene out of the tissue and swallows it.
    <br>This is one of the methods she uses to consume the kerosene.
    <br>I take it every day but I've tried to stop it on my own;
    <br>I tried to keep kerosene away from my house.
    <br>Since how many years now?
    <br>For 18 years now.
    <br>You have tried all.
    <br>Yes, I've tried on my own; I´ve prayed but it's not working.
    <br>Man of God, it has affected my life in so many ways.
    <br>Most times when I take it, my stomach would be upset.
    <br>I would begin to to go to the toilet very often.
    <br>My life is full of hardship and disappointment.
    <br>Who has Anointing Water?
    <br>A man steps forward.
    <br>You just watch.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I command you out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>You spirit of killing, stealing and destruction, in the name of Jesus Christ, out!
    <br>Jesus is greater than you!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, she is free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>What happened when he was spraying the Anointing Water?
    <br>I was feeling some kind of sensation inside me.
    <br>Blessing takes the tissue and dips it once again into the kerosene to observe if truly she is delivered.
    <br>To God be the glory! Blessing is finally delivered!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are now a normal human being. This is what is supposed to happen.
    <br>If you go home now, if you take kerosene,
    <br>even if you perceive the odour of kerosene, you will cough.
    <br>This is a normal human being now.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>It's irritating.
    <br>Okay, what happened? Why are you coughing?
    <br>It is the irritation that is making me cough.
    <br>She has been drinking it for the past 18 years and she never coughed.
    <br>The little she has just taken now, she is vomiting it which is normal for a human being.
    <br>That shows that this woman was not normal before.
    <br>She is  just getting normal now.
    <br>Do you see?
    <br>What has happened to you?
    <br>The taste is not okay anymore. I hate the taste.
    <br>My system is irritated.
    <br>To God be the glory! Blessing is finally delivered.
    <br>She applies a hand washing product to remove the kerosene from her hands.
    <br>On the left, we witness the burning of real kerosene -
    <br>the product Blessing had an addiction for, for the past 18 years.
    <br>On the right, Blessing uses mouthwash to get rid of the taste that now irritates her after her deliverance.
    <br>On the left, we also saw the demonstration of the different methods
    <br>Blessing formerly used to consume kerosene on a daily basis.
    <br>Sniffing it profusely with a tissue and drinking it time and time again
    <br>until all the kerosene had been completely drained out of it.
    <br>She also dipped biscuits into the kerosene as to soak the kerosene in the biscuit
    <br>and then consume it without any hesitation.
    <br>These are just some of the ways she had consumed kerosene for the past 18 years.
    <br>Indeed, this was not normal.
    <br>This was the work of evil spirits.
    <br>But to God be the glory, she received her deliverance and her 18-year hazardous habit
    <br>of sniffing and drinking kerosene was put to an end by the author of life - Jesus Christ!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Good morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Blessing Ezekwudo and the man standing by my side is my husband
    <br>and the little girl is my daughter Akuchi.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The lady you saw over there was me.
    <br>Six years ago, I was addicted to sniffing and drinking kerosene.
    <br>It was so bad that even when I went out,
    <br>I would want to run back to the house so that I could continue with my acts.
    <br>Most times, the sniffing would not be enough.
    <br>I would want to drink it and I would want something that would go with it.
    <br>I would go and buy biscuits. I would soak it into the kerosene.
    <br>Before I would know it, I would be chewing and enjoying it.
    <br>After that, I would not eat much food and go to bed.
    <br>it continued and continued. My family knew all about it because I couldn't hide it anymore.
    <br>There was nothing they could do about it.
    <br>I tried stopping on my own but it was not possible.
    <br>I tried, prayed and everything. I couldn't stop it.
    <br>When I saw so many people being delivered on Emmanuel TV of all manner of addictions,
    <br>I said to myself, "I have to go there so that this habit can stop".
    <br>So I came here in January 2012.
    <br>The man of God asked somebody to minister the Anointing Water on me.
    <br>That was done and I was delivered.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, after that, the love, the passion for kerosene died.
    <br>Whenever I saw it, I hated it.
    <br>Two months after that, I met my husband and we got married.
    <br>After that, I had a child.  Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>So, ma'am, can you tell us - what were the challenges when you were still having
    <br>that addiction to drinking and sniffing kerosene at that time?
    <br>The challenges I was passing through were: I always wanted to be on my own.
    <br>I was kind of isolated from people because it was not normal.
    <br>I thought I was hiding it.
    <br>I always wanted to be on my own so I would be able to continue with that act.
    <br>Beside that, I was always having stomach aches.
    <br>My health was affected.
    <br>Your deliverance shows that your prayers for many years are not lost.
    <br>Jesus Christ has answered your prayers through this medium of the New Morning Water.
    <br>What can you say about the medium of the Morning Water that God used to deliver you?
    <br>The medium of the Morning Water is like the blood of Jesus.
    <br>When I was sprayed with the Morning Water, I had a current run all over me, like a fire.
    <br>In fact, it´s the answer for today.
    <br>Amen. Indeed, Jesus Christ uses this medium to bring about healing,
    <br>deliverance and all of God's blessings in the lives of his people.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>I just came here to appreciate the Lord
    <br>for the deliverance of my wife prior to our marriage.
    <br>When we were preparing (to get married) and all that, she explained to me
    <br>that this was the case she had gone through for several years.
    <br>She visited The SCOAN and God in His infinite mercy visited and delivered her
    <br>from that affliction of 18 years as we could see.
    <br>We indeed got married.
    <br>There was no such issue in our life and she is perfectly okay.
    <br>Praise the Lord! Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>What is the message that you have for people out there who are suffering from a similar condition?
    <br>Children of God, whenever you are passing through any challenge, no matter what it is,
    <br>the best thing to do at that time is to run to God through Jesus
    <br>because he said in Romans 8:32 that He didn't spare His son but gave Him freely.
    <br>Shall He not  give us anything that we desire?
    <br>Is it deliverance that you need? Is it breakthrough? Is it healing?
    <br>The best person to run to is God through Jesus who can deliver you
    <br>or give you anything you desire at that point. Praise the Lord!
