  <p>    
    <br>My name is Cynthia.
    <br>I am one of the thousands of Nigerians that were deported from Libya.
    <br>These are my colleagues; we came back from Libya together.
    <br>I went to Libya 8 years ago; I was 18 years old at that time.
    <br>I didn't know anything, I was still very young.
    <br>At that point in time, I was learning hair dressing.
    <br>I was dating a particular guy at that point in time who then told me about the journey to Libya.
    <br>He gave me some connection; that if I go, I will be able to make it over there.
    <br>I closed my salon and everything and followed him.
    <br>When we got there, he sold me to a Nigerian woman who was into human trafficking.
    <br>We could sleep with 20 - 30 men a day, just to be able to pay the money.
    <br>I was so depressed and didn't know what to do.
    <br>They told me that if I didn't pay the money,
    <br>they would kill me and throw my body into the desert
    <br>where my family members would never hear from me again.
    <br>So I had no option but to just do the job.
    <br>While in the house there, we heard gunshots.
    <br>Everybody had it in their mind to run; who could run, would run.
    <br>I was not able to run and they caught me.
    <br>While in prison, the wardens that were taking care of us
    <br>were talking to some Nigerians there.
    <br>While they were talking to a Nigerian and threatening him with a gun,
    <br>that was how I was being shot on my leg.
    <br>On my left leg.
    <br>There was no treatment over there.
    <br>I just stayed there, staying in one position for almost 4 months.
    <br>I was not able to walk or do anything by myself.
    <br>I was just in one position.
    <br>With the assistance of my friends and colleagues, I was able to go to the bathroom.
    <br>It affected my hands, I couldn't move my hands.
    <br>I decided to return to Nigeria.
    <br>One day, I was very sick over there, whilst working for the woman.
    <br>The sickness affected me and I had to cut my hair.
    <br>I was very weak and I was losing strength.
    <br>I begged the woman that I couldn't work for that day, that she should pardon me.
    <br>She refused.
    <br>She used the stick that is used to turn 'eba' to beat me severely
    <br>and put ground pepper in my private part.
    <br>I started rolling on the floor, screaming and 
    <br>shouting for help
    <br>but I didn't see anybody that would help me.
    <br>She sat down there, seeing me rolling, screaming and shouting.
    <br>She didn't answer me at all.
    <br>After that, I left because of the condition of my leg; I was left with a wound.
    <br>Because I didn't have better treatment, the
    <br>gunshot bullet was affecting my whole body.
    <br>I became weak and very sick.
    <br>I was looking so pale and I lost strength.
    <br>So I  went to stay with one of my friends.
    <br>While I was there, I was caught the second time.
    <br>They gave us an option that we should return to our country.
    <br>That even if we didn't make it over there, by returning to our country, we would be able to make it here.
    <br>So, I decided to return to my country to start all over.
    <br>That was how I was deported to Nigeria.
    <br>Can you show us where you had the gunshot wound?
    <br>I was shot here; the bullet passed here and came out from underneath my leg.
    <br>I was very sick when I came back because from my waist downward, I was affected.
    <br>I was very weak and losing strength.
    <br>When I came here, they assigned me to some doctors,
    <br>they gave me some medication that helped me to be able to sleep and eat well.
    <br>I was able to walk well, though I am still feeling pains but I am bearing the pain.
    <br>My advice to young people is that they should not try this thing,
    <br>this illegal journey because it is not good.
    <br>People might post different pictures on the internet that may make you think the place is good,
    <br>"Ah, they are making money there and they are doing well!"
    <br>The place is not good.
    <br>They don't treat us Nigerians well; they beat and treat people like us there like slaves.
    <br>My advice to parents, please take care of your children.
    <br>Don't give your children out to people who are doing human trafficking.
    <br>They may not tell you what they are 
    <br>taking your children to go and do over there.
    <br>They would just tell you that they want to take your child to go over there to do something.
    <br>At the end of the day, they would change the whole story for you.
    <br>So please, parents, be careful of such people.
    <br>Young girls of nowadays, it is not good to date at an early stage
    <br>because in my case, it was through the person I was dating that I got into all these things.
    <br>My name is Mary. I was among the thousands that were deported from Libya.
    <br>I went to Libya because things were not moving well for me.
    <br>I have no parents; nobody to take care of us and my younger siblings.
    <br>I was trying to give them a better future.
    <br>When I was learning hair dressing, I was explaining to my friend,
    <br>"Look at the situation we are in. There is nobody to help".
    <br>My friend advised me to travel.
    <br>That if I travelled, I would be able to take good care of my younger siblings.
    <br>That if I looked at my friends who have travelled, they have acquired cars and houses.
    <br>That if I went there, I would be able to take care of my family.
    <br>I decided to travel; there was nobody to advice me.
    <br>When I started on the journey, it was so tough and I could not come back.
    <br>The journey was 50/50 and I had to continue with the journey.
    <br>If I die, I die. Or I get saved. So I continued the journey.
    <br>I went to the desert - we trekked for 8 hours in the desert with no water or food.
    <br>We spent some days in the desert and then they brought us back.
    <br>They said that we must continue the journey because there was no more going back.
    <br>So many people were dying; children were dying.
    <br>They would dig the ground and bury people alive.
    <br>God helped me and I was able to pass that desert in the hot sun.
    <br>The sun is like fire on the head.
    <br>I got to Libya.
    <br>When I got there, the friend that deceived me in going there abandoned me.
    <br>He did not pay the money I used to go to Libya.
    <br>So they then sold me.
    <br>When they sold me, the man said that I had to do prostitution.
    <br>I told him I vowed in my life never to do prostitution.
    <br>It is not good and a sin against God.
    <br>He insisted I must do it and he beat me up.
    <br>He stripped me naked, and took my picture.
    <br>He cut my hair and finger nails, and 
    <br>took my bra and underwear.
    <br>He threatened to post it on the internet to show what I was doing.
    <br>I told him it is not good and I can't do it.
    <br>He said I must pay the money.
    <br>He beat me every day.
    <br>I had no choice; I cried every day doing prostitution.
    <br>In a day, about 10 men would sleep with me.
    <br>I would be crying.
    <br>Those that would be sleeping with me, when they saw me crying,
    <br>I would tell them that that job was not for me.
    <br>They would go to the man and tell him that they wanted to help me.
    <br>The man would refuse and insist that I must do that prostitution.
    <br>So I had no choice.
    <br>He would beat me and put a bottle inside my private part.
    <br>That I must do it.
    <br>Anytime I worked, he collected the money.
    <br>The police then came to the place, to come and bust that place.
    <br>They took me to prison.
    <br>I was in prison, with no food or water.
    <br>I just asked God to help me,
    <br>because I was always praying, telling God to see me through.
    <br>This work was not for me. Even if I was poor, but God should help me.
    <br>I was praying, "When will I came back to Nigeria? Nigeria is good".
    <br>Many Africans were dying.
    <br>The journey is not good; the road is very bad.
    <br>We were finally deported to Nigeria.
    <br>I came back to Nigeria with nothing.
    <br>All the work I did was in vain.
    <br>When we came here yesterday, the man of God took good care of us.
    <br>He took us to the hospital.
    <br>He listened to our stories.
    <br>So I decided that today, I must come to the church to testify.
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I am 27 years old.
    <br>How long did you spend over there?
    <br>I spent 2 years.
    <br>Okay, two years.
    <br>I would advice the young girls not to travel illegally;
    <br>they should not listen to anyone because they would come with sweet words,
    <br>telling you nice things about the journey.
    <br>It is not good to enter into a relationship at a young age.
    <br>I entered into a relationship at a young age because I had no helper.
    <br>I don't want my sisters to enter into a relationship at a young age.
    <br>I want them to live a better life.
    <br>I am here, thanking God for what He has done for me.
    <br>I thought I was never going to come back to Nigeria
    <br>because I wasn't allowed to make a call whilst I was in Libya.
    <br>My family never knew where I was.
    <br>But I thank God for bringing me here.
    <br>Okay, so you mean you actually regret going on this journey?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And do you now value your country better than where you were traveling to?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Okay. We have listened to the sister.
    <br>Can we listen to the next person?
    <br>I am Washington, I am a Liberian.
    <br>It was my friend who encouraged me to embark on this journey.
    <br>He told me that I am a mechanic and I can travel to work as a mechanic over there
    <br>because there is much money in it.
    <br>So I embarked on the journey. When I got  to Libya, they kidnapped me.
    <br>I called one of my friends in Liberia.
    <br>He sent me 1,700 US dollars to free me from the kidnappers.
    <br>Our brother says his name is Washington and he is originally from Liberia.
    <br>He is one of the deportees from Libya.
    <br>He was actually deceived by a friend to come over to Germany
    <br>through an illegal route, passing through Libya.
    <br>When he was traveling, he was arrested and faced a lot of torture in Libya.
    <br>In the prison, I was beaten every morning and evening.
    <br>When my friend paid the money, the kidnappers refused to free me.
    <br>I had one Nigerian friend in prison.
    <br>He said that when he got to Libya, he was kidnapped and put in prison.
    <br>In prison, he was calling his family to bail him out.
    <br>But he could not get in touch with his family to bail him out.
    <br>It was one of his friends that paid the money to bail him out.
    <br>Even after paying the money, they refused to release him from prison.
    <br>The Nigerian man I met there told me he got the key to the prison
    <br>and he could open the prison door so that everyone inside can escape.
    <br>He opened it and everyone climbed on the fence and jumped down unto the desert.
    <br>He opened it and everyone climbed on the fence and jumped down unto the desert.
    <br>We were in the desert for three days.
    <br>He said while they were in prison and many other people with him,
    <br>there was a Nigerian man who happened to get the keys to the prison.
    <br>the man opened the prison door and they all ran out.
    <br>He spent three days in the desert without food and water.
    <br>In the desert, we scattered; we were six per group.
    <br>As we were going, they kidnapped four persons; I and my brother escaped.
    <br>He said while they were escaping through the desert,
    <br>they divided themselves into groups of six people.
    <br>In his own group of six, four were captured and taken to the prison
    <br>while himself and one other person managed to escape.
    <br>When we escaped, we went to our big man's place.
    <br>We stayed indoors, we couldn't come outside.
    <br>We were in the house throughout.
    <br>That day, he told us he would send us to Italy.
    <br>That same day, they caught us again.
    <br>The police put me in prison; I was there for 8 months.
    <br>He said after that time, he managed to find his way to the sea,
    <br>trying to cross over the Mediterranean sea to Europe.
    <br>The day he was waiting to go on that journey on the sea,
    <br>himself and other people were captured and put in the prison.
    <br>They were arrested and he spent 8 months in prison.
    <br>I was seeing other people going to their country
    <br>but there was no flight from Libya to my country.
    <br>So, I decided to declare myself as Nigerian in order to come to Nigeria.
    <br>While in the prison, I heard about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So, I decided to come to The SCOAN for him to send me back to Liberia.
    <br>He said while he was in the prison, he started hearing about
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and about the church
    <br>and how the man of God has been helping the deportees from Libya.
    <br>When they come back to the country, the man of God would help them,
    <br>trying to integrate them back into the society and establish them.
    <br>He said that the organisations that were deporting them to different countries came
    <br>and people from different countries were deported.
    <br>But for him, there were no flight going to his country
    <br>because he was the only Liberian in the prison.
    <br>So what he had to do was to lie that he was a Nigerian
    <br>so that he could come with the Nigerian people.
    <br>That is why he is in Nigeria today.
    <br>Mr Washington
    <br>Libya Deportee Shares Experience
    <br>So he said because of what he has been hearing
    <br>how the man of God has been helping people,
    <br>he believed that if he came to Nigeria,
    <br>God would use the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to help him get back to Liberia.
    <br>While in the prison, my Nigerian friend told me that if I was not careful, I would fail the interview.
    <br>He decided to teach me.
    <br>When they asked me where I came from, I should tell them that I was from Kaduna State.
    <br>When they asked me about the local government, I should tell them it was Sanga.
    <br>He wrote it on a piece of paper and I practised it.
    <br>When I sat for the first test, I failed in the first test; I was the third person.
    <br>They now gave me number 50; I went all the way back.
    <br>I started crying because if I failed the tests,
    <br>if I didn't go back to my country, I would surely die in that prison.
    <br>because I was the only Liberian in that prison; there was no flight to Liberia.
    <br>Even in Libya, I couldn't call Liberia because the call wouldn't go through.
    <br>If I wanted to call my mum, I would call through Guinea
    <br>and tell the person to call my mum. My mum would then call me.
    <br>That's how I used to communicate with my mum.
    <br>He said while in the prison, it was even difficult to call his family in Liberia.
    <br>While others were interviewed, documentations were done
    <br>and they were deported to their country, he faced a lot of challenges.
    <br>He was not a Nigerian and so when he went for the interview,
    <br>he was not able to say the right thing.
    <br>But there was a Nigerian brother that was teaching him what to say -
    <br>from this State and local government - but each time he would fail.
    <br>So they were taking him back into the prison again
    <br>where he would start crying and begging them so they gave him another chance.
    <br>Then he was able to scale through the interview and got the documents to come to Nigeria.
    <br>How long did you spend over there in Libya?
    <br>I spent eight months in prison.
    <br>The whole time I was in Libya, I was in prison throughout; I never came out.
    <br>And you couldn't get to your destination, Europe?
    <br>Yes, I couldn't get to my destination.
    <br>So what advice do you have for people who are listening to you now?
    <br>Youngsters all over the place, in every country, what advice do you have for them?
    <br>The advice I have for my friends all over the world is
    <br>that you should never use this route to go anywhere.
    <br>Don't let anyone fool you on Facebook that so and so thing is going on,
    <br>I want you to come to so and so place.
    <br>If you don't have the money to fly to a country, don't use the desert road to go anywhere;
    <br>don't use the sea route to go anywhere.
    <br>Okay, so our brother is advising everyone, especially the youth,
    <br>that if you want to travel, travel through the right channel, through legal means.
    <br>Don't go by an illegal route, don't allow anyone to lure or deceive you
    <br>that everything would be fine.
    <br>He is coming from there and nothing is actually fine.
    <br>It is a regrettable journey; he doesn't want anyone to experience what he has experienced.
    <br>So what do you want now? You are now in Nigeria, what exactly do you want?
    <br>I even came without clothing and the man of God gave me clothes, food and shelter.
    <br>Okay. You heard from the brother. He said he came with nothing
    <br>and the man of God gave him money to get clothes, send him for medical treatment,
    <br>before he now came to share this experience today.
    <br>So, what do you want now?
    <br>I want to tell the man of God to please help me and send me back to my country.
    <br>That is all that I want from him, I want to go back to my country.
    <br>I miss my people so much.
    <br>So you are begging to go back to your country now?
    <br>I want to go back, I really want to go back.
    <br>Okay, that is a lesson for everyone that no matter how bad your country is,
    <br>the situation of your county is, home is home and there is no place like home.
    <br>He has gone on the journey, just like others.
    <br>They have experienced the other side of other countries.
    <br>Now, they begged to come back to their country and are appreciating their country better.
    <br>For God Almighty to bring you back safely, we believe He has a plan for your life.
    <br>All the experiences you have passed
    <br> through is to help you for your future. Amen!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>My name is Danazumi.
    <br>I am one of the thousand immigrants that were deported from Libya.
    <br>On going to Libya, there were about 50 cars carrying us through the desert.
    <br>On the way, many people died and some fainted.
    <br>There was no food and water in the desert - for many days, about one month.
    <br>Some people spent one month, some several weeks and some about seven days in the desert.
    <br>In Libya, we were arrested by some men who used us to look for money.
    <br>They asked us to call our parents to pay some ransom.
    <br>We called our parents with their phone.
    <br>I called my parents and told them that I was kidnapped by some men
    <br>and they asked me to pay the sum of 700,000 Naira.
    <br>My mum shouted, "Where do you expect me to get that amount of money from?
    <br>Did you tell me that you were travelling?"
    <br>I said, "That is not the question now.
    <br>The question is: How am I going to leave from here?"
    <br>She then told me, "I have nothing to do. I will not kill myself because of you".
    <br>She was angry, so, I began to plead with her, "I beg, please help me in this situation".
    <br>She thought that I was lying.
    <br>The day when she saw me that I was being hanged, 
    <br>which is called 'monkey hanging' -
    <br>they called her through video call, they were videoing me, beating me -
    <br>she began to cry on the phone, saying, "What is she going to do?"
    <br>I told her to run around and maybe sell the plot of land,
    <br>or to do any other thing to raise the money to help me out.
    <br>She did whatever she could and helped me out of there.
    <br>When I got out, I looked for where to hustle to get money to feed
    <br>because I didn't want to call my mother again for money.
    <br>I started working with a man who carried me to work every day and also gave me food.
    <br>He said he would pay me after seven days.
    <br>When the seventh day reached, I went to meet him,
    <br>"I beg, I want to collect the money you said you will pay me".
    <br>He said, "Which money?"
    <br>I thought to myself that if we were in Nigeria, this man would give me the money by force.
    <br>I tried to force him to give me the money.
    <br>The man asked me to wait for him.
    <br>I thought he was going to bring the money.
    <br>He went inside and came out with an AK-47 in his hand.
    <br>I thought to myself that if I ran, he would shoot me,
    <br>so it would be better to wait for him to beat me up.
    <br>The man used the gun and flogged me continuously.
    <br>I was thanking God that the man did not shoot me.
    <br>He beat me to the extent of breaking a bone on my hand.
    <br>He then allowed me and I left that place.
    <br>I went to my friend's place to ask them to help me.
    <br>We have listened to the brother; many of us could not actually understand him.
    <br>He was speaking in pidgin English to express himself very well.
    <br>He said he was one of the people that travelled to Libya through an illegal route.
    <br>Before he left, he never told his mother or any member of his family
    <br>until when he got there, he was kidnapped, put in the cell
    <br>and was asked to pay a ransom of 700,000 Naira.
    <br>He contacted his mother and told her that kidnappers were demanding 700,000 Naira.
    <br>The mother could not afford it and she had sell a plot of land and other things to raise the money.
    <br>After he was released from the prison, he went out and got someone who offered him a job.
    <br>He would be paying him after every seven days.
    <br>After working for seven days, he went to the man and demanded his money.
    <br>The man asked him, "What money? Which money are you talking about?"
    <br>He told the man, "But our agreement was that you would pay me after seven days".
    <br>The man told him, "Ok, wait for me".
    <br>He said that he was trying to be stubborn to the man; he thought he was in his country.
    <br>But before he knew, it was too late.
    <br>When the man went in, he thought the man was going to bring the money to pay him.
    <br>Rather, the man brought out an AK-47 rifle.
    <br>He couldn't run because he believed that the man was going to shoot him.
    <br>So he waited and the man used the AK-47 to hit him.
    <br>That was how he sustained this broken arm.
    <br>I went home to meet my friends and told them
    <br>that I want to go to the hospital to get treatment.
    <br>My friend asked me, "Do you know where you are?
    <br>Do you have anything to go to the hospital with?
    <br>You cannot go to the hospital in this country.
    <br>We will help you to tie the hand; you will carry it like that".
    <br>That is how they tied the hand and I was in that condition for almost seven months.
    <br>I was going up and down with this hand, looking for a way to go back to my country
    <br>or go further to get treatment for the hand.
    <br>There was no solution until I was arrested.
    <br>Okay, can you tell us what advice you have for people who are listening to you now?
    <br>Remember, you left your country hale and hearty
    <br>and now you are back with a broken arm and a terrible experience over there.
    <br>What advice do you have for people, especially the youth?
    <br>My advice to everyone watching me now is that
    <br>you can see that I have come back with a broken arm
    <br>with nothing - all the money was being wasted.
    <br>They should be careful with the kind of friends they mingle with.
    <br>Parents should take good care of their children
    <br>and find out what they are doing - whether it is right or wrong.
    <br>They should be careful of the lies people tell them about this journey,
    <br>"In two or three days, you are going to be there".
    <br>They are telling you lies, just to collect money.
    <br>No one should embark on this journey because it is very deadly.
    <br>Many people die on the sea and on the land.
    <br>I want to advise them to always stay in their country to hustle.
    <br>I believe that one day God will make a way
    <br>and God will bless them and they will become something in life.
    <br>Our brothers and sisters who have come today to share their experiences,
    <br>as we can see, they are in helpless need of assistance to be able to start life again.
    <br>In view of this, the anointed man of God says help is the best investment.
    <br>We should make a tangible contribution to the life of others.
    <br>With the support of the Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua has asked us to give
    <br>the sum of 200,000 Naira to each of our brothers and sisters here.
    <br>Libya Deportees Each Receive 200,000 Naira
    <br>From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>That is the sum of 200,000 Naira cash each,
    <br>and 'The Mirror' book offered by the anointed man of God for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Remember that whatever the man of God does is for the salvation of souls
    <br>so that they can go back and make something meaningful with their lives.
    <br>They can get into a business, trade, and be able to get back on their feet again
    <br>and never think of going through this kind of journey again.
    <br>Libya Deportees Each Receive 200,000 Naira
    <br>From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Before we hear from them, we also want to inform our Liberian brother
    <br>that since he is looking for assistance to go back to his country,
    <br>we are here to announce to you that the ministry will assist you to get all the documents,
    <br>flight and everything to get back to your country, Liberia.
    <br>Thank you so much, Man of God.
    <br>God will bless you for helping us and for changing our lives.
    <br>God will continue to protect you.
    <br>Your pockets shall never be dry, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank you, Man of God, for changing my life.
    <br>I am very happy. I am the happiest person today.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God! God will give you more wisdom and anointing, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank you, Man of God, for wiping away our tears.
    <br>Thank you for helping us.
    <br>May the Lord continue to increase your wisdom.
    <br>May God continue to bless you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>We also want to encourage you now that you have received this assistance
    <br>to make things easy for you to be able to start life anew,
    <br>all you need to do is to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Anywhere you go, please take time out to advise people not to go on this illegal journey.
    <br>If anyone wants to travel outside the country for a good purpose,
    <br>they should wait for God's time and go through the right channel.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the grace
    <br>to make the best use of the resources you have received,
    <br>and God Almighty who has provided this will continue the supply, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>After listening to their complaints in regards to their health, the Libya Deportees received prayer
    <br>in the power of the Holy Spirit for healing and deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let's watch.
    <br>Man of God, please, help me.
    <br>I was shot and I have difficulty in walking.

    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free!
    <br>Mr Danazumi
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>My name is Akeem. I am one of the thousands that were deported.
    <br>I came back with a broken hand.
    <br>But since the man of God prayed for me, I received my healing.
    <br>Now I can move my hand and use it to eat.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>After listening to Mr Washington's situation, Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>helped him with all the necessary documents to travel back to his country, Liberia,
    <br>including the flight ticket and also the sum of $1,000 USD so that he can start his life afresh in Liberia.
    <br>Let's watch.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Washington, I'm a Liberian.
    <br>I am one of the deportees from Libya.
    <br>There was no flight from Libya to my country,
    <br>so I decided to lie to the people that I am from Nigeria.
    <br>That's why they brought me to Nigeria.
    <br>I'm appealing to the man of God to send me back to my country.
    <br>I came without any documents.
    <br>I don't have a passport, identity card or identity document.
    <br>I'm appealing to the man of God to help me, to send me back to my country.
    <br>I can't stay in Nigeria because I am not from Nigeria.
    <br>We have heard from the young man.
    <br>He's a Liberian and he finds himself in Nigeria because he had to be deported
    <br>with other Nigerian Libyan deportees because he couldn't go back to his country, Liberia.
    <br>Now, he is stranded in Nigeria because he has no money to transport himself back to Liberia
    <br>and he doesn't have any travelling document - no passport, nothing.
    <br>He didn't even have clothes when he came.
    <br>It was the man of God that provided clothing, feeding and accommodation for him
    <br>ever since last week when they were deported from Libya.
    <br>We can see you holding a document. 
    <br>What document is this?
    <br>This is the document they used to deport me from Libya to Nigeria.
    <br>This is the document that Mr Washington received after claiming that he was a Nigerian,
    <br>so that they would deport him out of Libya.
    <br>The anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua is aware of your case
    <br>and he has also responded promptly.
    <br>He has made all the necessary travelling documents available for you
    <br>to be able to travel back to your country, Liberia.
    <br>These include the police report, affidavit, travelling documents
    <br>and your flight ticket to go back to Liberia.
    <br>These are all the documents and all the expenses have been paid by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Here is your main travelling document which replaces your passport.
    <br>With this you can travel back to your country, Liberia.
    <br>This is your flight ticket back to Liberia.
    <br>This is the affidavit.
    <br>Lastly, we have the Nigerian police report.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Mr Washington has received all the necessary documents as well as the flight ticket
    <br>that would enable him to travel legally and freely back to Liberia.
    <br>In addition to the travel documents that have been procured by Prophet T.B. Joshua - all expenses paid -
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, with the support of the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>has also decided to bless you with a cash gift so that when you get back to your country, Liberia
    <br>you would not have to start going around on the street or engaging yourself in any activities
    <br>that would not make you useful to the society.
    <br>The man of God has therefore asked us to give you this sum of $1000 USD.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Thank you so much, Man of God. May God bless you.
    <br>I am so happy for that. Thank you so much.
    <br>God bless you. God bless the ministry.
    <br>God bless everyone, God bless all the members of the church.
    <br>Thank you so much, Man of God.
    <br>Mr Washington Receives All The Necessary Documents, Flight Ticket To Liberia And $1000 USD To Start A New Life
