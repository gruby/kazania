    <br>Right now, I can see that trouble in your system.
    <br>I am saying to that infirmity in your system, in your bones, in your blood, in your kidney, in your liver,
    <br>in your muscles, out!
    <br>I say I can see them coming out; your sickness is coming out, your disease is coming out.
    <br>It is coming out, in your blood! It is coming out, in your kidney!
    <br>It is coming out, in your liver! It is coming out! I say, out!
    <br>Confess, "Out"!
    <br>You disease, you sickness, out. In my liver, tendons, blood, muscles, out!
    <br>In my kidney, blood, womb, out!
    <br>Confess, out! - in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Say, out!
    <br>I can see them out. Disease, out!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua. 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith in Jesus' Name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, the way out for your career has come - rejoice.
    <br>The way out for your finances, business, has come - rejoice.
    <br>The way out has come - rejoice.
    <br>Confess, "Has come." Say, "Has come,  in the name of Jesus."
    <br>Say, "The way out for me has come!"
    <br>Rejoice, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>The way out for me has come.
    <br>Begin to rejoice, in the name of Jesus.
