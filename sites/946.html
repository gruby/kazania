  <p>    
    <br>Madam, how are you?
    <br>You have the spirit of suicide.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You want to commit suicide.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You have depression - serious depression
    <br>Yes, serious depression.
    <br>Three times you attempted to commit suicide.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Your family serves gods.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Strong gods. They serve gods.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Why do you want to commit suicide?
    <br>Because I was depressed and encountered a lot of difficulties in my life
    <br>and I just felt that there are times I cannot cope.
    <br>I feel that many people are against me and I don't know them at all.
    <br>But I really feel that they are against me, and I also don't know why.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>I command every spirit and I command them out in the name of Jesus -
    <br>the spirit of suicide and depression caused by generational curses.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>She is free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Evelyn and I come from Malaysia.
    <br>Last week, the man of God prophesied to me that I had the spirit of committing suicide,
    <br>serious depression and that my family serves gods.
    <br>They are taoists. They worship three idols at my house and they are conventional Chinese gods.
    <br>The name of the god is ... and another one is ancestral spirit.
    <br>Another one is the god of lands.
    <br>I was brought up worshipping these gods from when I was very young.
    <br>I would burn incense and offer it to these gods.
    <br>I would offer a sacrifice like roasted chicken, vegetables and also fruits to the idols.
    <br>Exactly as Prophet T.B. Joshua said that there were some gods that our sister's family worshipped
    <br>She's explaining that right from a young age, she was brought up worshiping three different gods
    <br>and making sacrifices to them. Now tell us - as you were growing up,
    <br>how did this begin to affect your life negatively?
    <br>I have been suffering from depression for many years.
    <br>I have always been wanting to commit suicide.
    <br>There is one time that I almost wanted to go and jump off from a ten to twenty storey building in Singapore.
    <br>There are many times that I tried to kill myself with a knive and get hit by a car.
    <br>What was it that was pushing you to attempt suicide?
    <br>I kept on hearing voices that I'm a useless person.
    <br>I might just as well die. That there was no hope and nothing inside of me.
    <br>I did not possess anything. I had no career and no marriage. I should just go and die.
    <br>So you would hear these voices talking to you, pushing you into attempting suicide.
    <br>You said that you've attempted suicide on many occasions.
    <br>Yes, on many occasions.
    <br>Whenever I was at home or at work, the thoughts would just come that I should commit suicide.
    <br>You mentioned depression as well.
    <br>How did that depression - apart from pushing you to attempt suicide - affect you
    <br>in your relationships and work? How did that depression really affect?
    <br>It lead to failure in my career.
    <br>Many times I had to resign from my work.
    <br>I also did not have a good relationship with other people.
    <br>So the depression really made me to face a lot of difficulties in my life.
    <br>But thank God that I was delivered and I'm delivered.
    <br>Hallelujah! Now before talking about your deliverance, we want to find out -
    <br>how did you come to find out about The SCOAN and Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>You said you came all the way from Malaysia, Asia, to be here.
    <br>How did you initially discover this ministry?
    <br>When I was a buddhist 14 years ago, at the age of 16,
    <br>I had a friend who is a Christian.
    <br>She gave me a CD of this ministry, of Prophet T.B. Joshua performing miracles.
    <br>God is performing miracles through the man of God.
    <br>There are many healings and miracles that I witnessed with my own eyes through the CD.
    <br>At that time I did not commit myself to Christ.
    <br>I just wondered, "Wow, such miracles!
    <br>There is really a God in this world!" But I was a Buddhist at that time.
    <br>After I witnessed these miracles, I started to believe that there is a God in this world
    <br>and I asked my Christian friends to take me to church.
    <br>Eventually, I became a Christian after witnessing the works of the man of God.
    <br>14 years ago, someone gave you a CD which contained clips from this ministry, The SCOAN.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Wow! So we can just imagine what our sister is saying -
    <br>right there in Malaysia, she actually saw the video clips of this ministry 14 years ago.
    <br>At that time, she had another faith; she was not a Christian.
    <br>But the miracles she saw actually convinced her that Jesus Christ was alive
    <br>and that led her to the point of becoming a Christian later on.
    <br>So tell us - how did you now come to be here today?
    <br>I've been trying to come here for many times but I was always facing difficulties,
    <br>like "Oh, never mind! You don't need to come!"
    <br>"You don't have the money to book the flight ticket' or "Never mind, you just sit at home
    <br>and you can watch the screen". But at one point in time before I came, I had a dream.
    <br>I saw the man of God. He prophesied to me, and he delivered me.
    <br>So this was my decision to eventually come here.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So even before physically coming to The SCOAN, you saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in a dream
    <br>and God used him to prophesy and to deliver you.
    <br>When you finally came, tell us - what happened to you last week?
    <br>When he prophesied and prayed for me, I felt that...
    <br>When he touched me, I thought there was lightning and a bolt that struck my head
    <br>and then immediately I fell down.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So the exact problem you came all the way from Malaysia with, was this spirit of suicide,
    <br>this spirit of depression. The man of God walked up to you and gave you that exact prophecy -
    <br>exactly as you'd seen happen in your dream, even before coming here.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And then he prayed for you. Now ever since the prayer you received, just tell us what has happened to your life.
    <br>Ever since last week that the man of God prophesied to me, I have no thoughts of committing suicide at all.
    <br>Even when I feel bad at times, I no longer have thoughts of committing suicide at all.
    <br>Thank God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Apart from suicidal thoughts that have gone, how have you been relating with others?
    <br>You said before that you were always depressed but since that deliverance last week,
    <br>how has your life been?
    <br>I've become happier, and I do not hold grudges towards other people.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. This is the evidence of the deliverance that our sister received last week.
    <br>We can see on the screen how she received that word of prophecy -
    <br>the exact problem she came here all the way from Malaysia with.
    <br>We give glory to God that she's here as a living testimony today
    <br>because this issue of committing suicide and depression is a problem that so many people,
    <br>especially young people all over the world, are suffering from.
    <br>Our sister had that problem before. She said that she had attempted suicide so many times,
    <br>to the point of even trying to jump off a 20-storey building but today she is delivered.
    <br>We want to ask you sister: What is your advice to people out there who also have that same problem?
    <br>They're depressed. They're feeling of committing suicide, attempting suicide.
    <br>What do you want to advise them based on your own deliverance?
    <br>Depression comes from holding a grudge towards others.
    <br>So my advice is: Do not hold a grudge towards your neighbours or your enemies.
    <br>Love your neighbours and your enemies and pray for them.
    <br>Then you won't be committing suicide, you won't have the thoughts of committing suicide anymore.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sister, you said before that you were hearing a voice that was speaking to you,
    <br>always pushing you to attempt suicide, to kill yourself, to end it all.
    <br>Just describe - since your deliverance last week,
    <br>what are the changes you've experienced in your mind, in your heart now concerning that voice?
    <br>I don't hear any voice that asks me to commit suicide anymore.
    <br>Instead I hear voices of encouraging me in prayer and in loving others.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is the evidence of our sister's deliverance that spirits that were pushing her to commit suicide,
    <br>that had entered her right from a young age as a result of the gods that her family worshipped
    <br>left her after the deliverance and today, we thank God that she's free
    <br>and no longer has any thoughts of committing suicide.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So right now sister, what is your advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My advice is: Get used to challenges.
    <br>God has not promised that we as Christians will not encounter challenges
    <br>but the way that we handle the challenges will determine our future.
    <br>Love your neighbours and love your enemies as yourself,
    <br>and there will always be hope in you in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Amen.  Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
