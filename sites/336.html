    <br>Do you mean to say she has been using this since birth because she could not walk straight?
    <br>Colombia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>She had been using orthopaedic shoes and had been wearing these leg braces for six months.

    <br>Please tell us how she was walking before.

    <br>Her left leg was facing inwards, so she could not walk properly.
    <br>When she would walk down a staircase, she would walk like this.

    <br>What did the doctor say about her condition?
    <br>The doctor sent her for therapy and gave her this leg brace.
    <br>We had to wait to see if she improved; if not, she would have to do an operation.
