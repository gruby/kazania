    <br>EMMANUEL TV ALBANIA OUTREACH DURING VIRUS LOCKDOWN
    <br>In a world that cares less,
    <br>we should care more.
    <br>Everyone has something big or small to plant.
    <br>We should see giving as an
    <br>assignment from God.
    <br>Everything we have today,
    <br>comes from God.
    <br>Whatever blessing God has given us is
    <br>meant to be replanted,
    <br>for a bigger harvest.
    <br>Help for God's sake and be helped.
    <br>Love for God's sake and be loved.
    <br>Care for God's sake and be cared for.
    <br>Jesus values our little effort.

    <br>Hello, friends! We are here in

    <br>For four weeks, there has been a lockdown.
    <br>People cannot work, so they don't have
    <br>money to buy food.
    <br>Thank you very much, brothers
    <br>and sisters from Nigeria
    <br>for supporting us with these food packages.
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>We have taken permission from the Government
    <br>to visit people and give them food.
    <br>This will be an act of love.
    <br>Thank you very much.
