  <p>    
    <br>As wiseman Racine moves through The SCOAN's congregation,
    <br>praying for people in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>he encounters an unclean spirit in the life of this woman.
    <br>Let's watch to see how she receives her deliverance.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Spirit of snake - python.
    <br>How do you operate in her life? Speak!
    <br>- I operate in so many ways.
    <br>- In which ways? Explain.
    <br>I caused her to divorce.
    <br>She was married. I gave her the spirit of anger.
    <br>That anger caused her to divorce her husband.
    <br>He left her with one daughter who she's taking care of.
    <br>I cause her to steal.
    <br>She has a career.
    <br>She works in a salon but I don't allow her to do that job.
    <br>I cause her to steal.
    <br>She just came from South Africa.
    <br>How do you force her to steal?
    <br>Ever since she divorced the husband, he is no longer taking care of the baby.
    <br>So, she has nothing else to do but steal and provide for the child.
    <br>How does she manage to steal? 
    <br>Explain.
    <br>- How do I do?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>We do 419.
    <br>Example, maybe I am a woman and I go into the streets; anyone can see me and like me.
    <br>Then, I would just lie to them and tell them that I had come with money from my country.
    <br>I would tell them that my country had been fighting;
    <br>I was able to come with some of the money, that if they could help me to
    <br>take my luggage from the port, I could share my money with them and invest in the country.
    <br>What else have you done to her life?
    <br>She doesn't have a career.
    <br>I caused her not to further her education.
    <br>The only career she knows is to do hair but I don't allow her to do the salon business.
    <br>You say you are a snake. How many demonic powers do you have?
    <br>Five.
    <br>Name them. Number one:
    <br>1. I gave her the spirit of anger.
    <br>2. She has a moving object, moving all over her body.
    <br>From her legs to her head, there is something like snakes, moving all over.
    <br>I cause her body to itch; I gave her the spirit of itching.
    <br>She itches from her hands to her private parts, all over her body.
    <br>I gave her the spirit of dog.
    <br>Dogs are always biting her.
    <br>Her family are not stable.
    <br>Her brother smokes drugs.
    <br>How does the spirit of dog manifest?
    <br>The spirit of dog gave her the spirit of anger.
    <br>When she fights, she scratches you and damages your body like dogs.
    <br>How many people have you fought like that?
    <br>So many people.
    <br>So many friends.
    <br>What have you done to her family?
    <br>The family is useless.
    <br>They are not doing anything.
    <br>The mother is a strong woman but she suffers and doesn't get anywhere.
    <br>I caused her brother to smoke drugs.
    <br>If he comes here, you would smell him.
    <br>I caused him to destroy the family.
    <br>Whenever the mother tries to raise money to do something,
    <br>I use him to steal everything and destroy.
    <br>I caused it.
    <br>What do you do to the men who approach her?
    <br>The men that come her way...
    <br>I will cause them to fall in love with her and promise her marriage,
    <br>that they would do this and that.
    <br>After spoiling everything, I will cause him to get angry and hate her
    <br>and see her as someone who is ugly, as if she doesn't exist.
    <br>I love her and want her to be my wife.
    <br>I don't want her to get married.
    <br>She was the only person to get married.
    <br>This girl was very stubborn.
    <br>In the whole family, no one had ever wedded.
    <br>She was the only one who got married.
    <br>She had a white wedding.
    <br>There was a day she called the ex-husband who had gone to France.
    <br>After she called him, asking for support for the child, the husband started arguing
    <br>and she said, "OK, I need a divorce."
    <br>So, she went to where they got married and asked for a divorce.
    <br>She divorced the husband on the phone.
    <br>I caused it.
    <br>Now, she is useless.
    <br>Look here. Who is this man on your right?
    <br>Partner in crime.
    <br>What do you mean? Explain.
    <br>Partner in the 419 business.
    <br>I don't know him.
    <br>We just steal together.
    <br>Sir, who is this woman?
    <br>I met her in South Africa about a year ago.
    <br>What can you say about the confession she is making?
    <br>The confession she is making is true.
    <br>I have been doing dubious business for the past 18 years.
    <br>I am from Liberia but because of the war in my country,
    <br>I left and went to school in Ghana where I was with my parents.
    <br>I am from a poor family.
    <br>I met some friends who taught me how to do this 419 business.
    <br>I have been going all around the world, in Europe, Asia
    <br>and whatever part of the world I travel to.
    <br>I met this lady when I had just come back from Tanzania in 2012.
    <br>We met in Durban.
    <br>She was going through a very hard situation.
    <br>I was helping her.
    <br>The condition of her life was not good then.
    <br>I travelled to Liberia when my father passed away and I took her along.
    <br>I have also been doing 419.
    <br>But I have my career.
    <br>I went to school but I don't work because of the life I have been living.
    <br>You, demon, how did you enter her?
    <br>I entered her from the day she was born.
    <br>The father was looking for children after so many years.
    <br>The father visited somewhere and that was how he was able to get children.
    <br>Since then, the father made a vow to me.
    <br>They are all useless.
    <br>I am the cause of barrenness and divorce in the family.
    <br>Even her mother left her father.
    <br>There are four of them whom the mother raised.
    <br>In that particular family, they are not allowed to get married or have a stable home.
    <br>Their whole life should be useless.
    <br>- Who is the cause of that?
    <br>- Me.
    <br>- You?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>The spirit of python. Me.
    <br>You, move like a python, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>You, spirit of snake, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, move out of this body.
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost, fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Be cast out you demon, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Come out you snake.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Move out of this body now, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Out, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come. What happened to you?
    <br>- What happened to you?
    <br>- I don't know.
    <br>- You found yourself on the floor.
    <br>- I don't know.
    <br>- Do you remember what you have said?
    <br>- No.
    <br>You said you were a snake.
    <br>I am not a snake.
    <br>- Who is this man?
    <br>- He is my fiance.
    <br>Your fiance.
    <br>That evil spirit that used to use her to do all those evil things; Jesus has cast it out.
    <br>She is a free person.
    <br>- You are free and you should follow Jesus.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Never you remind her of her past; her past is over.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free!
    <br>In a subsequent service, the woman's fiance attended The SCOAN prayer line.
    <br>Wiseman Racine was praying for people, in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>commanding sicknesses, afflictions and unclean spirits to go out.
    <br>He came to the place where the fiance was standing, awaiting prayer.
    <br>As he prayed for the fiance in the name of Jesus Christ,  the demon in his life was exposed.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I destroyed his career and caused him to be stealing.
    <br>Nothing he does prospers.
    <br>I want to destroy him. Leave him!
    <br>He belongs to me.
    <br>Leave him!
    <br>I don't know why he came here.
    <br>What brought him here?
    <br>I asked him not to come here.
    <br>Why do you want to deliver this boy?
    <br>You say you caused him to steal.
    <br>Explain - how?
    <br>I cause him to travel from one nation to another, thinking that he is important.
    <br>He meets great people and gets money from them but he misuses it.
    <br>How do you get money from them?
    <br>He lies to them that he has money.
    <br>He gives them papers, making them to believe he has a lot of money.
    <br>They will give him a lot of money and he will misuse it.
    <br>I make his life useless.
    <br>I want to destroy him.
    <br>From poverty, I made his father to become nothing.
    <br>His sisters and brothers are all educated but they are nothing.
    <br>There is no unity in the family.
    <br>Leave him!
    <br>I want to destroy this family.
    <br>How many demonic powers do you have?
    <br>The powers of hatred and stealing.
    <br>The mother prays a lot but is saying nothing.
    <br>I have initiated the younger brother into a spiritual cult.
    <br>Let him be. I don't know what brought this boy here.
    <br>I need him.
    <br>He is mine.
    <br>You say you caused him to do many illegal activities. Explain more.
    <br>I made him a soldier at the age of 12 and I destroyed his future.
    <br>I was supposed to kill this boy in his country many years ago
    <br>but his mother is very strong in praying.
    <br>That is why he still has life.
    <br>I succeeded in taking the father away but the mother is still praying.
    <br>Leave this family. I want to destroy them.
    <br>They are mine.
    <br>Look here; who is this woman?
    <br>Look towards your left.
    <br>I have destroyed this woman.
    <br>- Who is this woman?
    <br>- I have destroyed her.
    <br>She is his wife but I destroyed her.
    <br>I caused him to hate her.
    <br>He doesn't love her.
    <br>Sister, what can you say about what he said?
    <br>Everything he said is true.
    <br>- Who is this man to you?
    <br>- He is my fiance.
    <br>What can you say about his confession?
    <br>His confession is true.
    <br>He fought the war and raped.
    <br>And he is into fraud.
    <br>We were doing it together - two of us.
    <br>- How did you enter him?
    <br>- I entered him when he was born.
    <br>After seven years his father was building the house,
    <br>and then his father wanted the house to be initiated.
    <br>His father brought a medicine man who initiated the whole family.
    <br>How many demonic powers do you have?
    <br>I have so many powers.
    <br>I have the power of stealing and convincing people.
    <br>Nothing can be better for him.
    <br>I want to destroy him.
    <br>You, demon, how do you operate?
    <br>I operate through being 'clean', making him to think that he is the best.
    <br>I give him knowledge which is not from God; it is evil knowledge.
    <br>That is why he cannot work.
    <br>Which kind of evil knowledge?
    <br>Explain.
    <br>He plans evil.
    <br>Sometimes, he is a very good man but whenever he does good, people think he is evil.
    <br>I have made all his good to be nothing.
    <br>I want him to be nothing.
    <br>Enough is enough.
    <br>You demon, unclean spirit, in the mighty name of Jesus,
    <br>come out, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Be free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come. Where are you going?
    <br>Come brother, come.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Why are you hiding?
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I don't know where I was.
    <br>I don't know what happened.
    <br>- This woman - who is she to you?
    <br>- She is my fiancee.
    <br>- Do you remember what you have said?
    <br>- No.
    <br>That unclean spirit that wanted to destroy your destiny and your life;
    <br>today, Jesus has cast it out.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My fiance is free!
    <br>He is free. Never you remind him of his past.
    <br>His past is over, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We are delivered!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We are free.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I am Taneh Seih from Monrovia, Liberia.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my fiance.
    <br>He used to be my partner in crime.
    <br>It all started when I was nine years old back home in Liberia.
    <br>I used to hear this voice calling me from the river
    <br>because where my mother's house is there is a river there.
    <br>This voice used to call me from the river and it would be calling my name,
    <br>"Taneh! Taneh! Taneh!" like three times.
    <br>I would be in deep sleep but I would just wake up and walk straight to the river.
    <br>After trying to get into the river, people would catch me and bring me home.
    <br>My mother took me to a lot of spiritualists, which were supposed to help me
    <br>kill that problem but nothing worked.
    <br>After the spirit tormented me, it caused me not to stay at home.
    <br>I used to love being in the street, sleeping with lots of men, series of men.
    <br>I was here today, tomorrow I would be in Sierra Leone, the next day, I was in another place.
    <br>I was all over the place because of this spirit.
    <br>The spirit really destroyed my life.
    <br>There was this day that I came from Sierra Leone, I only spent two days in Liberia
    <br>then I boarded a ship to come to Nigeria.
    <br>When I came to Nigeria, I stayed nearly three years
    <br>and I was still doing that useless, baseless life of sleeping around with men.
    <br>I dated a series of men, a lot of men, married men and men that were into fraud.
    <br>That was how I started to sleep with some of them.
    <br>They became like my brothers and I got to learn the fraud business.
    <br>This fraud business even took me to Libya.
    <br>I went to a lot of countries.
    <br>The first place I took money from someone was in Libya.
    <br>Whenever you meet a person you wanted to dupe of their money,
    <br>you would tell them where you were from because my country was fighting at that time.
    <br>I would tell them that I was from Liberia and my father was a general or governor.
    <br>I would always look for someone that was having a bigger position than me
    <br>so that when they hear your story they would be able to listen to your story
    <br>because they thought you were very rich.
    <br>I told them that my father was the governor before and
    <br>the money that I had brought into this country, Libya was my father's money
    <br>it was the money that my father had willed to us.
    <br>I would like to invest or open a franchise or a petrol station.
    <br>Since last Sunday you are delivered.
    <br>Tell me how life has been after your deliverance.
    <br>Since my deliverance, life has changed.
    <br>- Your thoughts?
    <br>- My thoughts were different.
    <br>I didn't steal or desire to rob anyone of their money.
    <br>I don't have that feeling anymore, that feeling is gone from me.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Michael Freeman from Liberia.
    <br>The lady beside me is my fiancee.
    <br>In the past, I was seven years old, my grandfather initiated us into this cult.
    <br>My father built a house, that was in the 1970's when I was seven years old.
    <br>My father was from a Muslim background and my mum was Christian.
    <br>So, we got initiated and there was a mark placed on my arm.
    <br>After then, I became a very wayward badboy.
    <br>I stole a lot; I stole my father's money and whatever was in the house that was his.
    <br>Then, in 1989, when the war came, I was just 12 years old then.
    <br>I was recruited as a child soldier and then initiated into another cult
    <br>because I could not be a child soldier without being initiated into
    <br>a blood covenant to start fighting.
    <br>I was previously initiated by killing someone with a gun.
    <br>I was trained by special forces from other African countries.
    <br>In that process, I started killing.
    <br>We killed so many people, we raped and smoked drugs at the age of 12.
    <br>That was until 1994, when I was 16, my mother kept coming to speak to
    <br>the leaders of my group to tell them to let me go because
    <br>I had the opportunity to go to the United States.
    <br>Upon that, they accepted to let me go and I moved to Ghana but before that
    <br>I had already been taught by special forces the methods of duping people.
    <br>Before we became a child soldier we were in a revolution.
    <br>We had to be taught so that in case in the war we were fighting backfired,
    <br>how we could escape the country to other various countries
    <br>and we could establish ourselves there.
    <br>We want to know whether those spirits are still tormenting you,
    <br>and how are you feeling now.
    <br>Since my deliverance, those spirits are no longer coming but beforehand,
    <br>the spirit was disturbing me too much.
    <br>I had the urge to do whatever I wanted to do
    <br>until I came in contact with Emmanuel TV a year ago.
    <br>Then, I was arrested and it drove me to come here.
    <br>That was how I came and got my deliverance but before that
    <br>I had been tormented in so many ways.
    <br>I saw people fighting, shooting me in my dreams and spirits were after me.
    <br>Nothing I did prospered until I came here and got my deliverance.
    <br>What are you people doing now?
    <br>Where are you going when you leave here?
    <br>You came from where?
    <br>I came from South Africa to here and now I am going to Liberia.
    <br>For how many years were you outside Liberia?
    <br>I left Liberia since 1994, that is 19 years now.
    <br>So you are just going there now?
    <br>Yes, I am just going home now.
    <br>Wow. And you don't have anything you are going to do there?
    <br>Yes, I don't have anything I am going to do there.
    <br>I just decided to come here for my deliverance and go home.
    <br>I am a college drop out, I didn't finish my schooling.
    <br>I need to continue my study and I will need help from the man of God
    <br>to help me continue in my study from where I stopped.
    <br>Where are your parents?
    <br>My father passed away five months ago and my mother is a widow in Liberia now.
    <br>She is at home with my siblings.
    <br>My mum is at home with my sisters.
    <br>Even me, I don't have anything to do because we just went home about
    <br>two weeks before we came here.
    <br>I stayed about 15 years outside Liberia.
    <br>How did you come to Lagos?
    <br>Where did you get the flight ticket?
    <br>They gave him his father's pension money.
    <br>That was how we transported ourselves here.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>No problem; we will talk.
    <br>We still need to counsel ourselves.
    <br>They will stay with us till next Sunday; you will hear from them.
    <br>Thank you; you are my guests.
