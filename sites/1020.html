  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>I want to believe we are here to sow to the Spirit.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Each time we listen to the Word of God, there is a passage there that I love so much.
    <br>“You are already cleansed because of the Word which I have spoken to you.” John 15:3
    <br>After listening to the Word of God, can we say, "You are free"?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are still living in the past, you are taking journeys to yesterday.
    <br>The Word of God helps us to stop reliving the past in our present life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “The Word of God helps us to stop reliving...”
    <br>You know what I mean by reliving - the past in our present life.
    <br>When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.
    <br>That is when you know you are already free.
    <br>When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern
    <br>or your behaviours.
    <br>"Yes. How will I pay my school fees? How will I pay my house rent? I'm sick. Somebody sick is in the hospital.
    <br>What is going to happen? How will I get...? I don't know whether I will be paid my salary.
    <br>I don't know what will happen here."
    <br>When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.
    <br>I mean, your behaviours.
    <br>Wherever you are coming from, whatever you have gone through
    <br>before coming here does not matter.
    <br>This is what the Bible means by,
    <br>“You are already cleansed because of the Word I have spoken to you”.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>“When you receive the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.”
    <br>I mean, your behaviours.
    <br>You know, before you came here today, you were so worried, you were thinking how to do this or that,
    <br>"How will I do it? How will I go about it?",
    <br>but after receiving the Word of God you start laughing.
    <br>The pain may be there but yet, the joy has overcome over the shadow.
    <br>You can have the pain and at the same time be happy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “You can have the pain and at the same time be happy”
    <br>because the part that has pain is not yours; it’s not part of you.
    <br>The part that has that pain is not part of you; it’s a shade.
    <br>A cover - you know the snake; snake enters the shade.
    <br>The Lord never consults your past to determine your future.
    <br>He never says, "Oh!"
    <br>If your past was consulted, you would not be here today.
    <br>A lot of things is out there to stop you from coming.
    <br>When you receive that Word...
    <br>The Word has been delivered - we don't know whether you have received the Word.
    <br>Some receive with their ears and some receive with their heart.
    <br>If you have received the Word of God, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.
    <br>The way you think, the manner you think...
    <br>I will bind your feet to the path of righteousness today.
    <br>Rise up; let's start that one first, because what I'm saying looks strange to you,
    <br>"What does this man saying? He says I should not think of where I'm coming from?
    <br>I should not think about my debts?"
    <br>That is the position of faith.
    <br>Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised.
    <br>Right now, begin to bind your feet to the path of righteousness; prayer.
    <br>Bind your feet right now to the path of righteousness because you are made righteous.
    <br>You are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Begin to bind your feet to the path of righteousness.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>- I bind you to the work of the Cross.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Yes; you are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Open your lips and confess this.
    <br>Believe you are bound to the path of righteousness.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You can say, "No", and say "Yes" with an independent mind, that can think, reason...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Be bound to the work of the Cross, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Be bound to the work of the Cross, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>With His mercy, forgiveness and love,
    <br>be bound to the work of the Cross, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Now, you will begin to think differently.
    <br>Begin right now.
    <br>Now you are free, look forward to those things that lie ahead.
    <br>You are to get yourself ready.
    <br>If you have not positioned yourself, God cannot position you.
    <br>Do you listen to me?
    <br>You are to first position yourself for God to position you.
    <br>If you just say, "I'm not interested in what they are talking about", then you have not positioned yourself.
    <br>You are to position yourself for God to position you.
    <br>Believe God is not a man; when He says yes, yes is yes.
    <br>You need to know the power you are under right now.
    <br>You ask yourself, "What power am I under? Am I under man? Am I under T.B. Joshua? Am I under Jesus Christ?"
    <br>You need to know the power you are under.
    <br>The songs says,
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don’t worry yourself
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don’t cry no more
    <br>Jesus is alive
    <br>Praise God
    <br>You can face tomorrow
    <br>He understands
    <br>What you are passing through today
    <br>Let God glorify His name
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>I know this is just a mere song; you sing it every day, "Leave if for God..."
    <br>What are you leaving for God?
    <br>Your worries, your care.
    <br>Are you actually leaving your worries for God?
    <br>We see our faith as a hobby, a game.
    <br>You know; games - we are not serious about games; when it does not go well, we look for another game.
    <br>It is not a hobby; there is no alternative.
    <br>Faith is faith.
    <br>You need to know the difference between your faith and a hobby.
    <br>It is not a hobby, it is not a game that we try and leave.
    <br>No, you can try; you have no alternative.
    <br>You have to be visible and clear.
    <br>If you are not visible and clear, there is no light.
    <br>You have to position yourself for God to position you.
    <br>Where everything is visible and clear, there is light.
    <br>How do we position ourselves?
    <br>You must know the power you are under.
    <br>You must be here by revelation.
    <br>Not by advice; somebody advised you to come here...
    <br>I think you have to be here by revelation.
    <br>Somebody advised you to come here, or you follow a friend here, or you are looking for your boss;
    <br>your boss is a member of this church, you want to go there, so you use that opportunity to see your boss,
    <br>or your friends.
    <br>Your foundation must be revelation.
    <br>God sent His Word to heal His people and His people are products of revelation.
    <br>If you are here not by revelation, you will be just looking at what is happening here,
    <br>"Oh my God, it happened; but it has not happened to me."
    <br>Does it need to happen to you before you believe?
    <br>I think that when it happens to someone and you are looking how it happened,
    <br>that will give you a grace to receive a "mother of miracles".
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That prepares our faith.
    <br>That makes us stronger.
    <br>You have to be tired of reliving the past in your present life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Be tired of reliving the past in your present life.”
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>"Be tired of reliving the past in your present life.”
    <br>You continue to think of what happened to you yesterday;
    <br>you were disappointed yesterday and you believe that today you also must be disappointed.
    <br>Anywhere you go you continue to think about yesterday's disappointment.
    <br>The way somebody, your husband behaved yesterday; you wake up this morning having that attitude -
    <br>you walk towards your husband, "Good morning", believing that he will behave the same way - no!
    <br>Once you are a Christian, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.
    <br>Once you are a Christian and you are delivered, the past will no longer control your thinking pattern.
    <br>I mean, it will no longer control your attitude.
    <br>"I know many things happened to me yesterday - but it was yesterday."
    <br>History; the fact that we didn't make it yesterday makes you believe that you will not make it at all -
    <br>this is the life we live.
    <br>Those processes, thoughts, attitude; an encounter you had yesterday you carry along to process it today.
    <br>It can't work.
    <br>I bind your feet to the path of righteousness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Righteousness exalts
    <br>and you are that righteousness of God.
    <br>Jesus has made you righteous.
    <br>I bind your feet to the righteousness of God, in Jesus Christ’s name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>I bind your feet to the righteousness of God!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Let me see your faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You believe all things pass away, right now?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>You have to be strong; be ready.
    <br>I am just preparing you for the blessing you are about to receive.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You should be talking about maintenance, not blessing.
    <br>Don't talk about blessing; you are blessed already.
    <br>Blessing is a past tense victory; it is a past tense issue.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>What you are waiting for - blessing - is a past tense issue.
    <br>What you should be talking about is maintenance.
    <br>Everything you have been given; there is nothing you are able to maintain - even your children.
    <br>Some of your children today have become enemies; they can insult or embarrass you.
    <br>When you see them you are afraid even to look at their faces, because of the upbringing.
    <br>Many of you cannot even maintain children God had given to you.
    <br>If you give birth to a child, and you can not maintain it, you cannot train it- what else can you teach them?
    <br>There is nothing you can teach, if you cannot teach your children.
    <br>Baby, you have a birth to...
    <br>Right from an embryo... and suddenly he or she becomes big and now can say,
    <br>"- Please! Don't talk to me like that!
    <br>- I'm sorry." That is your baby.
    <br>This is life.
    <br>We are embarrassing ourselves and we think we are embarrassing God.
    <br>Each time you are looking for blessing, "God, bless me!..." - what about the one He has given you?
    <br>Even your little one, baby?
    <br>God rejoices and is happy concerning the way we maintain the blessing given to us.
    <br>How you maintain your blessing will determine how it will increase.
    <br>When you think about many blessings God has given to you, and how you maintained them,
    <br>you will likely not even want to ask God for any blessing, because the one given to you you didn't maintain.
    <br>And you keep asking for more, more, more...
    <br>We are not ashamed.
    <br>Think about maintenance.
    <br>Think about what?
    <br>Maintenance.
    <br>Don’t let the blessing of God control your direction;
    <br>let God who gave you blessing be the Controller.
    <br>Today, it is the blessing God had given to us that is controlling us.
    <br>When money comes, you think it will tell you where to live, what to wear, how to do, how to go to church,
    <br>whether to go to church or not, where to go to church, which kind of church you should go to,
    <br>because of money you have,
    <br>instead of God, who gave you the blessing, to be the Controller.
    <br>This is the maintenance we are talking about.
    <br>"I need healing..." - what about the healing you had in the past?
    <br>"I need money, breakthrough, position..."
    <br>Before, you could have spent five hours in the church; now, you have a big position,
    <br>you became director, MD of the company, you cannot spend two minutes in the church any more.
    <br>When you are going to church, you carry your newspaper along with you, as if it was the Bible.
    <br>These are the things God takes into consideration.
    <br>When God looks at all this, He begins to look at this blessing - we are blessed to bless others,
    <br>but today what has happened?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Think about what?
    <br>Maintenance.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Think about maintenance".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Think about maintenance.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Think about maintenance.
    <br>Even our relationship with a husband or wife; we cannot maintain them.
    <br>Whole thing falls apart.
    <br>We fail to understand that the husband and wife - when God brings them together for the purpose of,
    <br>"where she is strong he is weak, and where she is weak he is strong" - that is the meaning of marriage.
    <br>So, we can counsel ourselves.
