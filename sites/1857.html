    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>What is this inside your stomach?
    <br>It's a baby.
    <br>The man of God prays for this woman in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>I am seeing earrings.
    <br>- Is it man that wears earrings or a woman? 
    <br>- A woman.
    <br>Okay, thank you.
    <br>HEAR WHAT TB JOSHUA SAID ABOUT THIS BABY GIRL!!!
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Ladi Esther Ibrahim.
    <br>I'm from Kogi State, but I live in Abuja.
    <br>The man of God asked me what was in my womb.
    <br>I told him it was a baby.
    <br>He asked me if somebody wore earrings what that would be.
    <br>I said it was a baby girl.
    <br>He said that was it.
    <br>What is this inside your stomach?
    <br>It's a baby.
    <br>I am seeing earrings.
    <br>- Is it a man that wears earrings or a woman? 
    <br>- A woman.
    <br>Okay, thank you.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done in my life today.
    <br>We also thank God for this revelation
    <br>and we know that very soon you'll be here with a bouncing baby to glorify the name of the Lord.
    <br>- So, thank you.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I'm so excited today because what God has done in my life is too much!
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Ibrahim. We come from Abuja.
    <br>I was in the congregation when the man of God came to me
    <br>and prophesied to my life, asking what I was carrying in my womb.
    <br>At that time, what surprised me was that I was about to lose the baby
    <br>by miscarriage before I stepped into this auditorium.
    <br>When I came here, he prophesied.
    <br>After he asked what I was carrying in my womb,
    <br>he asked that if a woman was carrying a child
    <br>and the child was wearing earrings, what does that mean?
    <br>I said that it's a baby girl and he said, thank you.
    <br>What is this inside your stomach?
    <br>It's a baby.
    <br>The man of God prays for this woman in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>I am seeing earrings.
    <br>- Is it a man that wears earrings or a woman? 
    <br>- A woman.
    <br>Okay, thank you.
    <br>On the day of my delivery I was surprised.
    <br>In Abuja that day, they said that they fumigated the hospital.
    <br>I told my husband I was going to call the church.
    <br>He said to go ahead.
    <br>I called and after one hour, I gave birth on top of my bed.
    <br>HEAR WHAT TB JOSHUA SAID ABOUT THIS BABY GIRL!!!
    <br>And I gave birth to a baby girl, the way the man of God said.
    <br>HEAR WHAT TB JOSHUA SAID ABOUT THIS BABY GIRL!!!
    <br>In the early stages of pregnancy, when  the baby was four months,
    <br>I was surprised that the man of God could know what was inside my womb.
    <br>So, that brought my husband to give his life to Jesus Christ.
    <br>HEAR WHAT TB JOSHUA SAID ABOUT THIS BABY GIRL!!!
    <br>Do you know the reason I was asking what was in her womb?
    <br>It was formless at that stage.
    <br>She was about to have a miscarriage.
    <br>I said, what are you carrying? I didn't see a baby there.
    <br>But prayer brought the whole thing together.
    <br>Because I had no reason to ask, "What are you carrying?"
    <br>Let's hear from the husband. Give thanks to God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Mr And Mrs Ibrahim, from Abuja.
    <br>When my wife came back to tell me - because I didn't come with her,
    <br>I was surprised and I told her that we should watch out.
    <br>The day she gave birth, she gave birth to a baby girl without complications.
    <br>I was so happy about that.
    <br>And since then, I have given my life to Christ.
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>Listen to what he said: He said that when the wife came back and told him
    <br>that the pastor said, baby girl
    <br>and they know that this is a miscarriage and they've been losing babies that way,
    <br>he said, "Let's watch out".
    <br>We're going to catch him. Watch out.
    <br>But when the baby is a baby girl---
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>I never see Your type oh
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>Blessed be Your holy name
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>I never see Your type oh
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>Blessed be Your holy name
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>I never see Your type oh
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>Blessed be Your holy name
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>I never see Your type oh
    <br>This kind God oh
    <br>Blessed be Your holy name
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>No one can convert except God.
    <br>Why are we fighting?
    <br>"That place is not good. Come to my place." It's wrong.
    <br>God can talk by Himself.
    <br>Please.
    <br>Where there is solution, there's conversion.
    <br>HEAR WHAT TB JOSHUA SAID ABOUT THIS BABY GIRL!!!
    <br>Where there is solution, there's forgiveness.
    <br>Where there is solution, there's reconciliation.
    <br>Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>In the process of restoring this relationship, there's nothing like abuse;
    <br>there's nothing like killing;
    <br>there's nothing like destruction;
    <br>there's nothing like disunity;
    <br>there's nothing like pain.
    <br>"You have to come to my church; every other place is not good."
    <br>It's wrong!
    <br>We should not fight for God;
    <br>let God fight for Himself.
    <br>HEAR WHAT TB JOSHUA SAID ABOUT THIS BABY GIRL!!!
    <br>It is not our own hard work or skill that enriches us.
    <br>God gives us power to get wealth.
    <br>There is no room for any man boasting of his power or ability.
    <br>This explains why people like me are in this position.
    <br>A man without fast legs, a man without the ability to inspire people,
    <br>a man without great strength to deploy is in this position.
    <br>Grace!
    <br>HEAR WHAT TB JOSHUA SAID ABOUT THIS BABY GIRL!!!
