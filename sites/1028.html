  <p>    
    <br>Immortal invisible God Faithful One
    <br>You are my King Invisible God
    <br>Great and Mighty One
    <br>There is none like You
    <br>For You are God all by Yourself
    <br>Forever You are the same
    <br>There is none like You
    <br>You are God all by Yourself
    <br>Forever You are the same
    <br>There is none like You
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may have your seats; thank you.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Faith requires us to speak them before we see or feel them.
    <br>You have to begin by believing, confessing and acting on God’s Word.
    <br>Then, you can bring Jesus on the scene, by believing.
    <br>This is what our faith requires – believing, confessing and acting on what?
    <br>On God’s Word.
    <br>You can bring Jesus on the scene, instantly.
    <br>It means you are not alone on your seat.
    <br>That you are sitting, looking – to many, you are not talking but your faith is talking.
    <br>I want to hear what your faith is saying because the words you speak determine the life you enjoy.
    <br>The words that are going on in your heart determine the life you enjoy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(The words that are going on in your heart determine the life you enjoy.)
    <br>No, I don't know what you are saying.
    <br>You are sitting quietly but your faith is talking.
    <br>I'm saying: what is going on in your heart determines the life you enjoy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(What is going on in your heart determines the life you enjoy.)
    <br>That is, the words you speak determine the life you enjoy.
    <br>They say, "I'm sitting down, I'm not talking."
    <br>Who told you you were not talking?
    <br>Something is going on.
    <br>"Look at this man. What is he saying? Hmm."
    <br>A lot is going on in your heart - it determines the life you enjoy next.
    <br>The words a man speaks create the blessing or curses in his way.
    <br>The reason is that your mouth is a revealer of the belief in your heart.
    <br>What is going on in your heart?
    <br>Something is going on – you are saying something; you know you have no control.
    <br>If I am not talking, my faith is talking.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(If I am not talking, my faith is talking.)
    <br>If I am not moving, my faith is moving.
    <br>(If I am not moving, my faith is moving.)
    <br>If I am not looking, my faith is looking.
    <br>(If I am not looking, my faith is looking.)
    <br>Just close your eyes and say, "I'm not looking, I can't see anything." - your faith is looking.
    <br>You say you are sleeping.
    <br>You faith is alive.
    <br>That is why if anyone comes to you in the dream...
    <br>Later I say, "Oh. It was a dream. I'm not talking, I'm not going to talk." - your faith is talking.
    <br>"I'm not praying. I'm not going to pray. I don't believe. I'm not going to pray."
    <br>Who told you are not praying?
    <br>How will you live next?
    <br>"I'm not going to pray" - they say your brother doesn't pray.
    <br>Who told you your brother doesn't pray?
    <br>His heart is saying something.
    <br>If you want to know what a man’s heart is saying, the next life will tell you.
    <br>Not now, next will tell you.
    <br>When a man suddenly falls on the floor...
    <br>Before that falling there was a thought that was going in his heart, "I hope I will not fall. I will fall. I will not fall.
    <br>I feel dizzy."
    <br>Before you know it you find yourself on the floor.
    <br>Sometimes, for you to know that it is not possible for you not to talk -
    <br>if you are not talking your faith is talking.
    <br>Sometimes, you would be just sitting down; something will be telling you,
    <br>"That my brother Kenneth is coming; he will be coming now. He will come today."
    <br>Before you know it you see brother Kenneth.
    <br>Only you will say, "This is what is going on in my heart."
    <br>Also if it is evil, you sit and say, "Ah, this vehicle seems - it will have an accident."
    <br>Only you, nobody knows you are talking about that.
    <br>Before you know it - an accident, "This is what was going on in my heart."
    <br>Say, “If I am not talking, my faith is talking.”
    <br>If I am not praying, my faith is praying.
    <br>What kind of faith?
    <br>Is it faith in faith or faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ?
    <br>That will determine the life you enjoy.
    <br>If I am not talking, my faith is talking.
    <br>That is why sometimes - I stop praying because I want you to hear what I'm going to say.
    <br>I say, "In Jesus' name" because I want you to hear me.
    <br>After that "In Jesus' name", everyone will see me stretching my hand, and they get healed.
    <br>In the past they said, "This man does not mention the name 'Jesus'. He doesn't call the name 'Jesus' -
    <br>we don't know whom he is calling."
    <br>OK, Pharisees and Sadducees, “In Jesus’ name…”.
    <br>By the time I do that for ten people, I will get tired.
    <br>I have employed flesh in calling the name Jesus.
    <br>We employ much flesh to the things of the Spirit.
    <br>Once you light a candle, it is lightened - just place it.
    <br>So, you cannot light the candle, and light it again... no.
    <br>Since it is not quenched, it is not off.
    <br>You just light a candle - that is the name of Jesus.
    <br>But if it is not lightened, you continue to light it...
    <br>Once you want to pray for four people here; in the face of sister you say, "In the name of Jesus",
    <br>and you know Jesus hears you - He will continue to follow you to do the rest.
    <br>It is when you know Jesus...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is when you know Jesus, and He does hear what you are saying; you say, "In Jesus name - be healed"...
    <br>Because you don't believe Jesus has heard you.
    <br>Our mouth is a revealer of the belief in our heart.
    <br>There is power in our mouth but belief in our heart is released by faith.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith and faith requires us to speak before we feel or see it.
    <br>The words we speak determine the life we enjoy.
    <br>What life are you enjoying?
    <br>This is the reason when we say, “In Jesus’ name”,
    <br>and another man says, “In Jesus’ name”, we see different results -
    <br>some idle, some meaningless, some oftentimes destructive.
    <br>Some will say, "In Jesus' name" - the result is meaningless.
    <br>Other will say, "In Jesus' name" - the outcome is idle.
    <br>Another people will say, "In Jesus' name" - oftentimes it is destructive.
    <br>What is the cause of this?
    <br>If the words you speak in prayer, preaching or teaching are not according to the Word of God,
    <br>are not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>they oftentimes remain idle, meaningless and destructive.
    <br>If they are not according to the Word of God,
    <br>if the are not according to the Spirit of God, they remain idle, meaningless, oftentimes destructive.
    <br>You just say... when you want to sleep you say, "In Jesus' name I pray, Lord...".
    <br>You now open the Bible and pray.
    <br>In that night the demon will come and wake you up and start beating you.
    <br>He will even carry the Bible you placed on the bed and he will hit you with it, "What are you saying?"
    <br>By the time you wake up you say, "Ah. I pray, I call the name 'Jesus' and I open the Bible;
    <br>and this is a serious nightmare. Why demon is still fighting me?"
    <br>Because your prayers are not according to the Word of God, not according to the Spirit of God.
    <br>And the Bible says that the Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.)
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in honour of His Word.
    <br>Again.
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in honour of His Word.
    <br>So, if you now stand to say, "Jesus... Help me, Jesus. In Jesus' name"...
    <br>There is the language of today and the language of the Bible.
    <br>If what you are saying is not the language of the Bible,
    <br>I mean, not according to God’s Word, not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>it will remain idle, meaningless or oftentimes destructive.
    <br>You will invite demons; that will invite demons to come and attack you.
    <br>Because if anywhere demons hear the name Jesus they want to...
    <br>They will just look, "Who is calling Jesus?"
    <br>And if they know there is no authority; and you are not calling the name 'Jesus' according to His Spirit,
    <br>not according to God's Word - they will jump on you.
    <br>This is what happened to seven sons of Sheva.
    <br>They said, "Jesus we know, God of Paul we know. Who are you?"
    <br>Because they realized that the name 'Jesus' they were calling was not according to His Spirit,
    <br>was not according to His Word.
    <br>They attacked them.
    <br>Many of us have been attacked, if the name is not according to His Word, or according to His Spirit -
    <br>you will be attacked.
    <br>"I call the name 'Jesus'. I believe in Jesus" - but not according to His Spirit, not according to His Word.
    <br>There is what we call, "language of today" and "language of the Bible".
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in honour of His Word; that is God's Word.
    <br>So, you can see now the reason why you have to be genuine; you have to be properly born-again.
    <br>There are many claiming to be Christians, all over the world.
    <br>You see them and keep asking yourself, "What is wrong?"
    <br>No, if your Christianity is not according to His Word, according to His Spirit;
    <br>my brother, your life will remain meaningless, idle, and many times attacked.
    <br>That name 'Jesus'; when you call it...
    <br>Whoever calls that name; whether you have the right to call that name, according to Spirit,
    <br>or according to His Word,
    <br>or you don't have any right to call it - you are just calling the name because other call that name -
    <br>satan always, "Ha! 'Jesus' - who is the person?"
    <br>He wants to know by what authority, meaning - are you calling the name according to His Word?
    <br>Who gave the right to call that name?
    <br>Are you calling the name according to His Spirit?
    <br>We can now see where our problem is coming from.
    <br>Our problem is coming from, "We are not Christians according to His Word.
    <br>We are not Christians according to His Spirit."
    <br>You can only be a Christian according to His Spirit.
    <br>You must be led - that is what I mean.
    <br>No one can say, “Jesus is Lord”, except by what?
    <br>By the Spirit!
    <br>It means you must be led to be a Christian.
    <br>No one can say, “Jesus is Lord”, except he is led, helped, guided by the Spirit.
    <br>This is why there is a fashion all over; we have religious people and we have Christians - there is a difference.
    <br>Christians / religious people.
    <br>There is a difference - the difference is just that: as a Christian you must be led by the Spirit.
    <br>You can start now; and how do we start this?
    <br>Yes; begin to meditate over the verses.
    <br>Not thinking about the verses; thinking is different from meditation.
    <br>You can only think about your challenges, problems, debts,
    <br>but when you talk of meditation you talk of your heart.
    <br>You mean devotion.
    <br>If not, many of us will get there, before we know we are not Christians.
    <br>And I don't want you to get there, before you know you are not a Christian.
    <br>With what we are seeing in the world today, it is so difficult to actually know who is Christian.
    <br>It is so difficult.
    <br>Because ceremonies, everything...
    <br>The church have been taken over by ceremonies.
    <br>You will be shocked.
    <br>It is so difficult; only Spirit of God can tell you, "This is Christian and this is religious man." - you don't know.
    <br>It is so difficult.
    <br>I don't want you to get there, before you know you are not a Christian.
    <br>Everywhere ceremonies, according to the syllabus, table or program - that is not Christianity.
    <br>The Church of the Holy Spirit should be next, not now.
    <br>Whatever we are doing in the Church of the Holy Spirit should be next, not now.
    <br>But today, now is the church; we know we want to do, read, sing - everything is in the syllabus
    <br>how things should be - conventions.
    <br>The Spirit inspires us from time to time, from moment to moment; telling us next.
    <br>Sometimes, we get loosed, disconnected; we don't know what to do next.
    <br>That will attest to our fitting; if you fit or you don't fit - you can know.
    <br>But how do you know if you fit, when what you want to do is already on the paper?
    <br>It is programmed, you just need to read it.
    <br>You can know if you fit.
    <br>I take you back again.
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to the degree you stand in reverence,
    <br>I mean, in honour of His Word.
    <br>How do you honour His Word?
    <br>How do we honour His Word?
    <br>The Word of God must be integral – that is, part of you.
    <br>It stays here and later goes there.
    <br>It must be in your heart by meditation.
    <br>By meditation, your heart can act upon the Word.
    <br>Heart means your spirit.
    <br>That is, your spirit acts upon the Word by meditation.
    <br>When your spirit acts upon the Word, it begins to influence your character and behaviours.
    <br>"I don't want to smoke" - you can only stop that smoking when the Word acts upon your spirit; it will stop you.
    <br>But if the Word has not yet acted upon your spirit, and you say you want to stop smoking;
    <br>you will stop for a while.
    <br>After some time, you start in a big way.
    <br>By meditation, our heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>That is, your spirit acts upon the Word; that is joined, immersed.
    <br>When that happens, it begins to influence your conduct, your character.
    <br>What you say, "I cannot stop smoking" - you just find that smoking stopped,
    <br>because that Word has acted upon your spirit.
    <br>Sometimes you say, "I don't know; I've been trying to stop. I'm a child of God. I've been coming to church.
    <br>They have prayed for me."
    <br>The prayer will not do that.
    <br>"They have prayed for me" - to build your character.
    <br>Prayer cannot do anything if the prayer is not offered according to His Spirit, His Word.
    <br>So please, let us be genuine, OK?
    <br>Because sometimes you just begin, continue to fake yourself.
    <br>And you don't even know.
    <br>You will not even know; that is why I don't want us to get there before we know.
    <br>It will be too late, to get there before we know.
    <br>Ignorance is not an excuse.
    <br>We have so much wisdom, knowledge about the Bible but that knowledge
    <br>does not seem to be according to His Spirit, not according to His Word.
    <br>You will preach it, teach it; very good teacher, when you are give a mic to preach here... he is a good preacher.
    <br>You may be a good preacher but not according to His Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You may be a good preacher but not according to His Spirit."
    <br>That is, the presence of God is the Spirit.
    <br>The presence of God in what we are saying is that Spirit.
    <br>You can talk without the presence of God, "Jesus!"; people will say, "Oh my God - it is a good preacher" -
    <br>not according to His Spirit.
    <br>So, now, I want to leave you here.
    <br>The way out: meditation.
    <br>When we say 'meditation';
    <br>take more of me, oh Lord Jesus; give me more of You, of Lord Jesus.
    <br>When you are saying this; even your body will not move.
    <br>Nobody will know what you are saying.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You – more of Your obedience, more of Your kindness,
    <br>more of Your purity, more of Your faithfulness, more of Your holiness.
    <br>Take more of me, Lord and give me more of You.
    <br>This is what you should engage your heart in.
    <br>If you don’t engage your heart, your heart will engage itself.
    <br>Engaging your heart; begin to pray at the same time as you hear me, "What this man is saying?
    <br>Give me the grace to do it, to practice it.
    <br>Take more of me, Lord. Give me a hearing heart."
    <br>This is what you should engage on.
    <br>If you don’t engage your heart, your heart will engage itself.
    <br>You have to engage your heart in sowing to the Spirit.
    <br>Give me a hearing heart, Lord.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>When you are saying this, automatically your heart will act upon the Word I am speaking to you.
    <br>The heart doesn’t just act upon the Word without the grace.
    <br>While you are saying that, your heart will act upon the Word and when the heart acts upon the Word,
    <br>you will suddenly find your character and behaviour changing.
    <br>What you felt you couldn't stop; you will start stopping them.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You - give me a hearing heart.
    <br>So, you create a habit; for you to be great in the Lord you must have a habit.
    <br>It means; the time for yourself, the time to meditate on the Word of God.
    <br>You talk of prayer...
    <br>Prayer cannot work without your spirit joining itself to God’s Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “There’s no prayer without your heart acting upon the Word.”
    <br>This is what we are taught today, "Prayer is the key. Prayer is the master-key."
    <br>It is master-key, when your heart acts upon the Word it becomes prayer.
    <br>Look at what I said.
    <br>I said to you that the Word you speak determines the life you enjoy, if the heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>Take note of that; my heart must act upon the Word.
    <br>This is what I mean by;
    <br>the Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
