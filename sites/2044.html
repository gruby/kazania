    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>My name is Ã‰lida and I come from Paraguay.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>What has God done in your life? What was your experience?
    <br>I experienced excruciating pain in my body, which was increasing every day.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I spent most of my time bedridden.
    <br>The problem started 10 years ago but for the last three years, I was bedridden.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Every day, the problem worsened and I could not sleep because of the pain.
    <br>I went to the neurologist and did some tests.
    <br>The results showed that I had a herniated disc and two cysts.
    <br>The back pain was excruciating.
    <br>It affected every part of my body and I could not move.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I could neither sweep nor clean the house.
    <br>I was praying and asking for God's guidance.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I asked God if I should go for surgery or if He would heal me.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>The doctor told me that I must be operated upon but I refused because I was afraid.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>My family suffered a lot due to this sickness, especially as my husband could not go to work.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>He stayed at home to take care of me and feed me since I was bedridden.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Later, we heard that Prophet T.B. Joshua was coming to Paraguay.
    <br>What did you feel when Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for you during the crusade?
    <br>When the prophet approached me,
    <br>I felt something supernatural in my life.
    <br>I felt the touch of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>God Himself sent His anointing through the prophet to me.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I felt something supernatural; I got up without any pain and now I can walk!
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I could not sit down, bend down or raise my hands but now I can run, to the glory of God!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>I am free and I feel so light, as if I'm walking on the air. Glory be to God!
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>My advice is: Go to the feet of Christ.
    <br>It is written that all these signs will follow those who believe in His name.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>The prophet is a servant used by God.
    <br>As God used the prophet to heal me, He can also use Him to heal you.
