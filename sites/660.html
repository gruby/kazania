  <p>    
    <br>Attention! There are numerous fake websites, email addresses and social media accounts
    <br>requesting or encouraging for donations in the name of The SCOAN, T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>They may claim to be collecting funds to build a SCOAN worship centre,
    <br>bible college or orphanage in their respective countries.
    <br>Others also solicit funds for spiritual items to be sent out.
    <br>They are fraudsters!
    <br>There is currently no plan to build or acquire SCOAN premises worldwide.
    <br>Don't let anyone deceive you.
    <br>For donations: God has a way  of speaking to the hearts of His people for our needs.
    <br>We never send anyone and can never send anyone.
    <br>If we need you (partners), we have a way of reaching you, through Emmanuel TV - which is our mouthpiece.
    <br>Following are just a few examples out of thousands of fraulent announcements.
    <br>FAKE
