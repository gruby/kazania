    <br>She can go on her own.
    <br>So that is it; salvation is personal, nobody will follow you there; you just go there and drop yourself.
    <br>You can just drop her at the edge of the mountain and push her inside.
    <br>I am Linda from South Africa. 
    <br>The problem is almost everything that's around here but for now, it is stiff neck and fibroids.
    <br>You listen to what she said, that the problem is almost everything!
    <br>Don't worry, this is what you are going to say there. 
    <br>Okay? Thank you.
    <br>I want just to show you how you can get there.
    <br>Suffering From A Stiff Neck - Using A Neck Collar And An Arm Sling - Going To The SCOAN Altar
    <br>This is why I am here to show you the principle.
    <br>They are there; they are problem solvers.
    <br>Let her lead. 
    <br>You go first; we will follow you.
    <br>We will be the ones to follow you.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>The woman with the problem of stiff neck due to dislocation of the clavicle
    <br>and she has been using a neck collar for the past 15 years.
    <br>At this point now, it is you and the heavenly beings; we leave you here.
    <br>So here we will help you sit down.
    <br>This is what we can do; over to you, roll to the middle, just go.
    <br>It's alright; remove it!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>See her removing her neck collar.
    <br>What is this in your hand? 
    <br>Satan, you are a liar.
    <br>Stand up there!
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>Thank you! Rub my head.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You can see the woman rising to her feet.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Healed Of Stiff Neck - No Longer Using A Neck Collar And An Arm Sling
    <br>I am free in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>I need to do my own!
    <br>My own is not a neck collar; my own is you people!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Praying On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Watch your screen; the man of God is also taking his turn.
    <br>I want you to hear what I want to say.
    <br>God help me warn these people.
    <br>They are disturbing me too much in Jesus' name. 
    <br>Thank You.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>I want to give a testimony; video me coming down!
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>You know what happened? It's like I entered the furnace.
    <br>Maybe you may not see it but when you come to me, you will know.
    <br>People with critical health conditions.
    <br>My name is Monica Green, I am from Sierra Leone.
    <br>The problem that brought me here is that I have a fracture in my left ankle
    <br>and I am using two crutches and a moon boot.
    <br>I want God to heal me today.
    <br>Suffering From Left Ankle Fracture - Using Crutches And A Moon Boot - Going To The SCOAN Altar
    <br>That's a woman with the problem of left ankle fracture, using a pair of crutches and a moon boot.
    <br>She's come all the way from Sierra Leone with this problem and you can see how difficult it is
    <br>even for her to walk with a pair of crutches right now.
    <br>And she's making her way to the mountain of prayer
    <br>to seek for a divine solution to this problem that has taken her
    <br>to many places in search of a solution, but to no avail.
    <br>On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>At this point, she is climbing the mountain; help her.
    <br>On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Roll in! 
    <br>Over to you.
    <br>Watch your screen and see the woman praying.
    <br>You can remove it!
    <br>Suffering From Left Ankle Fracture - Using Crutches And A Moon Boot - Praying On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Oh yes, you can see the place where she was operated on.
    <br>You can see the ankle has been operated on.
    <br>Madam, what else again? Do you want to see Jesus physically?
    <br>Help her!
    <br>You can see the woman on her feet, taking her steps for the first time without crutches
    <br>after praying at the mountain of prayer.
    <br>Thank You Jesus, I am healed!
    <br>I can walk without crutches, I can walk without the moon boot.
    <br>The doctor told me I would use the moon boot and walking aids for the rest of my life.
    <br>I just want to thank God for healing me.
    <br>Healed Of Left Ankle Fracture - No Longer Using A Pair Of Crutches And A Moon Boot
    <br>What experience did you have there when you were rubbing?
    <br>Did you experience any atmosphere which is different from where you are now?
    <br>As soon as I went on top of the altar, I just lost consciousness for a moment.
    <br>She said she lost consciousness, as if she fainted or was in a coma.
    <br>That shows that her 'self' was gone, meaning she was not there by herself.
    <br>Unforgiving spirit or bad feeling...
    <br>Right now I am expecting you, if you have the opportunity, to make a phone call
    <br>to your greatest enemy - someone you say, "Over my dead body!"
    <br>It is either you make that call now, or after you come back from the mountain, the altar,
    <br>you quickly make that call and say, "Please, I love you"
    <br>or you can send a text message: "Oh I love you!"
    <br>So when you send such a message and your enemy sees that kind of message,
    <br>they may think it is a mistake, then when you go back, you can send more of these messages.
    <br>So, please let it go; you have nothing to do with an enemy.
    <br>You can see the woman walking to the glory of God.
    <br>Doing for the first time what she could not do for a long time,
    <br>walking freely without the use of a pair of crutches.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>That is the way the woman has been moving about with a walker,
    <br>without which she has not been able to stand, let alone walk, for the past 11 years.
    <br>She has been having this problem and came all the way from Tanzania in East Africa. 
    <br>Let's watch right now and see how God Almighty sets her free from this problem of 11 years.
    <br>Watch your screen - from this point, she has to be carried.

    <br>Suffering From Advanced Bilateral Knee & Hip Osteoarthritis - Praying On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Receiving Healing In Jesus' Name On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Glory be to God! See how she is rising to her feet by herself!
    <br>I am free in Jesus' name! I can walk!
    <br>Watch your screen, you can see the woman making her way down from the mountain of prayer.
    <br>Having been set free, now we can see her walking by herself
    <br>without the use of the walker, which she had been using for the past 11 years.
    <br>The Living Water Serice
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Mama is walking! Hallelujah! 
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
