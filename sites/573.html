  <p>    
    <br>My name is John Onebunne.
    <br>I am from Anambra State, Nigeria, but I live in Cameroon.
    <br>This is my elder brother, Sylvester Onebunne.
    <br>This is his wife, Helen Onebunne.
    <br>This is their son, Chibuzor Onebunne,
    <br>and another son of theirs.
    <br>This is my younger brother, Martin Onebunne
    <br>and our brother-in-law.
    <br>I am a Nigerian living in Cameroon.
    <br>I am so happy to come here because I watch Emmanuel TV
    <br>and I believe the solution to our problem is here.
    <br>The man of God will use the necessary armour that God that has given him
    <br>to bring us to reconciliation,
    <br>reconstruct us
    <br>and deliver us, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I accused my brother, Sylvester Onebunne, of being a ritualist.
    <br>He is the one who took me to Cameroon and gave me money to establish my business.
    <br>Along the line - from 1994 - things didn't go the way they were supposed to.
    <br>My business was going down.
    <br>Whenever he gave me money, the money would go down.
    <br>Also, his children who are here are abnormal.
    <br>I said that he used them for a ritual purpose.
    <br>These are the children. They are abnormal and don't reason very well.
    <br>And it bothers me so much.
    <br>You are accusing him that he used the children ...
    <br>...to do a ritual ...
    <br>... to do a ritual ...
    <br>... to find money ...
    <br>... to get money, because he himself has money.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Did you see him in a vision? Are you a pastor?
    <br>Thank you very much. In 1999, his first son died and he had the same ailment.
    <br>I went to many herbalists in an attempt to discover the cause, but I could not find a solution.
    <br>In 1998, I joined a prayer group in the church and we started reading Scripture.
    <br>From there, I decided to pray.
    <br>You saw it in a vision that your brother is a ritualist?
    <br>I saw him in a vision many times mocking me.
    <br>What made me confirm it is that he went and sued me to a shrine.
    <br>My name is Sylvester Onebunne.
    <br>I am the eldest brother. This is not my direct follower.
    <br>He is second to my direct follower.
    <br>I took care of my brother right from his infancy.
    <br>I trained him and started a business for him here in Nigeria.
    <br>He lavished the money and accused the landlord of using witchcraft to take the money from him.
    <br>Your brother said that he brought you up from a small age.
    <br>No, he did not bring me up from my young age.
    <br>At what age?
    <br>I was twenty years old when he took me to Cameroon.
    <br>But he is the one that established you.
    <br>Yes, he established me in my business.
    <br>When I took him to Cameroon in 1980, I bought ten cartons of tobacco
    <br>and paid transport for him to bring the tobacco to Nigeria to sell because that was his line of business.
    <br>Then he took the ten cartons of tobacco to Nigeria.
    <br>Up to this moment, he has not told me whether he sold the tobacco or not.
    <br>I did not mind because I have more regard for this brother than a man would have for his own son.
    <br>Now, I'm coming.
    <br>He called you a ritualist. He said that you used your children to do money rituals; that is why you are rich.
    <br>I have just heard here in The SCOAN that I used my children to do rituals.
    <br>He has never before told me this, rather he disclosed it to other people.
    <br>As regards the children, he has never asked me about them.
    <br>He has also never organised his prayer group to pray for these children.
    <br>I don't know where all these things are coming from.
    <br>I don't want to waste much time because where we are is not a court of man, but a court of God.
    <br>That is why I am happy, because God stands for justice.
    <br>These are your children?
    <br>Yes, these are my children.
    <br>It is a dream I had that confirmed it to me.
    <br>That confirmed that he is a ritualist?
    <br>Nobody, no witchcraft, no wizard, no group - it is a dream I had.
    <br>I entered into the church because of the downfall of my business and right now I am doing nothing.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN to resolve this matter.
    <br>Apart from saying your brother is this or that, the greatest sin you have committed now is calling him a ritualist.
    <br>And because of that singular sin, that is why you are in trouble. He is an innocent person.
    <br>He is somebody who introduced you (to business).
    <br>When you started counting money like this, he was the first person to (help you).
    <br>What is happening is a generational curse.
    <br>It is not a ritual; it is a sickness.
    <br>Exactly, man of God. It is true.
    <br>TWO Sons Sacrificed In MONEY RITUAL
    <br>Man of God, my brother has wrongly accused me. He has made me run mad.
    <br>Enough.
    <br>No. Leave me alone. I haven't done anything to him.
    <br>Enough.
    <br>I haven't done anything to him. He's accused me of being a ritualist because of my children.
    <br>It is enough. It is okay.
    <br>TWO Sons Sacrificed In MONEY RITUAL
    <br>He have just heard a reconciliation meeting between this family.
    <br>The man in question was accused of being a ritualist - that he used his two boys for rituals.
    <br>But right now, the man of God has declared the man innocent; that it is just a generational curse.
    <br>That even the same problem happened to the first son that died many years ago.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for this great revelation
    <br>that has proved the man innocent of what he has been accused of.
    <br>Right now, the reconciliation is still going on and we thank God Almighty for what He has done in the life of this family.
    <br>I think that whatever happened, one of the things you have achieved today is for me to have you as a friend.
    <br>I think that is it.
    <br>That one is greater than whatever happened.
    <br>And I want you to ...
    <br>You need to forgive because you need to be forgiven.
    <br>Go and take care of your home.
    <br>I want to see all of you.
    <br>All my brothers were like this one.
    <br>When I told them what he said, they asked me if he was crazy,
    <br>because if he is normal, he can't say such a thing to me.
    <br>TWO Sons Sacrificed In MONEY RITUAL
    <br>I am most happy that this thing has been judged in God's court so,
    <br>I forgive you.
    <br>TWO Sons Sacrificed In MONEY RITUAL
    <br>Glory be to God. You can see what has just happened now.
    <br>The brother has forgiven his younger brother and the reconciliation is taking place with the whole family.
    <br>Now the two brothers need to be delivered.
    <br>The world and everyone has seen. The family are watching Emmanuel TV all over the world.
    <br>This is an innocent man.
    <br>This is just the work of satan and devil to scatter and destroy the family. So there is nothing like that.
    <br>These two brothers behave like imbeciles.
    <br>It is in the family. It is generational curses.
    <br>It is not a ritual or whatever.
    <br>Go and wait for me, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Rise up and give thanks to God.
