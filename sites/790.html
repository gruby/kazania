  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We were shocked this morning when we saw many people around the church -
    <br>they came to me and said that there are people around the church with sickness and disease.
    <br>I said, "Wow, this is not a healing service".
    <br>It is a normal service.
    <br>But what we are seeing today -
    <br>I think we will not allow these people to go.
    <br>But next time...
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Next time I think God would permit us to allow them to go.
    <br>Yes, that is the way God does.
    <br>He said before one is before all.
    <br>Don't do that again.
    <br>Yes, if you now do them...
    <br>Okay.
    <br>While praying for them, the grace is enough for you to receive: Put your demand on the anointing
    <br>While praying for them you do what? Put your demand on the anointing.
    <br>When I say, "In the name of Jesus", you say, "Oh, Lord Jesus, oh Lord".
    <br>While I pray for them, begin to pray for yourself
    <br>and when the person gets healed, you are healed.
    <br>When the person gets delivered, you are delivered.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me usher you to that because we are about to enter another section.
    <br>It will be be difficult for me to begin to heal, pray for people and carry you along without ushering you there.
    <br>Ushering means teaching you, preparing you.
    <br>You need a proper connection to understand what we are about to do.
    <br>You just finished dancing. That realm of dancing - it takes anointing to dance.
    <br>I need to take you out of that, and take you to another realm.
    <br>So, I need to get you prepared.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>We are going to another realm -
    <br>another realm where you will see things happen, but you won't know how they happened.
    <br>Another realm where physical hands will not be needed to do things.
    <br>You will see this happen - our strength, our tension are not necessary, are not needed -
    <br>another realm where our voice and our tongue are not needed.
    <br>When you want to move this, you need to use your hand.
    <br>But in this case, you don't need the hand to take it, and it will move.
    <br>That is why it is difficult for us to understand why something happens.
    <br>God does not give us what we know how to do.
    <br>He always gives us what we don't know how to do, so that he can teach us.
    <br>God does not give us what we know how to do.
    <br>Look at this.
    <br>If God says, "Carry it", you know how to carry it. This is it.
    <br>No, what God normally does is to ask you to carry this pillar. Look at the pillar.
    <br>Can you carry it ? He always gives us what we don't know how to do,
    <br>what we cannot even do by ourselves.
    <br>Because he wants to teach us - in the process of teaching us, He gets us trained in His own way.
    <br>He gets us reformed in His own way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>He does not just heal what a medical doctor can just treat you for.
    <br>If you are sick, you meet a doctor and he would treat you.
    <br>This is why I was saying:
    <br>If you cannot believe God with your tablets and your drugs,
    <br>you cannot believe Him without your tablets.
    <br>You carry a drug for hypertension, a drug for heart attack, a drug for diabetics.
    <br>You have it in your pocket because you must take it every two hours.
    <br>You are sitting down and begin to pray, "Lord, I don't want to use these drugs anymore. Heal me, heal me".
    <br>At the end of the day, you are prayed for.
    <br>After praying for you, you now begin to look for an evangelist,
    <br>"Please, I want to know whether I should still use my drugs.
    <br>I want to know whether I can still use my tablets.
    <br>I would need to see the man of God".
    <br>"Prophet, these are my tablets. I don't know what to do with it."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you cannot believe God with your tablets and your drugs,
    <br>you cannot believe Him without your tablets and your drugs.
    <br>God has nothing against your tablets.
    <br>He has nothing against it - it is made from a natural plant.
    <br>The soap you are using, either a medicated or a different kind of soap -
    <br>those things are just like tablets. If using tablets is wrong, the soap you are using is also wrong.
    <br>The cream you are using to rub your body is wrong.
    <br>These are from plants, medicated things from the doctors and pharmacies.
    <br>If that drug is bad, your cream, your soap you are using every day are then also bad.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I was giving you some clues on how you would know that you are free
    <br>or that God does not want you to use your tablets again.
    <br>If you have been prayed for, there are some signs that actually remind you of your tablets:
    <br>either you would have a serious headache, feel dizzy or discomfort.
    <br>Your body would be trembling.
    <br>These are some of the signs that would normally remind you of your tablets.
    <br>But when you have been prayed for and suddenly, you don't have those signs again,
    <br>automatically, you will forget your drugs.
    <br>You just find that you live, sleep and eat.
    <br>On the second or third day, you ask yourself, "I have not been taking that drug, I've forgotten".
    <br>You have forgotten because those signs are gone. That is God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is God.
    <br>You have to forget because those signs are gone.
    <br>When those signs are gone - the signs of headache, unability to sleep, unability to eat, all kinds of signs -
    <br>you cannot sense them again, and those are the signs that remind you of your drug and tablets.
    <br>First, second day, you will just realise, "My dear, for the past two days, I have not been taking my drugs.
    <br>because those signs are gone".
    <br>That is God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But when you keep on remembering your drugs after you have been prayed for,
    <br>something is wrong.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Many of you have been sitting here since this morning.
    <br>At home, they can't try to sit for five hours without taking a tablet.
    <br>But right now, they have forgotten about their tablet because they can't feel any sign.
    <br>That is God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us quickly move ahead to our healing and deliverance section today.
    <br>Let's take a very short text in the Bible.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The book of John 1, verse 33:
    <br>"And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptise with water told me."
    <br>If you take it from verse 1, you would understand it better.
    <br>But I am taking it from verse 33.
    <br>I take it again:
    <br>"And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptise with water told me,
    <br>the man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain..."
    <br>But today, it is like the Spirit comes down on us but does not remain.
    <br>The miracle happens to us but seems not to be permanent.
    <br>We keep receiving blessing but we cannot keep the blessing.
    <br>We keep receiving deliverance but after a while, you are possessed again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>He wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: LET THE HOLY SPIRIT REMAIN
    <br>But because we keep on grieving Him, we are not allowing Him.
    <br>He does not remain permanent when we grieve Him.
    <br>He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>He does not remain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We grieve Him by our pride and we express our pride in various ways.
    <br>Like this: "OK, those of you that received healing, come out".
    <br>When you are waiting for healing, you are crying, shouting, this and that.
    <br>Immediately you are healed, you don't want to come out.
    <br>You don't want to face the camera.
    <br>But when you were sick, you wanted to face the camera.
    <br>We express our pride in various ways.
    <br>Can you see some of the reasons why we cannot maintain...
    <br>It says that the Holy Spirit came down on Him and remained.
    <br>We receive but not remain.
    <br>After a while when we get out there...
    <br>There are many things we do.
    <br>You hold a grudge against your brother - you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>After the healing, you still hold a grudge against your brother
    <br>and the Bible says,"'Forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You should not be surprised if the Bible is not real while reading, if you hold a grudge.
    <br>You will be reading the Bible, but it is not alive
    <br>because you are holding a grudge, offence against your brother.
    <br>That is one of the reasons why when you read the Bible, you are just wasting your time.
    <br>There is no life in what you are reading about.
    <br>There is book, there is life, coming together.
    <br>Scripture is literature but when it is inspired by the Holy Spirit, it becomes the Bible.
    <br>It is when it is inspired by the Holy Spirit, it has authority.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you hold grudges against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You should not be surprised if the Bible is not real when reading.
    <br>This is why we men of God - sometimes, I just laugh.
    <br>Holding offence against ourselves and we stand on the pulpit and begin to preach.
    <br>The Bible cannot be real when holding an offence or you just finished accusing your fellow ministers of God,
    <br>"That place is not good" and on next Sunday, you hold the Bible and begin to preach.
    <br>What do you need to do now before we go into the realm of healing, deliverance and salvation?
    <br>You need to let go of your past.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, if you let go in your heart, it is OK.
    <br>Even without giving a phone call to whoever you are holding an offence against,
    <br>once you let go in your heart, it is finished.
    <br>You have settled with God.
    <br>Even if you don't give a phone call to the person you are holding an offence against,
    <br>but you decide in your heart to let go, you have settled with God.
    <br>When you sometimes say, "This woman - they should kill her", you don't know that maybe this woman has settled with God.
    <br>If you have killed the woman, and this woman had settled with God, you are committing an offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let go of offence
    <br>because Jesus wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Jesus wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>The Holy Spirit wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>If He wants to be Himself in us, we need to allow Him to be Himself in us.
    <br>We need to do what?
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>You need to allow Him to be Himself in you.
    <br>By holding offence against your neighbour, the Holy Spirit cannot remain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All you need to know now is: How can the blessing remain?
    <br>That is what we call maintenance.
    <br>If you are healed, will you be able to maintain the healing?
    <br>If you are delivered, how will you maintain the deliverance?
    <br>If you are blessed, how will you maintain the blessing?
    <br>Your life is like this because you have not maintained them.
    <br>If you had been maintaining God's blessings in your life, your life would not look like this.
    <br>Many things God had given you, you failed to maintain them.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: LET THE HOLY SPIRIT REMAIN
    <br>Holding grudges against your brother - you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When you grieve the Holy Spirit, you will read the Bible but will not understand it.
    <br>It will not be alive - as if you are reading literature, as if you are reading a novel.
    <br>This is why you don't understand the Bible.
    <br>You take some psalms to read, you rehearse the psalms.
    <br>And you realise that... no!
    <br>Even the name Jesus you call, you are supposed to call it by authority -
    <br>but each time you call the name Jesus, you are calling yourself.
    <br>You say, "In Jesus' name" and you realise you are calling yourself because nobody answers you.
    <br>Only the people that are around you hear you, and you yourself hear yourself.
    <br>That is just it because you have grieved the Holy Spirit by holding offence, holding grudges.
    <br>Begin to release yourself right now.
    <br>You can make a decision now that enough is enough.
    <br>I have said it all. Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right...
    <br>Leave it for God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Begin right now; let me see your heart, your spirit in communion with God.
    <br>Begin to communicate; begin to pray right now.
    <br>Begin to pray and say, "Lord I surrender".
    <br>That is the first step in surrendering to God; say "I surrender".
    <br>If you have surrendered, have you let go of offence, pain of the past, bitterness?
    <br>At least something happened before you can have bitterness in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Resentment.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hatred.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, I want to see your spirit begin to commune with God, pray in your spirit.
    <br>Pray in your spirit.
    <br>Begin to settle your account right now, viewers at home, begin to settle your account.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Lord. In Jesus' name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up. I surrender.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All to Jesus I surrender, all to Him I freely give
    <br>I will ever love and trust Him in His presence daily
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Thee my blessed Saviour I surrender all
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Thee my blessed Saviour I surrender all
    <br>That is the first step in relationship with God.
    <br>It has been very difficult for many of us; you keep claiming your rights.
    <br>I have been cheated.
    <br>This is an embarrassment.
    <br>He is the one to be saying sorry.
    <br>He cheated me.
    <br>No. Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence
    <br>or grudge against your brother.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because it affects every area of your life.
    <br>You read the Bible, it will not come alive.
    <br>It is this heart that converts what you are reading.
    <br>You read and take it to the conversion room;
    <br>the conversion room will convert it and send it to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Oh my God, I hope you quite understand what I am talking about.
    <br>Let me use the Bible as a good example of what I am talking about.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is my Bible.
    <br>I open my Bible, I would read: "The Lord would have compassion on Jacob".
    <br>What I have just read now, would be taken to the heart.
    <br>If it does not go to the heart, it is just mere literature, words.
    <br>I have read it now. For that Word to be real and to be alive, it needs to be taken to the heart.
    <br>The heart would now convert the Word. After converting the Word, it would send it the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The Holy Spirit would now be affecting it.
    <br>It would now become an instrument of healing, blessing, salvation and deliverance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I hope you understand the word conversion.
    <br>It means to refine.
    <br>When you take gold, it needs to pass through the furnace for refining.
    <br>So also, the Word you are reading now, "The Lord would have compassion for Jacob".
    <br>This is the Word but it would go straight to the heart
    <br>and the heart would now refine it.
    <br>When the heart refines it, it would now join the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God
    <br>and then, it becomes an instrument.
    <br>Heart means man's spirit.
    <br>But if your heart is holding grudges,
    <br>if your heart is holding pain,
    <br>if your heart is holding hatred, it would not go there.
    <br>Only one thing occupies the heart.
    <br>Once hatred is there, nothing can go there.
    <br>Unless your heart is clear, you have a free heart.
    <br>When you have that free spirit, there is no hatred in your heart,
    <br>you don't hold grudges, you don't have anything against anyone,
    <br>your heart is free, that means a free spirit.
    <br>Then, the Word can go there, be converted, join to the Spirit of the Father
    <br>and become an instrument to use.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is in your heart? A lot.
    <br>Heart means man's spirit. What is in your spirit? A lot.
    <br>That is why this Word you are reading will continue to be literature - history about Jacob.
    <br>If my heart is not free, I am just reading about Jacob.
    <br>It is history about Jacob unless it is taken to the heart, the heart converts it, refines it
    <br>and joins it to the Spirit of the Father.
    <br>When He joins it to the Spirit of the Father,
    <br>it becomes an instrument of healing, deliverance and salvation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask yourself, "What is in my heart?" Your heart is full of the past.
    <br>People that have hurt you. People that have hated you. People that have cheated you.
    <br>People that have embarrassed you.
    <br>At a lot of the places you worked in the past, they refused to pay you.
    <br>You spent one year in a company and they refused to pay you this money. You will never forgive them.
    <br>If you want to know a true Christian. Just go near, when he is praying.
    <br>Through his prayer, you would know whether he is a Christian or not.
    <br>"Oh God, I rebuke him, I kill him.
    <br>God, I bulldoze him. I will not forgive him. In the name of Jesus."
    <br>You would know that this one is not a Christian.
    <br>That is when he would be vomiting the pain in his heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour:
    <br>What is in your heart?
    <br>Now you know the meaning of free heart.
    <br>Heart means man's spirit - a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a heart that lets go of offence.
    <br>Once the heart lets go of offence, when you are reading your Bible,
    <br>it will go straight to your heart and your heart will refine it,
    <br>take it to the Holy Ghost, join them together and it will become an instrument.
    <br>But if your heart is not free from all this pain, people that have embarrassed you,
    <br>you can never see the Bible alive or real.
    <br>You continue to read your Bible as if you are reading James Hadley Chase - history.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The society has cheated you.
    <br>You are a professor, you have PhD, you are jobless.
    <br>The society has cheated you, that's another offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are working under someone who has no certificate, and you have PhD.
    <br>And this person that has no certificate is your boss.
    <br>Anytime you see him and he calls you, "Come on. Give me that file",
    <br>you ask yourself, "Ah, I have PhD. This one is an illiterate".
    <br>You would still carry that file, with pain.
    <br>You would now carry the file.
    <br>"I know my name"
    <br>You carry the file.
    <br>"Put it here!"
    <br>"Yes, sir."
    <br>You now look at his neck...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All the time you look at your boss who always instructs you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The race is not always for the swiftest or fastest.
    <br>If you are better than your boss in every area of life -
    <br>stature, wisdom, understanding, education, human natural gifts -
    <br>you realise that you are better than him, and he is your boss -
    <br>don't forget that the race is not always for the swiftest.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God put you there to learn some lessons.
    <br>Your journey is not going to stop there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You always talk as if your journey would end there.
    <br>What you are talking about is just one out of history in your life.
    <br>You would soon leave the place. You are going to encounter a lot and a lot.
    <br>If God is preparing you for greatness,
    <br>He would prepare you for that greatness.
    <br>How does God prepare people for greatness?
    <br>He would take you from stupid, through rustic people, illerate people;
    <br>he wants you to understand everything.
    <br>He will allow you to pass through all those foolish things.
    <br>So that when you get to that position, you would understand what it is to be a rustic boy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are many heroes today that are not from God.
    <br>Not every hero or societal people are from God.
    <br>There are many that are not from God.
    <br>This is why God said, "The peace that I am giving you is not as the world gives".
    <br>It means the success I am giving you, is different from the one the world gives.
    <br>God himself declares that the world can give success,
    <br>but my own success is quite different from the one the world gives to its people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If now you see someone in a high position, successful, you need to ask,
    <br>"Is this God's success or the world's success?"
    <br>Sometimes, if God is taking you to a high place, He would even allow you to work under the world's success.
    <br>He would allow you to work under criminals.
    <br>He would allow you to work under stupid people.
    <br>But He would protect you.
    <br>The little time He would allow you to work there, He would protect you.
    <br>Because He is preparing you for....
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is God.
    <br>You must have a degree in love and also in hatred.
    <br>So that when you occupy that position, you will be able to explain, you will be able to understand what it is,
    <br>what it means to go through hatred.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God always makes us fit for the position.
    <br>He makes us fit for it. He would train us.
    <br>You should be ready for God's training.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, once again.
    <br>Take this word: Our heart refines the Word in the Bible.
