  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, you are welcome back to the program.
    <br>And right now, we have our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua in our midst.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Sir, we received a lot of emails, a multitude of emails from people all around the world
    <br>who have a question regarding meditation - your last message concerning meditation.
    <br>Out of a multitude of those emails, we want to read the most popular question from these emails, sir.
    <br>And the question goes:
    <br>How do we compare meditation to reading and committing to memory?
    <br>OK.
    <br>They are taking me back to the last meeting.
    <br>- If I'm right?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>I'm ready to do every proper thing for the salvation of their souls.
    <br>Nothing is too big to do.
    <br>How do we compare meditation to reading and committing to memory?
    <br>OK.
    <br>How do we compare meditation to reading and committing to memory?
    <br>Meditation is inwardly-received truth.
    <br>It is feeding on Christ, who is the Living Word.
    <br>Viewers,
    <br>Christ Himself is with us in the Living Word
    <br>because Christ and His Living Word are one.
    <br>Not just reading the Word and committing to memory, which is valuable, good -
    <br>which many of us today do for the purpose of preaching the Gospel,
    <br>for the purpose of teaching the Gospel and counselling.
    <br>We have forgotten that you cannot build one up spiritually on the history of the Word.
    <br>We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>Meditation is not just about the theory and the history of the Word
    <br>but also about living in the Word and the Word living in us.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Sir, I can see one question that comes from our viewer called Peter from Zimbabwe.
    <br>A little bit worried, he said:
    <br>Good Morning, Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>How can the Word of God work through us?
    <br>Man of God, the reason I'm asking this is because I have studied the Word of God for years,
    <br>but I'm still not seeing the Word of God work through me.
    <br>If I may take you to the Book of John
    <br>chapter 8, verse 31.
    <br>True disciples.
    <br>"Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him,
    <br>'If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples;
    <br>and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.'
    <br>They answered him, 'We are descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone.
    <br>What do you mean by saying, "You will be made free"?'
    <br>Jesus answered them, 'Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.
    <br>The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever.
    <br>So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.' "
    <br>The question you are asking me is simple.
    <br>It is highly profitable to store the Word of God in our hearts.
    <br>Jesus said in John 8:31-32, "If you abide in Me and My Word abides in you, you are My disciples indeed.
    <br>You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free."
    <br>Back to the question.
    <br>The more the Word of God we inwardly receive,
    <br>the more we resist sin, the more we resist temptation.
    <br>The Word of God can only work through us when we inwardly receive it.
    <br>One may study the Word of God for years.
    <br>If he does not act it, live it, he is not a doer of the Word.
    <br>The Book of James 1:22 says, "Be the doer of the Word, not the hearer only."
    <br>Viewers, be the doer of the Word, not the hearer only.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>It reminds me when you said that if you take the Word of God to heart
    <br>and truly make it part of you,
    <br>it will by its very nature change you and you will find yourself called to act with God.
    <br>We have more questions, sir, from our viewers that actually concern this topic.
    <br>This gentleman is actually a bishop of a large ministry, and he writes this:
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, how do you say, "Be healed" and there will be healing?
    <br>Man of God, I'm a bishop with thousands of members and branches.
    <br>It is my desire to see myself in the ministry of healing one day,
    <br>for I have studied the Word of God for years.
    <br>- It is similar to the former question.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Many Bible students deceive themselves because they are not acting, living or doing the Word.
    <br>Because the Bible says:
    <br>The Living Word in us is equivalent to Christ being in us.
    <br>So, what are we talking about?
    <br>Today, we memorise Scripture
    <br>when the thoughts of the Bible are from the Spirit.
    <br>How can you memorise something from the Spirit?
    <br>To memorise things is mental assent - intellectual.
    <br>Today, we memorise Scripture when the thoughts of the Bible are from the Spirit
    <br>and the language, from men.
    <br>That cannot work!
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 12:3: "No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the help of the Holy Spirit."
    <br>That does not mean people will not say, "Jesus is Lord," without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>This is what we are facing today.
    <br>This is the cause of the crisis, the disunity in the Church of God.
    <br>This is the cause of misunderstanding, misinterpretation.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>If you can allow us to take one more question...
    <br>... from your parents.
    <br>From the viewers, sir.
    <br>The question says: My dear prophet,
    <br>how do I resist sin - I mean, temptation?
    <br>I have studied the Bible for years and read the Bible many times
    <br>but I still don't have the courage to resist sin and temptation.
    <br>When we look at 1 Corinthians 2:4-5,
    <br>God's power works through His Word and His Spirit to bring a new birth,
    <br>to bring a real Christian,
    <br>to bring a real bishop, to bring a real born-again.
    <br>God's power works through His Word and His Spirit.
    <br>When you say, "In Jesus' name," that should be through His Word and His Spirit.
    <br>He speaks to us through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>"In Jesus' name!" - that should be through His Word and His Spirit.
    <br>"Be healed!" - through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>The Spirit makes us to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>Because you believe, you receive.
    <br>The instant you believe, the instant you receive.
    <br>"Let there be light!" - and there is light.
    <br>To resist sin and temptation - through His Word and His Spirit.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>The thoughts of the Bible are from the Spirit and the language, from men;
    <br>language from you people, language from us.
    <br>It is the Spirit that actualises it all - makes it happen.
    <br>So, take your time to read the Book of Psalms 119:130 and verse 99.
    <br>I want to leave you here.
    <br>You have other questions?
    <br>So, I want to really pray with the viewers.
    <br>You can have your seats and let's pray together.
    <br>For the hearts that receive this message, ask God to forgive you of every inconsistency in your life.
    <br>You intend to do the right thing but you find yourself doing the wrong thing.
    <br>You spirit of inconsistency - be rebuked, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be rebuked, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I free you today, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Determine to set aside a special time with devotion and read your Bible with forgiveness.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Amen.
