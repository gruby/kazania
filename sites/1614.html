  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We glorify God because of your position before God.
    <br>If I'm right - I'm talking to you.
    <br>What is your position?
    <br>You have a covenant with God.
    <br>You are on the right hand of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It shall be permanent.
    <br>I want to believe you know God genuinely now, not by emotions.
    <br>The way you answer is not...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have been seeing how the name Jesus has been working in the Spirit.
    <br>You know, Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>No doubt about that.
    <br>But before now...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm happy to hear that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The question remains: How do we know God?
    <br>Can somebody answer my question?
    <br>I think we know God by His works, by what we see,
    <br>having faith in the fact that He is able.
    <br>Good. You are right.
    <br>I always know God according to when I sometimes think negatively,
    <br>I see the evidence of God in my life, I say, "Oh God"
    <br>and if I want to have passion to do something, something is discouraging me
    <br>but when I see what God did for me, I will always have the urge to do it.
    <br>We know God because God said to us in His Word, "I am who I am".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Mystery.
    <br>See the angle it is taking us to - "I am who I am."
    <br>Ok, any other?
    <br>We know God by reading the Bible slowly, attentively
    <br>Where is your Bible?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good. Thank you.
    <br>The reason why I am asking this question - because of your position right now.
    <br>I can see someone who knows God.
    <br>We know God because we have been doing His will, since morning, till now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok, go there.
    <br>The body doesn't know God but the inner man knows God through His Spirit.
    <br>We hear a lot of definitions today -
    <br>biological, chemistry, history, geography definition.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Man of God, I believe we know God by His deeds.
    <br>The miracles we have seen have made us to know Him more and love Him more.
    <br>Miracle, miracle - when they hear miracle, miracle of money, isn't?
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>We know God by His reliability and truth.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We know God by the encounter we have with Him and revelation.
    <br>Encounter - in business.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Praise God.
    <br>We know God by hearing His Word, keeping the Word and meditating on His Word.
    <br>You do that?
    <br>Yes, by His grace, sir.
    <br>Why putting grace again? You do that?
    <br>I do that, sir. By showing love to...
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Man of God, we know God by how we believe,
    <br>what God is using His prophet to do.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok, come here.
    <br>Somebody must represent the gallery. Just one person there.
    <br>Just someone - a female and male.
    <br>We know God by faith, by believing in God.
    <br>That is why we are here - because we believe in God.
    <br>Female next.
    <br>We know God through His Word and His deeds. Praise the Lord.
    <br>Thank you. We have said it all.
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks.
    <br>The Word He speaks represents His heart.
    <br>The Word God speaks represents His heart.
    <br>What is God's heart?
    <br>His will, His promises.
    <br>God's promises are only recorded in the Bible.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To know His promises, one must know His Word.
    <br>What are God's promises - I mean, God's will?
    <br>To know His will, one must know His Word.
    <br>Without His promises, our faith is not real faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Without God's promises, my faith is not real faith".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Without God's promises, my faith is not real faith.]
    <br>When God has not promised something and you begin to say, "I want this",
    <br>when God has not promised healing and you start saying, "Heal me" -
    <br>that faith is not real faith.
    <br>Let His will be done.
    <br>Without God's promises, our faith is not real faith.
    <br>The promises of God are in the Bible.
    <br>As in the Book of Romans 10:17
    <br>So, faith comes through His Word.
