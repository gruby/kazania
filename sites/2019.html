    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>I want to take you back because there is a lot you have lost -
    <br>lost time,
    <br>lost hope,
    <br>lost dreams.
    <br>I remember when I was very young - all my dreams are what are coming to fulfilment.
    <br>When something happens to me, I will remember - "Ah, I dreamt it!"
    <br>When I was in secondary school, in those days, those dreams I used to have -
    <br>each has been coming to pass, one by one.
    <br>I believe that if your dreams had been coming to pass, you would not be where you are today.
    <br>You are not created to be tail but to be head.
    <br>You have lost dreams - a lot of dreams.
    <br>If you recall your dreams in the past, ten to twenty years ago,
    <br>you will remember that those dreams have not come to pass.
    <br>Where you ate with kings, queens, presidents of nations and you found yourself in the palace -
    <br>yet, you have never been to the palace until now.
    <br>Right now, let us go to that which we have lost.
    <br>Let us go to that which we have lost.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Let us go to that which we have lost.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Let us go to that which we have lost.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Right now begin to recollect, recover your lost dreams.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Begin to recover your lost dreams.
    <br>I command you right now to recover your lost dreams.
    <br>You once dreamt you were a king but today, you are on the street.

    <br>You once dreamt, seeing yourself as a president of a nation but today, you are still on the street.
    <br>PRAYER TO RECOVER YOUR LOST DREAMS!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>You once dreamt, seeing yourself in a palace, controlling a palace,
    <br>but today, you know the opposite is what you are doing now.
    <br>PRAYER TO RECOVER YOUR LOST DREAMS!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>You once dreamt, seeing yourself with a crown and people were bowing before you.
    <br>Today, you are still on the street.
    <br>PRAYER TO RECOVER YOUR LOST DREAMS!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>I command you to recover your lost dreams, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your lost dreams, recover them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Those dreams are not just for fun, they are not nightmares; they are real.
    <br>Are you listening to me?
    <br>If those dreams were nightmares, I would not recollect mine.
    <br>They are not nightmares but to you, you see them as nightmares.
    <br>Nowadays, when you dream seeing yourself eating with a president of a nation,
    <br>and the president of a nation is giving you a cheque or a command, you consider it a nightmare
    <br>because you have been dreaming in the past and nothing came to fulfilment.
    <br>Your lost hope and your lost dreams, in the name of Jesus, recover them!
    <br>Recover them!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to recover them.
    <br>This is anointing upon you to recover all you have lost -
    <br>all your loss!
    <br>PRAYER TO RECOVER YOUR LOST DREAMS!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I release you from the influence of ancestral cycle!
    <br>The same thing that happened to your brother is the same thing that is happening to you now.
    <br>The same thing that happened to your sister is the same thing that is happening to you.
    <br>What is happening in the house is what is happening to you.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes, what is happening in the house is what is happening to you.
    <br>What is happening to your family is what is happening to you.
    <br>This is ancestral cycle.
    <br>I release you from that influence!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to release yourself!
    <br>PRAYER TO RECOVER YOUR LOST DREAMS!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every area of your life seems not complete.
    <br>Even your marriage, your business, your career, seem not complete.
    <br>With the name of Jesus, we can restore that which is required to complete your marriage.
    <br>In your walking with the Lord, there are some areas that are not complete.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to restore that which is required to complete your walking with the Lord,
    <br>your marriage - open your lips!
    <br>PRAYER TO RECOVER YOUR LOST DREAMS!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.
