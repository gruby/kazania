    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Gather In The UK To Receive The New Morning Water
    <br>You're welcome in Jesus' name to the Emmanuel TV partner meeting here in London, UK.
    <br>I'm Mark Kenwright, and I'm from Cornwall.
    <br>My wife and I are looking forward to receiving the New Morning Water,
    <br>meeting with the Emmanuel TV team and receiving from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>My name is Elin. I come from Scotland.
    <br>So you have travelled all the way down from Scotland to attend this special meeting?
    <br>Yes, I have.
    <br>Amen! What are your expectations from today's meeting?
    <br>Big transformation, and I will see everything become new.
    <br>The reason why I came here is because I want to share the New Morning Water
    <br>with all my friends in Hong Kong and all over the world.
    <br>It's not just for me, it's going to bless everyone.
    <br>People should watch Emmanuel TV and believe in God. That everything is possible with Him.
    <br>Emmanuel TV is changing lives, changing the world, changing everything.
    <br>Amen! It's certainly changing lives, changing the world in Jesus' name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>My name is Ruby. I come from Stockholm, Sweden.
    <br>So, you mean you flew in straight from Sweden, just for the meeting today?
    <br>Exactly. I am just excited to be here and looking forward to what God is going to do today in our lives.
    <br>Based on what I have already watched on Emmanuel TV and the experience in South Africa,
    <br>I am looking forward to another time of God's goodness and power
    <br>flowing through this medium of the New Morning Water,
    <br>bringing deliverance, healing and salvation to all that are here.
    <br>I believe that people are really expectant to receive their breakthrough before they leave.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are watching,
    <br>I would encourage you to be part of the Emmanuel TV partnership.
    <br>It's such a blessing, a great privilege to be part of this ministry.
    <br>Thousands and thousands of people are being reached through Emmanuel TV partnership.
    <br>It's another way to express your love.
    <br>Your giving will go a long way to bless many lives, restore hopeless situations
    <br>and give them hope and another chance for them to see life where there seems to be no life.
    <br>So, be part of Emmanuel TV partnership and you will be blessed.
    <br>Emmanuel! It's a new beginning! Amen!
    <br>Thank you very much. My name is Margarita.
    <br>I am an Italian living in Dublin. I came from Ireland this morning.
    <br>It's a great honour being here at this meeting.
    <br>My expectation is very big.
    <br>I expect my life to change greatly.
    <br>I have a business with my husband - an online business.
    <br>I expect prosperity, breakthrough in my life and in the life of my husband.
    <br>That's why as soon as I got the invitation, I came. I didn't hesitate at all.
    <br>I know this is a great instrument - this New Morning Water.
    <br>It's a great instrument of blessing for this 2018.
    <br>I am a partner since 2006.
    <br>Since then, I saw my life improving.
    <br>Now, I have a good job. I graduated and I never lack.
    <br>If you don't give, you will never receive.
    <br>So, I advise you to be a partner of Emmanuel TV because the reaching out and helping
    <br>that the Emmanuel TV family is doing is so mighty and great.
    <br>It's a real honour to be part of this project.
    <br>Banquet Held During The Emmanuel TV Partner Meeting In The UK
    <br>The Emmanuel TV partner meeting in London, UK, where the partners from all over Europe have gathered
    <br>together, specially invited by Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>Right now, as they have shared a meal together, we want to hear from some of them.
    <br>Can you tell us your name and where you are from?
    <br>Yes. My name is Natalia and I'm from Sweden.
    <br>I'm originally from Iraq but I live in Sweden.
    <br>So you mean you flew in all the way from Sweden to be here with us today?
    <br>Yes, absolutely.
    <br>Wonderful! Can you tell us your expectations of the meeting today with the Emmanuel TV partners?
    <br>Wow! I know it's like a blessing to me and to all of us here.
    <br>I'm really so happy to see so many people that came from a lot of different countries.
    <br>My mum and I are praying to have such a meeting in Sweden, so I'm really happy.
    <br>What can you say about the New Morning Water which Prophet T.B. Joshua sent specifically for the partners?
    <br>Wow! I don't know what to say, but we saw some videos on Emmanuel TV and we were so happy.
    <br>We were praying that God should send that New Morning Water to us and
    <br>He listened to our prayers. So, we are very happy.
    <br>It's not about the money or anything because God will pay back so much more.
    <br>I mean blessings, good health. So it's not like you give and you don't receive.
    <br>God blesses you more and more, the more you give.
    <br>And of course, you give with love.
    <br>We would like to hear a word from your mother.
    <br>Can she tell us her name first?
    <br>My name is Mona George, and I'm originally from Iraq but I live in Sweden.
    <br>What's your expectation from the Emmanuel TV partner meeting today?
    <br>I'm very happy to be here and I'm so happy to see the Emmanuel TV team here in the UK.
    <br>We're praying, of course, for you to come to Sweden and visit us.
    <br>We saw on Emmanuel TV how the people got delivered just by touching the water.
    <br>It's really a blessing from the prophet of God to send that New Morning Water to us.
    <br>It's a blessing to our lives.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>My name Nelson Gil Gomez. I'm from Portugal living in Manchester.
    <br>You've come from Manchester to London today for the meeting?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What can you say about being an Emmanuel TV partner? How has it changed your life?
    <br>It has changed many things in my life because the first time when I went to Nigeria,
    <br>I was separated from my wife.
    <br>After that, we reconciled and I am back together with my wife.
    <br>So, we are very happy.
    <br>I just want to advise everyone to be a partner of Emmanuel TV and The SCOAN
    <br>because it's a place where people feel good and where you can see a lot of miracles.
    <br>So, I advise them to become Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>My first language is Portuguese, but I try my best in English.
    <br>Expectations of the Emmanuel TV

    <br>I'm from the UK. I live in York but I'm South African.
    <br>When I was collecting the New Morning Water, I started shaking.
    <br>I felt like there was electricity all over my hand.
    <br>I couldn't hold the booklet and the New Morning Water, so I fell and I started rolling on the floor.
    <br>I felt like something was shocking me when I was trying to pick up the New Morning Water,
    <br>so, I wasn't able to pick it up. I ended up falling.
    <br>For me, It's a new beginning and all my problems have come to an end.
    <br>I know it's a new beginning this year for me. Thank You, Jesus.

    <br>This is my husband beside me - my loving husband Fred.
    <br>It's a great experience.
    <br>It's actually something that I cannot really explain.
    <br>The Holy Spirit actually took control of today and
    <br>I know our story has changed from this moment in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! And we saw when you went up to receive your own New Morning Water
    <br>sent to you by Prophet T.B. Joshua. We saw the reaction.
    <br>You were under the influence of the Holy Spirit. What happened to you?
    <br>I can't really explain what happened. I found myself on the floor.
    <br>I think the presence of the Holy Spirit took total control of me.
    <br>I believe I've been delivered by His special grace in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I feel free, I feel joy inside of me, I feel light, I feel happy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Receiving

    <br>My name is Aderonke Adesanya.
    <br>I originally come from Nigeria but I live in Ireland.
    <br>I could feel the presence of God from inside out, and immediately we were asked to be on the queue,
    <br>I was vibrating from my head to my toes. I just thank God for today.
    <br>We saw what happened when you went forward to receive your own New Morning Water.
    <br>What actually happened to me was something I knew wasn't right.
    <br>I sometimes dream seeing things from my father's house.
    <br>But today, the Lord just let me know that it is finished.
    <br>I trembled in awe of His faithfulness.
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>I'm very fine. I'm okay.
    <br>I thank God for His faithfulness.
    <br>My name is Marco, and I'm from Russia.
    <br>Sir, can you tell us - what was your experience at the partner meeting today in the UK?
    <br>We are partners from all over the world. I came from Russia.
    <br>We were gifted with the New Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to the UK.
    <br>God is real and powerful. He loves us, so He immediately delivered people.
    <br>Some manifested.
    <br>The power of God is here with us at this event.
    <br>The revival in Europe has started.
    <br>It starts from today in London, UK.
    <br>I will use the New Morning Water on my family, friends and all the needy that will come my way.
    <br>I believe that God who sent us to apply the New Morning Water will show us His love,
    <br>His power to deliver, heal and save people.
    <br>And I want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for his love and his care for humanity
    <br>because he's a man of humanity, not just for Christians.
    <br>He's a wonderful gift that God gave to our generation.
    <br>I'm Shiromi Ternborg.
    <br>I'm originally from Sri Lanka but I came now from Sweden.
    <br>And today, you are here for the New Morning Water meeting.
    <br>Here in London for the first time, the New Morning Water has come to Europe, sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What was your experience of today?
    <br>Love.
    <br>I experienced His great love.
    <br>I'm so grateful that God knew me even before I was formed in my mother's womb
    <br>and that He has called me by my name and has chosen me.
    <br>God is going to do mighty things and our past is over.
    <br>God has begun a new thing. I'm so grateful because I can be a vessel of God now.
    <br>We thank God for your life and we thank you so much for being a partner of Emanuel TV
    <br>and joining us in Christ's mission to change lives, nations and the world.
    <br>We just want to encourage you that as you continue to be part of Christ's mission,
    <br>the best is yet to come in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My name is Natalia. I'm originally from Iraq but I'm living in Sweden.
    <br>Today, you were here for the New Morning Water meeting. What was your experience of today?
    <br>There are no words to describe it.
    <br>I'm so happy to be here and to see all the brothers and sisters from all around the world,
    <br>and to receive this New Morning Water is like receiving Jesus' presence
    <br>because we could feel Jesus' presence all over the place.
    <br>I'm very happy.
    <br>I saw a lot of people that got delivered and they were vomiting out substances.
    <br>Demons could not resist Jesus' presence here, it was really great.
    <br>A lot of people got delivered, and for sure, blessed now too.
    <br>What message are you going to be taking back home to your people
    <br>concerning what you saw and what you heard?
    <br>Wow. It's all about love.
    <br>Jesus loves us so we have to love one another.
    <br>This is something that I have really learned from the Prophet and from the messages that we heard here.
    <br>That we should hold no offence, no matter what.
    <br>Jesus is love and we should show love and give love and God will bless us for that, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
