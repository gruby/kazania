  <p>    
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Wherever you are, you, evil spirits that are tormenting my people,
    <br>I say out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You, evil spirit, out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua calls forward one of those who had manifested during the Mass Prayer for deliverance.
    <br>He stumbles and falls to the floor as he receives prayer in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>I am Lucifer.
    <br>You are a Lucifer?
    <br>Yes, I am. I am not a Lucifer. I am Lucifer.
    <br>Can't you hear me? Come on.
    <br>The young man says he is Lucifer.
    <br>You said what?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Oh, come on! Stop that!
    <br>The DOWNFALL Of Lucifer!!!
    <br>Look at the legs!
    <br>Put your leg down!
    <br>Put it down!
    <br>Raise your hands!
    <br>Raise them up!
    <br>The DOWNFALL Of Lucifer!!!
    <br>What?
    <br>Don't touch me! Please, don't touch me!
    <br>Stop that!
    <br>The DOWNFALL Of Lucifer!!!
    <br>Please!
    <br>I'm begging you! Please!
    <br>Ah!
    <br>Gosh!
    <br>The DOWNFALL Of Lucifer!!!
    <br>You did not have to do that!
    <br>Why are you tormenting me? Why?
    <br>The DOWNFALL Of Lucifer!!!
    <br>You're tormenting me!
    <br>He's my body!
    <br>He's my temple!
    <br>I've come here to The Synagogue and you people have been tormenting me!
    <br>I only have business with him; I don't have with others.
    <br>The floor should start fighting you now!
    <br>Don't do that. Please!
    <br>You said what?
    <br>Watch your screen. This is Lucifer running away.
    <br>Leave him!
    <br>The ground should start fighting you!
    <br>The DOWNFALL Of Lucifer!!!
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>Now, the chair should start fighting you!
    <br>Chair, start fighting!
    <br>The ground, fight!
    <br>The DOWNFALL Of Lucifer!!!
    <br>That is the downfall of Lucifer.
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>He doesn't know that the ground is a messenger of God.
    <br>So, where can he run to?
    <br>If the ground needs my assistance, I will give my assistance.
    <br>So, we are not fighting ourselves.
    <br>He is a servant of God, and I am a servant of God.
    <br>The evil spirit who called himself Lucifer attempts to attack Prophet T.B. Joshua with the chair.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>Be on the floor!
    <br>Raise up your hands!
    <br>Close your eyes!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Adeleye Oluwasegun.
    <br>This is my dad, and this is my mum.
    <br>I'm a student. I'm studying biochemistry.
    <br>I'm in my final year, 400 level.
    <br>I belonged to a fellowship on campus.
    <br>We'd go out on village outreach and evangelism.
    <br>When we used to go, we'd pray and minister deliverance to people.
    <br>I was privileged to minister deliverance once and the demons inside him
    <br>manifested and I thought it was over.
    <br>After that, I started experiencing a lot of demonic attacks.
    <br>I started experiencing a lot of cobwebs.
    <br>Whenever I was in a prayer session and they mentioned the name Jesus,
    <br>I'd become very, very angry, violent and abusive.
    <br>There was an occasion that I went up to a person who was ministering
    <br>and I pulled him by the collar.
    <br>I wanted to kill him but the other brothers held me.
    <br>In the fellowship, we were being taught and our faith was built.
    <br>So, we essentially acted on that faith, though we were not anointed or ordained.
    <br>We read the Bible and it says that whosoever believes shall cast out demons.
    <br>We went in faith, casting out demons.
    <br>Thank you so much for delivering me.
    <br>We had been to so many places for this predicament until we came here.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Emmanuel! I'm free now.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Adeleye Idowu and this is my wife, Wunmi Adeleye.
    <br>and this is my son, Segun Adeleye.
    <br>We sent him to university. He is in 400 level, as he said earlier on.
    <br>Some time last year September, we got a call from the school
    <br>that he had become a deliverance minister and started behaving strangely.
    <br>We were wondering because at my level where I am in the church of God,
    <br>I'm a Sunday school teacher and I know what it takes to be a deliverance minister.
    <br>Unless you are called and anointed, you cannot do it because we have different gifts from God.
    <br>Where God puts you, you have be content with it,
    <br>unless He asks you to move forward. That was why I was shocked.
    <br>When we came in contact with each other, I asked some questions
    <br>regarding what really happened.
    <br>It was then I learnt that they usually went out to deliver people.
    <br>I wondered if what he was doing was not above his capacity.
    <br>The first question I asked him,
    <br>'Do you have the power? Do you have the anointing?
    <br>Can you just do it anyhow you like it?'
    <br>The repercussions might be great.
    <br>Truly, Man of God, it was great.
    <br>Since that time, he had been possessed.
    <br>We had been to many places but all to no avail until we came here.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>When we came here, he was delivered just like that.
    <br>I now know that the power of God really abides here and with the man of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
