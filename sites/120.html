    <br>ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL IN THE UK - DELIVERANCE CONTINUES
    <br>There is power in the name of Jesus
    <br>Lord to give up I'd be a fool
    <br>You are my all in all
    <br>Jesus Lamb of God
    <br>Worthy is Your Name
    <br>We want them to be mad!
    <br>These kids are great.
    <br>She is a seer.
    <br>Who are you, you evil spirit?
    <br>She is delivering nations, this one.
    <br>Who are you, you evil spirit?
    <br>Spirit of snake.
    <br>We are spiritual snakes. We were brought into her life to destroy her destiny.
    <br>She is going to speak about the future, about the past, about the present.
    <br>You spirit of snake, what have you done to her life?
    <br>We don't want that; you know that; you know our kingdom is in danger.
    <br>Why?
    <br>How long have you been in this body?
    <br>Since birth; we knew her plan.
    <br>This woman, what is her occupation, what does she do?
    <br>She is doing nothing.
    <br>What have you done to her family, her home, her marriage?
    <br>We brought the spirit of madness; we want them to be mad.
    <br>They are great, these kids.
    <br>We have got to tempt them all - six of them.
    <br>Why?
    <br>You evil spirit, with all your evil plans for this family and for this woman...
    <br>That name is dangerous!
    <br>Which name?
    <br>She is trying to call it - no way.
    <br>Which name?
    <br>That name she is trying to speak now.
    <br>Which name?
    <br>We can't say it; we are in danger!
    <br>She was given a volcanic anointing fire to burn all of us.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Why? Don't call that name!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Please, we are dying; please don't!
    <br>Why do you not want that Name to be called?
    <br>Why do you have to call that Name? Why? Why?
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, come out of her, in Jesus' name!
    <br>We are dying.
    <br>Come out! You have no place in this body.
    <br>You and your nonsense plans, you are coming out, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Every chain that has been holding her destiny, let it be loosed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let every chain be loosed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>This is deliverance taking place in Jesus' name right now.
    <br>The evil spirit said it was a spirit of snake that had caused madness in the family.
    <br>But right now we are seeing the name of Jesus Christ taking authority over this demonic spirit,
    <br>as she is being completely set free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You are free; rise up, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus!
    <br>ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL IN THE UK - TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Linda Nambili.
    <br>I come from Namibia and I came to visit the UK for six months.
    <br>The problems that brought me here were spiritual attacks and no progress in life.
    <br>When we were going to the prayer line, I couldn't walk.
    <br>Something was pulling me, like muscles pulling in my leg.
    <br>Before I reached there, I found that I couldn't see anyone else.
    <br>There was just darkness, and I was screaming.
    <br>From there, a voice was talking from deep within me; I couldn't control it.
    <br>It was speaking against my control.
    <br>So, you were experiencing spiritual attack, but by the grace of God you came to the Anointing Water service
    <br>and were ministered to with the Anointing Water, and Jesus Christ met you. Amen?
    <br>Amen! Hallelujah!
    <br>Now that you have received this wonderful deliverance,
    <br>we encourage you to stay close to Jesus and far from sin, so that this will remain permanent in your life.
    <br>Amen; thank You, Lord Jesus; I am free!
