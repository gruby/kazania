  <p>    
    <br>A message the Lord said I should give to my African Continent:
    <br>No African country can succeed alone.
    <br>Africans need each other to develop.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Africans need each other to develop.]
    <br>West Africa needs Southern Africa to develop.
    <br>Southern Africa needs West Africa to develop.
    <br>North Africa needs East Africa to develop
    <br>and East Africa needs North Africa to develop.
    <br>No one is self-sufficient.
    <br>We cannot do without each other.
    <br>Everyone has a contribution.
    <br>Whether you are poor, rich or an immigrant,
    <br>everyone has a contribution for the development of Africa, at the level we are now.
    <br>Dear Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.
    <br>With regard to the issue of illegal immigrants, drugs and other crimes,
    <br>our duty is to inform law enforcement agencies.
    <br>That is our duty - to give them useful information about issues like that.
    <br>In our respective countries, our duty is to inform law enforcement agencies.
    <br>It is only when they fail to carry out their duty that we citizens can lawfully protest.
    <br>I want to show you a little video before I continue talking.
    <br>There is no country in Africa that is not involved in what you are about to watch.
    <br>What is the cause?
    <br>It's because Africa has neglected her youth
    <br>Africa has neglected her youth.
    <br>The youth - they have neglected them.
    <br>Africa has abandoned the youth to themselves
    <br>whereas tomorrow's Africa is the youth.
    <br>But we have neglected them - that is the cause of all this frustration.
    <br>When I think about the future of Africa, I have sleepless nights.
    <br>Please, can you play this cassette for me - please, let's watch.
    <br>In the mediterranean, off the coast of Libya,
    <br>this unstable fishing boat is overloaded with migrants and refugees.
    <br>So there is a horrible inevitability in what is about to happen.
    <br>The boat is starting to tilt.
    <br>Then the situation becomes so much worse.
    <br>Many jump into the waters of the mediterranean before the boat completely capsizes.
    <br>Moments later, it is completely overturned
    <br>Scores swam away from the shipwreck
    <br>but five people were found dead in the water.
    <br>But this man and 561 others were rescued.
    <br>They are now safe but the scenes of utter desperation we witnessed this time last year,
    <br>they constantly repeated themselves.
    <br>Important Message For ALL AFRICANS!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>They are your children; they are youth of Africa.
    <br>All - they are youth of Africa.
    <br>There is no country in Africa that is not represented there - all.
    <br>These are your children that claim they have travelled outside the country.
    <br>Many of them are there - looking for green pastures.
    <br>Africa has neglected her youth.
    <br>Africa has abandoned the youth to themselves.
    <br>Africa has failed to provide green pastures.
    <br>When I think about the future of Africa, I have sleepless nights.
    <br>Within Africa, if we are now fighting ourselves,
    <br>look at what is happening in other continents concerning Africa.
    <br>Within continents, there is fight among the youth.
    <br>Everything looks gloomy, frustrating, hopeless, dark, darksome, dull and  sunless.
    <br>Africa, unite!
    <br>No African country can succeed alone; we need each other to develop.
    <br>So, if we cannot understand ourselves within Africa,
    <br>do you mean they will understand us in other continents?
    <br>I was so troubled, and the Lord gave me a word:
    <br>I want to volunteer myself, and I know God has touched many Africans.
    <br>I know as I am talking, God has touched many Africans and
    <br>many Africans that are in a position to help and I know many of them are crying.
    <br>I am at your service.
    <br>I will not only sit in the church alone.
    <br>You will learn that I have travelled for a meeting with people
    <br>that are ready to talk about the challenges ahead.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, look at the ministry.
    <br>All countries, races are inside the church.
    <br>God said, "No, I release you".
    <br>He said he has touched many people that are in the position of honour and authority.
    <br>They are ready. Let's come together.
    <br>Let's talk about the youth that have been neglected.
    <br>They have been neglected.
    <br>They have been abandoned to themselves.
    <br>No provision for our youth.
    <br>When you are counting the best universities in the world,
    <br>you will hardly see a single university from Africa among 1 to 500.
    <br>There is no single African university.
    <br>Can you see the decadence?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The technology is zero.
    <br>You are flying to Dubai, you are flying to Turkey, you are flying to New York.
    <br>When are they flying into your country?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look at your age - are you not going to witness that transformation
    <br>when Africa will become a centre, where people will begin to discover themselves?
    <br>You are getting old.
    <br>Now your children, where is that future for them?
    <br>They have been abandoned.
    <br>Because they have been abandoned, that is the cause of frustration.
    <br>Frustration can make anyone to do anything.
    <br>When you realise you are a graduate and there is no job and
    <br>you are looking at your age and wondering where you are going
    <br>and every day things are becoming worse - it is frustration.
    <br>Dear Africa, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Fellow Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.
    <br>Again!
    <br>[Fellow Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.]
    <br>No African country can succeed, can develop alone.
    <br>When it now comes to the issue of people taking drugs to a country or crimes,
    <br>our duty is to work with law enforcement by giving them useful information
    <br>about these people that are doing this.
    <br>That is our duty.
    <br>But if they now fail to do so, then lawfully we can protest.
    <br>Other nations are now laying bans on immigrants;
    <br>definitely, we Africans should awake and rescue our people.
    <br>If there is ban on immigrants, definitely, this is the time we should awake.
    <br>What can we do to rescue our people?
    <br>Because these immigrants we are talking about, 90% are Africans.
    <br>So they are coming back home.
    <br>And many of them are home already.
    <br>Unemployment.
    <br>And millions are coming to join unemployment at home.
    <br>Where is the peace?
    <br>No matter how much you are blessed, you can never have peace
    <br>if people around you are suffering.
