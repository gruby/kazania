  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning everybody!
    <br>My name is Victor.
    <br>God used this Anointing Water from the anointed man, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to heal my mum from a gunshot wound.
    <br>My mum was shot nine months ago and she could not use her hand,
    <br>until I ministered this Anointing Water; now she is free!
    <br>This Anointing Water is powerful.
    <br>I want you all to use it. As you use it, may God bless you!
    <br>I have had a gunshot injury since March 16 last year (2020).
    <br>Since then, my hand has been like this.
    <br>This is my hand.
    <br>I cannot hold anything, not even a broom.
    <br>I can't pick a broom stick from the ground.
    <br>I find it difficult to use this hand because I feel a shocking sensation.
    <br>Mummy, this is the New Anointing Water from the anointed man, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ! By the grace of God.
    <br>Right now, begin to move your hand, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You are free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>What is happening to you?
    <br>VICTOR AD TESTIMONY!!!
    <br>How New Anointing Water Healed My Mum!
    <br>My hand - I cannot control the movement.
    <br>Ministration Of The New Anointing Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>That is the power of God working in your body through the Anointing Water.
    <br>VICTOR AD TESTIMONY!!!
    <br>How New Anointing Water Healed My Mum!
    <br>Mummy, you are free. Right now, begin to move your hand, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Yes, I am moving it.
    <br>Healed Through The New Anointing Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Could you do this before?
    <br>I couldn't do this before.
    <br>Now you are free, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Give thanks to God. You are free, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Healed Through The New Anointing Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Healed Through The New Anointing Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Before, I couldn't tap it like this.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I can hold my bag. I could not carry my bag before.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Let's see what happens after the ministration of the New Anointing Water.
    <br>A FEW DAYS LATER ...
    <br>Healed Through The New Anointing Water In Jesus' Name
