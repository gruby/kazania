  <p>    
    <br>Brother, marry and remarry.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What a handsome man!
    <br>What a young man!
    <br>Why did this kind of problem start with you?
    <br>I don't know, sir.
    <br>Because I see you come from one place to another place.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Where is your wife now?
    <br>You have to pray, so that this marriage will hold. There is a man between you.
    <br>You have a spiritual husband.
    <br>Yes, it's true.
    <br>You know that.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>This is your wife now, my brother.
    <br>This is your wife now. Before now you carried somebody's wife.
    <br>From one wife to another. But you - you only look for beautiful women.
    <br>Yes, sir, it's true.
    <br>Why are you looking for beautiful women?
    <br>I don't really know why.

    <br>Choir, please! What the Lord has joined together!
    <br>What God has joined together
    <br>Let no man put asunder
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Mrs. Becky Gayzee Kamibia.
    <br>I came last year because of a spiritual husband and delay in pregnancy.
    <br>Before I came here, I knew I had a spiritual husband which had been disturbing me
    <br>even before I got married.
    <br>I knew I had it because sometimes, when I was cooking in the kitchen,
    <br>I'd normally see this man in the kitchen. He would be staring at me.
    <br>So sometimes, when we were sleeping, I noticed that there was a man between me and my husband.
    <br>I'd normally get angry and at any little thing I'd flare up.
    <br>After I got married, my menstruation ceased for four years.
    <br>During the ceased menstruation I couldn't ovulate. I didn't have menstruation.
    <br>I was looking for the fruit of the womb.
    <br>We had gone to so many places but no solution.
    <br>He said we should come to The SCOAN and that I would have my deliverance.
    <br>After the deliverance, immediately as I got home, I started seeing my menstruation that month.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!
    <br>After I saw my menstruation, we met as husband and wife and I conceived.
    <br>When I told my husband I was pregnant,
    <br>he didn't believe it. He was in the bathroom bathing.
    <br>So I just ran the tests and I told him that I was pregnant. He almost fell out of the bath.
    <br>He screamed and said he couldn't believe it.
    <br>So before I delivered this baby,
    <br>I told him where I got my deliverance and that I want that Anointing Water,
    <br>that that is my tablet and I want to take the Anointing water with me.
    <br>The day of my labour, I took the Anointing Water and I put it in my bag.
    <br>During the process of delivering, the doctor said, "The cervix is open but the baby is not coming out".
    <br>I said, "Why?"
    <br>He said the contraction was not strong enough.
    <br>So the nurses were doing something.
    <br>I said: "What is the problem?"They didn't  want to tell me.
    <br>The other nurse told me that the contraction was not strong
    <br>and they didn't want to tell the doctor because they'd book me for an operation.
    <br>I said:  "You should have told me, I have the medicine in my bag." She said: "What medicine?"
    <br>She said:  "What medicine?" I said: "The Anointing Water".
    <br>She said:  "What is Anointing Water?"
    <br>I said: "Don't you have the channel here - Emmanuel TV?"
    <br>She said:  "What is Emmanuel TV?"
    <br>I said: "Don't worry. Let me deliver this baby first and I will explain it to you."
    <br>She now gave me my bag and I took the Anointing Water and I sprayed it in my mouth.
    <br>Immediately when I sprayed it in my mouth, my tummy started vibrating.
    <br>This woman  said: "The contraction is coming. Madam, this Anointing Water..."
    <br>I said: "Don't worry, let me deliver this baby."
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>The doctor now came and said:  "What is the problem?"
    <br>The nurse said: "No problem."
    <br>I took some more of the Anointing Water and immediately, as I sprayed it, the baby just came out.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Yes, this is the bouncing baby girl!
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty, as we know that the prophet shall say
    <br>that which he shall live to see accomplished.
    <br>When the prophet prophesied into her life that she was having a spiritual husband,
    <br>that there was a man lying between her and the husband,
    <br>immediately, as we know, prophecy brings about solution.
    <br>After the prophecy, she received deliverance and we can see the result of that deliverance
    <br>to prove that God Almighty has indeed granted her that complete deliverance.
    <br>As you know, that the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which is the Kingdom of Light,
    <br>is not something hoped for, it is a fact and when the Son of God says: "You are free!", you are free indeed.
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>And we can see you're holding a picture.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you tell us what is in the picture?
    <br>This is the picture when I was pregnant.
    <br>Hallelujah! We are seeing on the screen of our television
    <br>the picture of when she was pregnant and she has really documented her testimony,
    <br>as she knew that she was still coming back to give a testimony before the children of God.
    <br>And we give glory to God that today you a living testimony of the goodness of God in your life.
    <br>And can you tell us - what is your advice to those that are listening to you right now?
    <br>My advice is for you to have faith.
    <br>When you have faith, nothing is impossible for God to do.
    <br>Yes. With faith all things are possible.
    <br>And as you know that Jesus' power to heal and deliver and set us free
    <br>depends on our faith to receive.
    <br>So let us exercise that absolute faith and confidence in God Almighty
    <br>that whatever situation you may be in, God is working out the answer.
    <br>The name of my baby is Josephine.
    <br>Hallelujah!  Put your hands together for Jesus. We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
