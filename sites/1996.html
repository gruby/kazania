    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Give thanks to God for bringing you here.
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I want you to do something now, before it happens.
    <br>Confess your release before it happens.
    <br>Viewers, confess your release
    <br>because you are going to be released.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray.
    <br>It is time.
    <br>Because you have confessed your release, you know you will be released.
    <br>Now, what are we talking about?
    <br>We are talking of deliverance because if you are not delivered,
    <br>whatever you receive will face greater challenges.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you are not delivered, whatever you receive will face greater challenges."
    <br>Do you know what I mean?
    <br>If you are not delivered and someone gives you a billion dollars,
    <br>but you are still being connected with satan -
    <br>that billion dollars - you will likely use it for sickness and disease.
    <br>That is why we are talking of deliverance.
    <br>If not for bad habits, you would have no business with satan.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If not for bad habits, you would have no business with satan."
    <br>It is these bad habits he uses to connect you to himself.
    <br>It is time now to break this connection.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Stretch your hand forward.
    <br>Father, give us Your Word in our mouths so that we can speak this Word.
    <br>Your Word is the language for prayer.
    <br>Father, give us Your Word, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Whatever satan is using - that bad habit satan is using to connect you to himself,
    <br>right now, begin to break it, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Break it, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Break it!
    <br>Break that connection!

    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Watch your screen, you can see all over the auditorium, the people are being disconnected,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Many people are manifesting under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Confess it!
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Leave her!
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>You want to do what?
    <br>I want to carry my bag!
    <br>Go and carry your bag. 
    <br>Don't hold her.
    <br>Where are you going?
    <br>My bag!
    <br>It is you who carried my bag.
    <br>- It is me!
    <br>- It is you!
    <br>Give me my bag!
    <br>I said, give me my bag!
    <br>You have my bag.
    <br>Did you carry my bag?
    <br>She is looking for her bag.
    <br>- It is my bag!
    <br>- Your bag?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Help her look for her bag.
    <br>Go and look for her bag.
    <br>Go and look for your bag!
    <br>My bag!
    <br>Where did you come from?
    <br>I come from far.
    <br>- Where?
    <br>- Far.
    <br>Where are you now?
    <br>I am in a place with a lot of people.
    <br>I wanted to leave in a vehicle before.
    <br>- Who am I?
    <br>- Daddy.
    <br>But I want to go.
    <br>- You want to go?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>God is great.
    <br>What are you looking for here?
    <br>- My bag!

    <br>Give it to her.

    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>See the fire! Can you not see the fire?
    <br>The fire!
    <br>The fire reached this place but it is now on your back.
    <br>Don't cross that place!
    <br>I don't want to cross that place!
    <br>Let him carry you on his back.
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>She doesn't want to touch the ground.
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>The fire is high.
    <br>- It is high?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>What if I help you?
    <br>- If I help you pass.
    <br>- But let's pour water there first.
    <br>Go and get water!
    <br>Go and show me where the fire is.
    <br>Just show me the place.
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>It is where that boy is now.
    <br>- Where?
    <br>- This place.
    <br>This is water; go and pour the water.
    <br>- This water cannot quench it.
    <br>- Why?
    <br>- It is not enough.
    <br>- This one is here.
    <br>Pour it.
    <br>Give it to her; let her pour it.
    <br>It is for this place.
    <br>Pour it!
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Pour it! You must pour your own water!
    <br>Pour your water!
    <br>See it!
    <br>They are talking to you; you are not listening.
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Pass!
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>The water turned to fire again!
    <br>Tell us what the fire looks like.
    <br>It is tall as if they have used fuel.
    <br>It does what?
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Daddy, please, help me!
    <br>The fire is more than my power.
    <br>- I should help you?

    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>God said, "Allow your people to know what is around."
    <br>Those who are with us...
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those who are with us here, supporting us, protecting us
    <br>are more than those who are against us."

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Mrs Comfort Akpovoka, I am from Delta State.
    <br>On Sunday, I was sitting down in the congregation.
    <br>As the prayer was going on, I felt a sensation from my head to my feet.
    <br>I began to shake uncontrollably and then found myself at the front of the church.
    <br>When you found yourself at the front of the church, can you tell us what happened next?
    <br>I don't remember anything except that I was shaking.
    <br>When I came to my senses, the people I came with were telling me that I was
    <br>saying, "My bag, my bag!" "I want to go!" "Give me my bag!"
    <br>I was surprised and did not know that I was saying all those things.
    <br>It was the evil spirit that was in me that was manifesting
    <br>and I thank God that I am delivered, now.
    <br>Tell us the problem that brought you to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was having a spiritual husband and was seeing snakes in my dreams.
    <br>I was swimming in a river in my dreams but physically, I cannot swim.
    <br>Can you tell us for how many years were you having this problem of spiritual husband?
    <br>For more than 20 years, now.
    <br>How did this spiritual husband affect your life?
    <br>I didn't have anything to boast of.
    <br>In my dreams, the spiritual husband would come and sleep with me.
    <br>It made me not to have affection for my husband.
    <br>I would rather satisfy myself than have anything to do with my husband.
    <br>Your husband knows about these acts that you were involved in?
    <br>He caught me once and that was why he said that I needed deliverance.
    <br>When I slept, the spiritual husband would push my husband away from the bed.
    <br>When my husband would wake up, he would see himself on the ground.
    <br>The spiritual husband would come in different forms, sometimes as an old man
    <br>and sometimes as a young boy.
    <br>I was very attracted to him in my dreams
    <br>but physically, I was not interested in such things.
    <br>When the spiritual husband came in my dreams, I was attracted to him
    <br>and I did not have affection for my physical husband.
    <br>My husband and I have not been prospering.
    <br>This has also affected my children; they have not been prospering.
    <br>Whenever the spiritual husband came to sleep with me in my dreams,
    <br>nothing would work for me.
    <br>If others were getting good business, I would not.
    <br>Flies would come and cover what I was selling so no one wanted to buy.

    <br>Pour it! You must pour your own water!
    <br>Pour your water!
    <br>See it!
    <br>They are talking to you; you are not listening.
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Pass!
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>The water turned to fire again!
    <br>Tell us what the fire looks like.
    <br>It is tall as if they have used fuel.
    <br>It does what?
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Daddy, please, help me!
    <br>The fire is more than my power.
    <br>- I should help you?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- What do you want me to do?
    <br>- Quench it.
    <br>- I should quench it?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>OK, go.
    <br>Go now.
    <br>- You have quenched the fire?
    <br>- Go.
    <br>- I said, go!
    <br>- Are you sure?
    <br>Let me lead you.
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>You see?
    <br>Everything is free.
    <br>Wait!
    <br>DEMON Sees FIRE Surrounding CHURCH!!! ðŸ”¥â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Come!
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>No, I cannot!
    <br>You are fire too!
    <br>Do you remember that all this happened to you?
    <br>I don't remember what happened and the words I was saying.
    <br>It was the evil spirit in me that was manifesting.
    <br>When I came to my senses, I felt light and knew that I was delivered.
    <br>When I returned to the hotel, I slept in a way I have never done before.
    <br>I was light.
    <br>After the deliverance, when I slept, I did not have any dream
    <br>and didn't even know when morning came. It was so marvellous!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free.
