  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman there.
    <br>In those days, in your past, you used to wear some beads.
    <br>You have done away with these beads. You no longer wear beads but now,
    <br>the challenge you are facing now is you have no settled home.
    <br>No single man can please you.
    <br>No one can give you the kind of affection you want.
    <br>This has bastardised your career.
    <br>You are just from one place to another. But right now, you are tired.
    <br>You don't know what is wrong with you.
    <br>Please come out, Jesus loves you.
    <br>You are there, you are getting old.
    <br>And this will tell on your children. You are there.
    <br>You were wearing beads in the past.
    <br>Right now, you have stopped using them for a long time.
    <br>There is a problem you have. You have no settled home. You move from one place to another.
    <br>No one can give you what you want. Please come, come out. Jesus loves you.
    <br>You`ve put on a native. Thank you.
    <br>Prophecy time.
    <br>My name is Sylvia Ogbebor. I'm from Nigeria.
    <br>What the Man of God said, that a lady was wearing beads before.
    <br>In my school days, I was always putting on those beads.
    <br>I got married in 2012. A one year old marriage and we broke up after one year with a child.
    <br>The child is with me.
    <br>Now, I can`t stay with any man who can satisfy me. I don`t see anything good in any man.
    <br>Then I travelled from one country to another, looking for men.
    <br>I have been to Dubai like five times and Turkey doing prostitution.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>That is why I called you out.
    <br>No one can get you out of this mess. Unless the person sees the need of destroying those beads.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>It takes the grace of God to see those beads.
    <br>If ten men queue, they cannot satisfy you. It's a curse.
    <br>So you believed nobody can satisfy you in Nigeria - "let me go to Dubai" .
    <br>"Okay let me live my life and let them be enjoying me" - yet you cannot be satisfied;
    <br>it's a curse.
    <br>So, don't worry. You will give testimony. That is why I called you. It will be over.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>It is over.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>That was the message of prophecy from the anointed Man of God.
    <br>And the last word was, "it is over".
    <br>This prophecy brought about deliverance in the life of this sister.
    <br>And she is back here today, to testify to the goodness of God in her life.
    <br>The importance of prophecy in the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot be over-emphasised.
    <br>Remember all the words the Man of God said in his prophecy
    <br>are things that are very difficult for anyone to come out and talk about, to share with people.
    <br>And today, whatever you are going to hear from our sister is not meant to deride her
    <br>but to give glory to God Almighty because confession is also part of deliverance.
    <br>So right now, she wants to share her experience and also share her testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>So let us listen to her.
    <br>Sister, once again we welcome you to The SCOAN. Can you please introduce yourself
    <br>and let us hear your experience and your testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ogbebor Sylvia.
    <br>This is my mother, Mrs Veronica Ogbebor, and my son.
    <br>Last Sunday, I was here with a lot of expectation.
    <br>While I was sitting, the Man of God came very close to me and then he left.
    <br>My courage was almost gone, but when he came again, he said if you have a grudge,
    <br>against anyone, we should forgive them.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit to come to you, and then you should forgive.
    <br>Immediately, I sat down and said this prayer is not for me.
    <br>It's too painful, that I can't even forgive him.
    <br>Then, he walked down again and said, "I say you should forgive".
    <br>Then, I stood up and said, "I have forgiven him" and at that moment he mentioned my case.
    <br>He prophesied and said there is a lady who wore beads before
    <br>but has done away with them.
    <br>He said because of those beads, I could not make a home and they had spoiled my career
    <br>and that I could not stay with a man.
    <br>He said it will affect my children and that I was getting old.
    <br>These are the things that I had been sitting and thinking about alone for the past three weeks,
    <br>wondering where this problem is coming from.
    <br>When he mentioned it, I came out.
    <br>He said that my case would be settled and that I would share my testimony.
    <br>Really, what the Man of God said is true.
    <br>In those days when I was 22 years old, my neighbour called me
    <br>and said that I should follow her somewhere.
    <br>On getting to that place, there was a spiritualist who told her that they would perform
    <br>some rituals on me, like giving me a mark on my private parts and giving me beads
    <br>as an object of seduction on my waist.
    <br>All that while, it was uncontrollable.
    <br>Then I got an admission. While I was in school, I was moving from one place to another.
    <br>I went to Abuja, Port Harcourt and Ghana, doing prostitution.
    <br>At the end of the day, during my 300 level, I had an encounter with a ritualist,
    <br>which made me say, "I have to quit this before I die".
    <br>Then after my graduation in 2010, I went back to my mother's house in Lagos.
    <br>That was when I met the man that I had a baby for.
    <br>I also had a group of friends that were into prostitution too.
    <br>One of them asked me, "Why are you like this? You are no longer pretty, you are looking so unkempt".
    <br>I told them that I was not doing prostitution anymore,
    <br>that I had changed and was serving God.
    <br>They said, "This is not how to serve God. They have brainwashed you".
    <br>They said that I should take them to Abuja since I had been there before.
    <br>I should show them the way and where they should go.
    <br>I told them that I don't have money to do all of that. They then transported me down to Abuja.
    <br>We were in a hotel there. I met with an honourable in the National Assembly whom I knew before.
    <br>He gave me some money; then we came back to Lagos.
    <br>By the time we got to Lagos, they asked me what I wanted to do with the money.
    <br>I told them that I wanted to rent a house where I could stay with my mom and rent a shop for business.
    <br>They said  that I should rather travel to Turkey as they had already applied for their visas.
    <br>I agreed with them and applied for my Turkish visa.
    <br>Then, I met with my baby's farther and got pregnant for him.
    <br>Throughout the one year period that I was married to him, it was hell.
    <br>He beat me up so much, even when I was nine months pregnant.
    <br>The doctors examined me and confirmed I would deliver on a Sunday.
    <br>It was on a Friday when they confirmed the Sunday delivery.
    <br>It was on that same Friday when he beat me up.
    <br>My child almost died in the womb; I had to be rushed to the hospital
    <br>where a caesarean section was carried out on me.
    <br>After three months, he threw me out of the house.
    <br>I was serving as a National Youth Service Corps member
    <br>and my mom was in the same house with us.
    <br>He threw me and our child out, so I went back to my mom.
    <br>I was there; after the service, I went back to Abuja.
    <br>Upon getting to Abuja, I met a girl from the same group of girls who were doing prostitution.
    <br>I didn't get the job that I was going there for; she then suggested that we travel to Dubai.
    <br>I said "No", as I had not travelled before and I didn't have money for a visa.
    <br>She said that she would provide the visa for me and that I should just get a flight ticket.
    <br>That was when I started the prostitution again.
    <br>I looked for money for a ticket to go to Dubai and eventually the visa was out.
    <br>I couldn't get the money for the ticket to Dubai. She then said that she would pay for everything.
    <br>and once I got to Dubai, I would pay her back.
    <br>I agreed and we went to Dubai.
    <br>She said that when we get to Dubai, there would be a queue and within two weeks
    <br>I would be able to make the money to pay her back.
    <br>Then, I'd start making my own money to rent a house to stay in, with my mom and child.
    <br>What is the queue all about?
    <br>The queue of men that would be coming into the house where the ladies are staying.
    <br>Upon getting to Dubai,
    <br>I used to see Dubai on the TV. Dubai is a very beautiful place.
    <br>But the particular place she took me to was a market area;
    <br>African people dominated that place.
    <br>I asked her how I was going to start getting money so that I could pay her back immediately.
    <br>She said that that was where I was going to work.
    <br>She took me to a room with four beds; they were divided by curtains.
    <br>Men would come in there.
    <br>I told her that I could not do it. Then, she took my passport.
    <br>They said that I could not leave the country without a passport.
    <br>I had to start doing what she asked me to do, despite the fact that I had stiches
    <br>because after the operation, the wound re-opened; I was still going for treatment to dress the wound.
    <br>Like the Man of God said, even if 10 men queued, I would not get tired, which was true.
    <br>The men were always trooping in.
    <br>So how many men would come to you in a day?
    <br>Between 30 to 40 a day.
    <br>At that point in time, you were still nursing the wound of the operation?
    <br>Yes, I still had the wound which had not yet healed.
    <br>I came back to Nigeria and met my mom with my child in the same condition. They were looking so unkempt.
    <br>I said, "This will not continue" so I went to Abuja and Port Harcourt again to raise some money.
    <br>Then I went back to the same place.
    <br>When you went to Abuja and Port Harcourt, how did you raise money?
    <br>Through prostitution.
    <br>Then I raised money and went back to the same place in Dubai.
    <br>That was how I was able to raise money, I came back and rented a house to put my mom and child there.
    <br>All the time, I was going to and fro Lagos and Dubai.
    <br>I eventually came back in March from Dubai because the last time I went to Dubai,
    <br>whenever I saw a group of people, I could count 5-6 of them who had used and paid me.
    <br>So, all the time I was very shy and scared.
    <br>Then, I moved to the hotel where I used social networks.
    <br>I would always ask my mom to look after my child as I was going to do business.
    <br>Ok, you always told your mom that you were doing business?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So you mean your mother was not even aware that you were into prostitution?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>By the time I came back, I was sick. I had depression and too many dreams
    <br>that made me feel like I couldn't even close my eyes; if I closed my eyes, I would die.
    <br>At night, I didn't sleep and during the day time, I was always indoors.
    <br>Whenever I was indoors, I would always be busy on my phone, using socal networks to look for men.
    <br>When I came back, my son was really sick. I had to rush him to hospital.
    <br>I was asking myself how was I going to continue with this, it was too much for me.
    <br>I was depressed, I was not sleeping and that urge of sex was always there.
    <br>I wanted to sleep with men.
    <br>With the group of friends that I had, whenever I didn't see a man,
    <br>we would practice lesbianism, smoke marijuana, cigarettes and all that.
    <br>The whole thing became just too much for me
    <br>I asked myself, "My child is growing, how will I be able to continue with this?"
    <br>I told a friend what I was going through. That I couldn't sleep and so,
    <br>I asked her to prescribe drugs for me. There was a drug I used to take that always calmed my nerves.
    <br>I told her that it wasn't working. I asked her to prescribe another drug. She told me all that I needed was sex.
    <br>That was the same lesbian friend who said what I needed was sex.
    <br>That I should meet with a man to sleep with me and that would take away the anxiety.
    <br>Most of the men who gave me money, I didn't enjoy it with them.
    <br>The ones I smoked marijuana and lodged in a hotel with and at the end of the day,
    <br>I would give them money, those were the ones that I called.
    <br>This time, I needed help. So, I told my mom what I was going through. That I couldn't sleep.
    <br>My mom confided in someone who told her that there is a place where she should take me to.
    <br>We went there and the woman said that she would bathe me in the river,
    <br>I bought a lot of things and sew a white garment and we would go to the river.
    <br>The woman said I should bring N80,000 but I did not have that amount.
    <br>We then agreed on N20,000 on Friday.
    <br>On Saturday, a brother called me and said I should try and go to church on that Sunday.
    <br>I agreed and on that Sunday I came to church.
    <br>When I came on that Sunday, the Man of God gave the prophecy.
    <br>I was scared to come out but then, I thought that that was what was happening to me.
    <br>I quickly ran out.
    <br>I needed help so I cried out, "Man of God, please help me! I am depressed".
    <br>He said that I was free and I would share my testimony.
    <br>After my deliverance, I noticed that the whole trouble that was on me like a load,
    <br>I had been relieved of it.
    <br>When I got home, I decided to confirm my deliverance, by seeing if I could sleep.
    <br>When I lied on my bed, I started meditating with my Faith Bracelet.
    <br>I noticed that all of the messages the Man of God preached about, were coming back to me,
    <br>including the one the evangelist preached titled, 'No Shortcut'.
    <br>I kept thinking that all the times I had been moving around were simply shortcuts
    <br>and there are so many sins that go with shortcuts.
    <br>So that is not the right way to go.
    <br>Then I brought out my credentials, thinking they might be useful.
    <br>Then, I noticed that whenever I was meditating with my Faith Bracelet, I could sleep.
    <br>I could just sleep off only to find out later that I was still holding the bracelet in my hand.
    <br>Then I would wear it on my wrist again.
    <br>The bad dreams that I used to have are gone.
    <br>I used to have an urge for sex and could not resist it any time it came.
    <br>So, I tried to lie on my bed to see if that urge would come but it was not coming.
    <br>Rather, the messages I had heard and the books I had read were the things that I was meditating on.
    <br>So, I believe that I have been delivered. Since then I have been sleeping well.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the course of your testimony, you said that you are a university graduate, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And because of this spirit and the urge that had been tormenting you,
    <br>you forgot all about your credentials and your career.
    <br>So it was after your deliverance that you remembered your credentials?
    <br>Yes. The Man of God said it was killing my career.
    <br>Before now, if you asked me what I wanted to do or become, I would have nothing to say.
    <br>Sometimes I was scared, wondering if that was how the world was.
    <br>But later, the things which I had studied, started coming back; ideas were coming.
    <br>I carried my credentials and thought, "Wow! This is actually for me".
    <br>A lot of people I meet out there don't even have this.
    <br>"So, why would I have this and still be doing that?"
    <br>So, I felt happy within myself.
    <br>So now that you're delivered, tell us -
    <br>do you still communicate with those friends that you did this job of prostitution with?
    <br>That Tuesday, when I got home, for two days, I had kept my phone switched off.
    <br>By the time I switched it back on, messages and calls were coming in asking me where I was.
    <br>Previously, I would sit down and say, "Don't worry, we will have food; God will do wonders and miracles".
    <br>And the miracle I was expecting was for a call to come in and I would quickly go,
    <br>and make money and come back.
    <br>These calls and messages came in, asking what had happened, as they hadn't heard from me.
    <br>I deleted and blocked others - the ones I used to send nude pictures to.
    <br>These were the things I was always scared of losing before.
    <br>But I was able to delete those things from my phone.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So tell us once again, since you have been delivered last week till now,
    <br>the depression, the urge to smoke or drink - do you still have them?
    <br>No, I don't have them.
    <br>The urge to smoke was always constant before.
    <br>Whenever I would think about things like my baby's father.
    <br>The Man of God said I should forgive.
    <br>Whenever I thought of those things that put me in the condition I was in,
    <br>I wanted to smoke.
    <br>So, I would put on my dress and go to any place where I knew it was convenient for me to smoke.
    <br>But since then, I have not been smoking and that urge is no longer there.
    <br>I have noticed that I am now frequently at home. My child is around me; my children are happy.
    <br>With this mood I am in, I am very happy.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you very much. We will get back to you. In the meantime, let us listen to your mother.
    <br>We believe she also has some experiences to share.
    <br>Mama, you're welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you  please tell us your name and share with us the testimony of your daughter's deliverance.
    <br>My name is Veronica Ogbe.
    <br>And the lady beside you?
    <br>She's my last born daughter.
    <br>Kindly go ahead.
    <br>On Sunday, a call came in; she told me she wanted to go to church.
    <br>At around 5 am, she woke up, did her chores and bathed.
    <br>I asked her where she wanted to go to; she replied to church. I asked her which church.
    <br>She said The SCOAN.
    <br>I asked her who will be taking her there. She said one of her friends.
    <br>I thanked God that my child was going to church on that day.
    <br>She then went to church. We went to our own church.
    <br>When we came back, she had not returned yet.
    <br>So I decided to call her to find out if it was really church she went to or elsewhere.
    <br>When I called her, she told me that she was still in church. I thanked God.
    <br>Since God delivered her on Sunday, she has changed!
    <br>Please tell us about those changes.
    <br>She has changed because before, she would not help with anything in the house.
    <br>She would spend a lot of time on her phone.
    <br>I would ask her if she wasn't going to put her phone down and get a job so that we could eat.
    <br>Later, she would go to bed.
    <br>When she woke up, she would shower and then go out in the evening.
    <br>Since Sunday, she has been to the market, she has cleaned the house and worked.
    <br>This baby, she bathes him and washes his clothes and mine also.
    <br>She will go to the market, buy food then come home and cook. We will eat.
    <br>So she never used to do all of those things before?
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>So when she used to go out and travel to Dubai, where did she say she was going to?
    <br>Previously, she told me she was going for business. She never told me what she was really into.
    <br>That Sunday when the Man of God delivered her, I said, "God, I thank You! Man of God, I thank you!"
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>You have heard from the mother, testifying to the deliverance of the daughter.
    <br>She said she is so happy that God Almighty finally delivered her daughter.
    <br>She never knew that the daughter was into these acts of prostitution for so many years.
    <br>That each time the daughter was travelling out of the country or going out,
    <br>she would ask her where she was going and she would say that she was going for business.
    <br>According to her, she was 24/7 browsing on her phone
    <br>and she wouldn't know what she was exactly looking for,
    <br>not knowing that she was always getting contacts with men on the phone.
    <br>But ever since her daughter has been delivered, she said her attitude has changed.
    <br>Before now, she would not sweep or wash anything.
    <br>She would not even take care of the baby or even take care of the home.
    <br>But now she has started doing all of those things. Her countenance has changed.
    <br>She is now happy. She doesn't go out anymore.
    <br>She stays indoors except when she is coming to church.
    <br>And she said "To God be the glory!"
    <br>Once again let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>First, I have something to say about Jesus who delivered me.
    <br>Jesus is faithful and always ready to accept you, no matter the kind of sins you have committed.
    <br>He is always there to tell you, "I love you".
    <br>To everyone listening to my testimony out there, I will tell them that if you are believing God
    <br>for one thing or another, you should always have faith.
    <br>believing that some day, God will answer your prayer.
    <br>And to other people I had met out there.
    <br>There are a lot of ladies I have met out there; some have two children, others have three
    <br>and they always have one excuse or the other for what lured them into doing what they are doing.
    <br>I want to tell you that that way is a shortcut and there is always sin that goes along with that way.
    <br>Since you are graduating from one level to another, because that was how I was graduating,
    <br>I want to tell you that the way which is very easy, step-by-step,
    <br>is where you find meekness, happiness and peace of mind.
    <br>I want to tell you that Jesus loves you; come back home.
    <br>Come back home. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Yes, come back home. Because the Bible says homelessness is man's condition without Christ.
    <br>And homelessness is a life that is devoid of Christ.
    <br>When Christ is not in our lives, we are homeless.
    <br>So come back home, those who are still in the wilderness of prostitution,
    <br>and all other crimes and vices that do not please God.
    <br>To God be the glory. Now that God Almighty has set you free, we also want to encourage you
    <br>to follow the way that you have discovered, the new life that you have found
    <br>and the love of Jesus that He has shown you.
    <br>Walk in the way of Christ by making His word the standard for your life.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make His word the standard for your life
    <br>and the deliverance you have received will be permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again let us clap for Jesus Christ!
