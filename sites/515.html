    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>A hindrance to prayer is when our spirit is not free.
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>When your spirit is free, it becomes sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>What is the cause of our spirit being in a state of dullness, worry, anxiety?
    <br>Even when you are in the presence of God, you are worried.
    <br>It is due to the activity of the devil's nature.
    <br>You know the nature of devil.
    <br>When your spirit is free, it becomes sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>When opposite is the case, our spirit becomes useless as an instrument.
    <br>Do you want a free spirit?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Do you want a free spirit?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Keep your heart from cares.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Keep your heart from cares."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by 'cares'?
    <br>Worry, anxiety, distress, pressure.
    <br>When your spirit is free, it becomes sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>And you want a free spirit.
    <br>Keep your heart from cares, worry, trouble, anxiety, concern.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Yes, I want to be like Jesus.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Christianity lies in the heart.]
    <br>Hebrew 4:3:
    <br>"Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said,
    <br>'So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest'.'
    <br>And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world."
    <br>Those who believe enter into the rest.
    <br>Faith and rest cannot be separated from one another.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>We are talking about hindrance to prayer.
    <br>When one is in a state of dullness, trouble,
    <br>which is caused by devil's nature...
    <br>You can think of the cause of your worry, anxiety,
    <br>"Am I really in a 'true' place?
    <br>Am I really in a 'true' position?
    <br>I don't know the power I'm under.
    <br>A lot of things have been going up and down.
    <br>I have been to many places. Where am I? What is wrong?"
    <br>Prayer is as much cooperation with God.
    <br>You and God are cooperating -
    <br>to lift the load together,
    <br>work together, talk together, sit together, etc.
    <br>When you pray through the name, He gives instruction.
    <br>There is a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>There is a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There are names called 'Jesus' but there is a name in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Other names, 'Jesus' - are just names;
    <br>Jesus of Nazareth - power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>If you don't call that name in the power of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>you are calling the name of your brother somewhere.
    <br>That name can only be called when your spirit is free.
    <br>When your spirit is free, then, you can cooperate.
    <br>You cannot cooperate with Him when your spirit is not free.
    <br>He is a jealous God, He can do it alone.
    <br>Our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>Is your spirit free?
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>You pray over some matter and yet afterwards,
    <br>you find yourself still worrying over it,
    <br>still full of anxious concerns,
    <br>just as if you have never prayed at all.
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because your spirit is not free.
    <br>When your spirit is not free, it can never be sensitive to the Spirit of God,
    <br>it can never feel the Spirit of God, attract the Spirit of God,
    <br>it can never be conscious of the Spirit of God.
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>"I feel pain."
    <br>If your leg is not dead, when you hit your leg, you will feel a sharp pain.
    <br>When your spirit is not free, you cannot feel the Spirit of God
    <br>or be conscious of that Spirit of God.
    <br>- Sensitive?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Because you are worried, anxious, troubled.
    <br>Imagine - you are thinking whether God can do it.
    <br>You believe you have been in His presence in the past;
    <br>you are comparing your former meeting with God with the meeting you have now.
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>That is a form of unbelief,
    <br>and you say you are a believer,
    <br>but you act...
    <br>That is a form of unbelief.
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>A failure to act faith nullifies our prayer.
    <br>Cancels.
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>To act faith is now, not next because faith is in the present.
    <br>It believes, acts, confesses and receives now.
    <br>Not after that prayer...
    <br>You say, "I don't believe" but you suddenly see another miracle happening there;
    <br>"That one is greater than my own - I should believe now!
    <br>This man prayed for me to be healed of headache",
    <br>but after the prayer you say, "This thing does not work for me".
    <br>You now sit and begin to watch the other people.
    <br>You suddenly saw a man on a wheelchair who started walking.
    <br>You say, "A wheelchair compared to my headache - I should believe my miracle!
    <br>I believe, I'm healed now because I have seen the greater one.
    <br>Now I'm healed. Headache - you have to go."
    <br>No!
    <br>Faith is in the present tense.
    <br>It believes, receives, acts and confesses now.
    <br>A failure to act faith nullifies your prayer.
    <br>Our prayer for any matter should be followed by an attitude
    <br>of absolute trust in God that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>Somebody is fighting hell for you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Somebody is fighting hell for me today!"
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>Somebody is somewhere fighting hell for you today!
    <br>Somebody will defeat fear for you today!
    <br>Somebody in the person of the Holy Spirit will defeat fear for you today,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fear of failure will be defeated today!
    <br>Fear of accusation will be defeated today!
    <br>Fear of sickness and disease will be defeated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I want to hear your voice!
    <br>Rise up!
    <br>Make a crazy noise!
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Faith demands that we truly rest.
    <br>That is what faith demands.
    <br>We have Christian faith and we have religious faith.
    <br>Christian faith demands that we truly rest -
    <br>in which the heart is free from worry, anxiety, distress
    <br>and the body is free from labour.
    <br>But what kind of faith do you have today?
    <br>Religious faith.
    <br>The world today is exercising religious faith and they say they are Christians.
    <br>Many who are religious think they are Christians.
    <br>You say you are a Christian and you believe God will do it for you.
    <br>Why are you troubled, anxious?
    <br>Is it because you are afraid that He will not do it well?
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>Christian faith demands that we truly rest -
    <br>in which the heart is free from worry and anxiety and the body is free from labour.
    <br>That is Christian faith.
    <br>You can now know that you were a religious person in the past - not a Christian.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me hear your voice.
    <br>What HINDERS Our PRAYERS | TB Joshua
    <br>That you go to this or that place does not make you a Christian -
    <br>it is the kind of faith you have.
    <br>I believe that many of you were religious people before, not Christians.
    <br>For your heart to be free from worry,
    <br>for your body to be free from labour,
    <br>you must have faith in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ, not faith in yourself.
    <br>Before now, you had faith in yourself.
    <br>God gives us faith - it is a portion of gift from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>In summary:
    <br>HINDRANCE TO PRAYER
    <br>That is the title of the message.
    <br>One of the greatest hindrances to prayer is a state of dullness.
    <br>You worry, "Will I be healed? Will I be delivered? Will my debt be paid?"
    <br>You worry,
    <br>"Will I be healed of my sickness? Will my cousin, sister be healed?"
    <br>You worry, "How will I pay my house rent?"
    <br>Until your heart is free from worry, you can't be sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Until your heart is free from worry..."
    <br>"Will my debt be paid? Will my business move? Will I be healed? How will I go about this?
    <br>How will I get out of this problem?"
    <br>All this we don't carry to the presence of God.
    <br>If God is the One doing it for you, why are we afraid? Why are we worried?
    <br>Is it because we are afraid He will not be able to do it well
    <br>or He will not be able to do it alone?
    <br>Then we are not cooperating with Him.
    <br>That nullifies our cooperation.
    <br>Prayer for any matter should be followed by an attitude
    <br>of absolute trust in God that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Keep your heart from cares".
    <br>Once again.
    <br>[Keep your heart from cares.]
    <br>Keep your heart from cares if you want a free spirit.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>[Keep your heart from cares if you want a free spirit.]
    <br>Only a free spirit can attract, can feel the Spirit of God.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Thank you.
