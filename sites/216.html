  <p>    
    <br>Wise Man Daniel walks in the Spirit in Christ Jesus,
    <br>ministering Spirit-filled prayer in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Instantly, Jesus Christ is brought to the scene
    <br>and the spiritual entities that are causing crisis in the lives of the people are exposed
    <br>by the lightening from Heaven.
    <br>As Wise Man Daniel continued pouring light all over the congregants,
    <br>he encounters this young man who immediately falls under the power of deliverance
    <br>and the spiritual entity possessing his body is put in a very hot furnace.
    <br>The evil spirit refuses to confess.
    <br>So Wise Man Daniel continues to turn the heat up,
    <br>commanding Holy Ghost fire to descend upon him
    <br>and the unclean spirit is forced to talk.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am not going to tell you.
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>Why do you want to know?
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>I have destroyed him. I gave him the spirit of lust.
    <br>I gave him destruction.
    <br>I'm going to ruin him until I kill him.
    <br>What is your mission?
    <br>To destroy him.
    <br>In what way?
    <br>I will make him lose concentration in anything he does.
    <br>What else have you done?
    <br>I gave him the spirit of lust.
    <br>What else?
    <br>I will make him bring more people for me.
    <br>What caliber of people do you want him to bring to you?
    <br>Youth.
    <br>What have you done to the youth?
    <br>I will destroy them.
    <br>How do you destroy them? Speak!
    <br>I destroy their future.
    <br>In what way?
    <br>I will make them lose concentration,
    <br>I will destroy them,
    <br>give them the spirit of lust.
    <br>How do you get these youth?
    <br>School area, everywhere.
    <br>When you go to school, how do you get the youth? Explain.
    <br>I will make friends with them and whatever I give them, that's all.
    <br>What do you normally give them?
    <br>I give them money,
    <br>I give them food
    <br>When you give them those things, what will happen to them?
    <br>They come with me.
    <br>Do you say anything before giving to them, or how do they follow you?
    <br>I just give to them.
    <br>And when they sleep, they come to me in my room.
    <br>Yes, I possess them.
    <br>How many youth have you succeeded in possessing?
    <br>Many!
    <br>How many?
    <br>Many, I can't count.
    <br>Is it boys and girls or boys alone?
    <br>Both boys and girls.
    <br>How do you get girls?
    <br>I sleep with them. I possess them.
    <br>In the night they become mine.
    <br>They become yours?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When they become yours, what will then happen to them and their family?
    <br>When I possess them, they destroy their family members.
    <br>They act as a tool for me and my kingdom.
    <br>They posses everyone -
    <br>their siblings, brothers, sisters, everybody they know.
    <br>Is it secondary school you go to or university?
    <br>Secondary schools and primary schools.
    <br>You have initiated many?
    <br>Yes, but most especially in secondary schools.
    <br>How many, can you just give a number of how many you have initiated?
    <br>I have lost count, there are so many.
    <br>They are so many?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did you enter his body?
    <br>He caught my fish; my golden fish.
    <br>How did he catch the fish?
    <br>He was passing and he saw some people catching fish.
    <br>He joined them and unfortunately he took my precious fish.
    <br>Did he eat the fish?
    <br>No, he took it home.
    <br>What happened when he took it home?
    <br>He wanted to use the fish,
    <br>but a spirit asked him to take the fish away.
    <br>I heard them saying that.
    <br>But before they came for the fish, I entered him.
    <br>The fish was no more.
    <br>They looked for the fish but they could not find it
    <br>because I had already entered him.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am the king of kings.
    <br>Of the evil kingdom?
    <br>Yes, I posses all the youth.
    <br>You possess all the youths?
    <br>Yes, that is my specialty.
    <br>That is your specialty?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>On this earth?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, you said that he caught your golden fish; your precious fish.
    <br>Does it mean you live inside the water?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What is your position in the water?
    <br>I am the king.
    <br>You are the king?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How do you operate in the water?
    <br>I send my fish out and if you get them,
    <br>if you eat them, you become a tool.
    <br>I would use you as I want.
    <br>Do you stay in the ocean or a river?
    <br>All the streams.
    <br>You are everywhere?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What have you done to his family?
    <br>I have destroyed all his family members.
    <br>In what way?  How have you destroyed them?
    <br>No one goes beyond secondary school level.
    <br>What level has he attended?
    <br>He just finished his SSCE.
    <br>No one goes beyond secondary school level in his family?
    <br>Yes, in all his extended family, no one succeeds.
    <br>No one!  Not even one!
    <br>Not even one?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Why did you allow him to come here?
    <br>He has been watching Emmanuel TV and he was arrested.
    <br>As much as I tried to stop him, I couldn't.
    <br>He was arrested through Emmanuel TV?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Were you sleeping when he came here today?
    <br>No.
    <br>Where were you?
    <br>I was in him, but I couldn't stop him
    <br>because the pressure to come here was too much.
    <br>He had the zeal to come here, I couldn't stop him.
    <br>Fire all over your body!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>All over your body!
    <br>From your head to your toe!
    <br>All over!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Let me practice and I will deal with you!
    <br>Okay, practice.
    <br>I will deal with you!
    <br>A demonic king, from the evil kingdom based in the water
    <br>has completely manifested itself through the boy
    <br>and is now provoked to challenge the wise man.
    <br>He asked the wise man for some time to practise his moves
    <br>and begins dancing and skipping, using the faculties of the boy to warm up
    <br>in preparation to physically attack the wise man.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Let's go!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Fire all over your body!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Do you want to practise?
    <br>Okay, practise.
    <br>Last bus stop!
    <br>Wise Man Daniel gives the boy more time to practise
    <br>and the boy continues practising and warming up once again for a second round.
    <br>Are you okay now?
    <br>Let's go again.
    <br>Okay, come closer - the gap is too much, come closer.
    <br>I will deal with you.
    <br>Fire!
    <br>All over your body!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Do you want to practise more?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Okay, practise.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Two rounds have passed with Wise Man Daniel clearly having the upper hand
    <br>and the demonic king continues using the faculties of the boy to do more extensive training.
    <br>A few more arm pushouts in different directions is the new power exercise.
    <br>Are you okay now?
    <br>Okay.
    <br>If you have power, pass this line.
    <br>Draw it. Draw it very well.
    <br>He draws out the battlefield line between him and the wise man,
    <br>stretching his right leg way out and sketching it on the ground.
    <br>He then stamps it with his hand before giving it the final touch.
    <br>Pass this line.
    <br>I should pass that line?
    <br>Pass the line.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Oh God, if you come near me!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>You are still coming?
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Fire all over your body!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The battle is over with a fiery knockout blow.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You are delivered. Rise up.
    <br>Set free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come here.
    <br>Set free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Who is the owner of this pair of shoes?
    <br>These are my shoes.
    <br>How come they are off from your feet?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>But you were putting them on before?
    <br>Yes, and I was standing over there.
    <br>Now, how come they are here?
    <br>Did you remove my shoes?
    <br>It's not me.
    <br>You don't know who removed them?
    <br>No.
    <br>You said you are the king of kings?
    <br>Which kingdom?
    <br>You are asking me which kingdom?
    <br>Because I don't know, I am not a king.
    <br>You said you are the king of kings from the evil kingdom.
    <br>I'm not even a king how could I be king of kings?
    <br>From the evil kingdom.
    <br>No.
    <br>You said you go about possessing the youth all over the world.
    <br>No.
    <br>You specialise in possessing the youth in the secondary schools.
    <br>No, I didn't say so.
    <br>You initiate them through food, biscuits, items.
    <br>You give items to them, they meet you through dreams in your kingdom.
    <br>No.
    <br>You said you have initiated thousands of youth.
    <br>I have many friends, but I don't initiate people.
    <br>You wanted to fight me here.
    <br>Me? How can I fight you?
    <br>You don't know you wanted to fight me?
    <br>No, where is the power?
    <br>Fight you like this? I did not fight you.
    <br>How come you are sweating like this?
    <br>I don't know. Is the A/C not on?
    <br>I saw you, you were taking water and pouring it on your body.
    <br>What was happening to you that time?
    <br>You took it three times and were pouring it on your body - three consecutive times.
    <br>What was happening to you?
    <br>Actually, when I came here, after some time, I started feeling heat on me.
    <br>I was no longer comfortable.
    <br>But I never knew I poured water on myself.
    <br>You poured water on youself three times.
    <br>What was happening to you when you were pouring this water on yourself?
    <br>I was hot. There was fire all over my body.
    <br>Were you able to quench it with this water?
    <br>I felt fire. But I didn't know that I took water from anywhere but I felt fire.
    <br>You didn't know you used this water on your body?
    <br>No.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I'm delivered! Thank You, Jesus
