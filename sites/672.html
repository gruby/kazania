    <br>This was the condition of Pastor Frederick when he came to The SCOAN.
    <br>He came all the way from Kenya to The SCOAN unable to walk.
    <br>You can see the expression of pain on his face as he positions himself to crawl forward.
    <br>Falling on his hands and knees, this is the only way Pastor Frederick could move by himself
    <br>when he arrived at The SCOAN.
    <br>The simple act of moving from one room to another, something that was once so easy for him to do
    <br>has become a tedious and very painful task.
    <br>Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"
    <br>You can see by the tense expression and sweat on his face just how difficult it is for him
    <br>to move from place to place without the assistance of another person.
    <br>Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"
    <br>He gradually makes his way towards the bed and with another gasp of pain and exertion
    <br>he awkwardly heaves himself up, onto the bed.
    <br>What could have made the pastor of a large ministry,
    <br>who just a week ago was energetically preaching at his pulpit now crawl on his hands and knees?
    <br>Let's hear from him.
    <br>I come from Nairobi, Kenya.
    <br>My name is Pastor Frederick.
    <br>I am a pastor and I used to pray for people.
    <br>Now I feel pain.
    <br>I can't walk.
    <br>I prayed and nothing has happened.
    <br>The name of our ministry is Word and Repentance Ministries, Nairobi, Kenya.
    <br>The reason why I came here â€“ after preaching on Sunday, I had an attack in our church.
    <br>I had some pain in my left ankle.
    <br>I came by chance.
    <br>For now, I can't walk.
    <br>People have been helping me, to carry me but I don't want to bother them now.
    <br>I can't walk without any help.
    <br>Now I'm crawling like a baby.
    <br>From the toilet, I can't go alone.
    <br>I have to crawl like a baby.
    <br>You saw me a few minutes ago.
    <br>I could not walk alone.
    <br>I was just crawling because I don't want to bother people again to carry me.
    <br>Now I can't walk.
    <br>I feel pain.
    <br>Right now, I'm sitting down.
    <br>I want the man of God to pray for me so that I can walk.
    <br>This right ankle is painful.
    <br>You can see it's a bit swollen here.
    <br>Even now, it has come to my knee.
    <br>My knee is swollen. I can't fold it.
    <br>It is swollen.
    <br>Right now I can't walk.
    <br>I can't do anything.
    <br>I can't preach.
    <br>I'm sitting down, I'm just sleeping.
    <br>I can't do anything. I can't walk.
    <br>I'm just sleeping the whole day.
    <br>I feel a headache now.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for bringing you here to The SCOAN.
    <br>We believe with you that God Almighty will use the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to put an end
    <br>to these problems in your life today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>WORD AND REPENTANCE CHURCH, Nairobi, Kenya, by Pastor Fredrick Okuku
    <br>What you are watching is a footage from Pastor Frederick's church - the Word and Repentance Ministry,
    <br>in Nairobi, Kenya.
    <br>This is the Word and Repentance Ministry in Nairobi.
    <br>You are watching clips from their recording of what took place during some of their Sunday services,
    <br>led by Pastor Frederick Okuku.
    <br>Pastor Frederick regards his ministry as a deliverance ministry.
    <br>You can see how he conducts himself among the congregation
    <br>and how he interacts with different people, with different problems.
    <br>Notice how he uses physical strength, pushing, pulling, and holding the different individuals,
    <br>in an attempt to deliver them.
    <br>But the Bible says, "It is not by power or by might but by My Spirit, says the Lord".
    <br>Healing, deliverance, blessing and salvation are not brought to pass by anything done by man.
    <br>What we receive of Jesus Christ is not a mere product of any man's natural ability or power.
    <br>While man has the ability to preach, to speak and to touch on the outside, it is the Holy Spirit who heals,
    <br>saves, blesses and delivers as He wills.
    <br>Therefore, ministers of God must be under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit at all times.
    <br>Where God guides He provides.
    <br>Where God leads, His solution, provision and protection be.
    <br>This was how the services at the Word and Repentance Ministry had been going on for some time.
    <br>But one day, Pastor Frederick met with a stiff opposition.
    <br>During the service a woman possessing 7 evil spirits came forward.
    <br>But this was not the end of the encounter.
    <br>Events which may seem ordinary can have extraordinary effects in the spirit,
    <br>much of which are hidden to the ordinary eye.
    <br>After the demons had warned Pastor Frederick to leave them alone,
    <br>when he persisted, they threatened to destroy him.
    <br>Not unlike the 7 sons of Sceva, when asked by Pastor Frederick, "Do you know me?",
    <br>the demons repeatedly replied, "No".
    <br>Demons can recognize imposters and can distinguish them from those with real spiritual power.
    <br>This is a reminder that demons are real, and Christianity is not to be practised as a hobby,
    <br>for there is danger in it.
    <br>Let's watch the encounter between Pastor Frederick and the demon-possessed woman.
    <br>Come out you sickness.
    <br>Contrary spirit, I command you, come out.
    <br>Every sickness, I command you, come out.
    <br>Look at my eyes, look there, look here.
    <br>Stop looking sideways.
    <br>Look at me.
    <br>You are going?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Manifestation. What is making her to talk?
    <br>Who can answer me?
    <br>We are seven.
    <br>You are seven?
    <br>Yes, we are seven.
    <br>I'm telling you, we are seven.
    <br>What is she saying?
    <br>How many are you here?
    <br>We are seven.
    <br>You are not listening.
    <br>You! Don't disturb me!
    <br>You want to "pick" me?
    <br>Come!
    <br>OK, I'm coming.
    <br>No!
    <br>WORD AND REPENTANCE CHURCH - NAIROBI, KENYA
    <br>Do you know me?
    <br>No, no, no, no.
    <br>Do you know me?
    <br>Open your eyes.
    <br>Do you know me?
    <br>Open your eyes.
    <br>No.
    <br>If you are powerful, open your eyes.
    <br>No.
    <br>She has refused to open her eyes.
    <br>No.
    <br>Leave me alone.
    <br>WORD AND REPENTANCE CHURCH - NAIROBI, KENYA
    <br>... destroy...
    <br>We will destroy you.
    <br>WORD AND REPENTANCE CHURCH - NAIROBI, KENYA
    <br>You are the one who has been killing people.
    <br>Those who have been delivering you have been dying.
    <br>Do you want to kill me?
    <br>Come and kill me.
    <br>Deliverance Time
    <br>Kill me too.
    <br>Are you not the ones who kill pastors?
    <br>Those who tried to deliver you, you killed them.
    <br>Deliverance Time
    <br>Raise up your handkerchiefs to impact it with fire.
    <br>That night after the service, he was attacked by the evil spirits
    <br>and found himself unable to walk the next morning.
    <br>For the first time it dawned on Pastor Frederick that he was on a dangerous mission.
    <br>Immediately, Pastor Frederick set about making his way to The SCOAN
    <br>in Lagos, Nigeria, in search of a solution.
    <br>On Sunday, Pastor Frederick was assisted to the prayer line to receive prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He calls out for help.
    <br>You are now watching footage of how Pastor Frederick was aided by two men
    <br>to get to the prayer line that Sunday morning.
    <br>Not my brother but it's me, oh Lord, 'cos I'm standing in the need of prayer.
    <br>It's me...
    <br>They have come to God's presence today, to the arena of liberty to be set free.
    <br>Man of God, help me. I want to walk.
    <br>I cannot walk.
    <br>There were some agents who came to the church and said they had come to attack me.
    <br>They said they were coming to attack you in the church?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They said they will attack me.
    <br>And they attacked you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let us see how you walk.
    <br>This is a pastor from Kenya.
    <br>This is how I was going to the toilet.
    <br>It was hard for me.
    <br>Father, let Your name be glorified.
    <br>Come on, look here.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Just stand up.
    <br>This was the man who could not rise to his feet without someone supporting him.
    <br>About 3 to 4 people brought him here today all the way from Kenya.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>OK, come.
    <br>This is a pastor from Kenya.
    <br>Deliverance Time
    <br>Watch your screen and see what is happening.
    <br>Total deliverance from that severe evil attack.
    <br>Right now the man of God said, "Walk, in the name of Jesus Christ".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can now walk.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am free. I will preach now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Can we see how he was carried here today?
    <br>Very soon we are going to watch his condition before now.
    <br>Can you come here now? Come to the seat now.
    <br>Let's watch the video.
    <br>Right now you can see the man walking by himself without any support.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>I am healed. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Man of God, I sold the church keyboard for me to come here.
    <br>People were contributing money.
    <br>You sold the keyboard of the church to buy the ticket?
    <br>To buy the ticket because they were even fighting financially.
    <br>Here is the keyboard from Pastor Frederick's church, which he sold in order to purchase the ticket
    <br>to come to The SCOAN in Lagos.
    <br>These are the members of his congregation, who also contributed funds towards his flight ticket, so that
    <br>he could come for deliverance, having been spiritually attacked after one of his Sunday services.
    <br>They fought you financially?
    <br>I help people.
    <br>No, no, no, no. They are not fighting you.
    <br>I think your anointing is questionable.
    <br>I don't want you to say anything against the anointing of God.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>OK. You begin to tell me that because you help people
    <br>- that is why they attacked you, you were attacked financially, health-wise.
    <br>Who are you? Am I not helping people?
    <br>Your calling is questionable.
    <br>Now, we have to sit down and ask God, Lord Jesus for His mercy and His favour.
    <br>You have a passion for His Word, and I know this is your desire now.
    <br>We will pray together. OK?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What you are saying now is blasphemy.
    <br>Forgive me, sir.
    <br>Ask God to forgive you.
    <br>Don't ever say that because you help people, you were attacked.
    <br>Where is Jesus then?
    <br>Is it your power?
    <br>No.
    <br>If you are attacked, they attack Jesus.
    <br>If they beat you, they beat Jesus -  if you are really from Jesus.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"
    <br>I am not saying you don't have a calling but there is something wrong somewhere.
    <br>So, don't complain again that you help people and that's why they attacked you.
    <br>It is blasphemy.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>OK.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>We are not doing this for any reason but as a lesson for me, number one, and a lesson for you, number two.
    <br>Seven sons of Sceva - like I have told you...
    <br>This use of the name Jesus inspired them to try using the same name as an incantation.
    <br>When they were saying, 'In the name of Jesus, God of Paul, whom Paul called'
    <br>and satan said to them, 'We know Jesus, we know God of Paul, who are you?'
    <br>This is exactly what happened here.
    <br>You may be doing it for 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 years,
    <br>but when the repercussion comes, it will be so great that people can see that
    <br>'Look, with what you are doing in the name of Jesus - why this?'
    <br>After that, we'll now pray for our pastor and tell the pastor here, his calling.
    <br>He should not go beyond his calling.
    <br>Preach the Gospel, sing wonderful songs God has given you.
    <br>When it is time to pray, offer the prayer and leave them for their faith.
    <br>Don't call anybody and begin to perform one-on-one prayer - it is dangerous if you don't have that calling.
    <br>When it is time for deliverance, pray and call the power of God to descend on those contrary spirits.
    <br>It will happen.
    <br>Not going into their midst - it is a different anointing.
    <br>It is great going into their midst and to begin to have a personal encounter with these people.
    <br>It is the most dangerous thing.
    <br>When you have the anointing to provoke them, you can go and provoke them.
    <br>When it comes to responsibility from God, the more your faithfulness, the more your responsibility.
    <br>If your faithfulness is reducing, your responsibility will also reduce.
    <br>My pastor - this is what I want you to know.
    <br>We will pray with you, the congregation will pray with you.
    <br>We will pray for your ministry.
    <br>Your ministry will remain.
    <br>Nothing will happen to your ministry.
    <br>What happened to you is to strengthen your desire.
    <br>It's not meant to destroy your ministry.
    <br>This is the time to be closer to God so that you can hear God louder.
    <br>Before now, you heard God loud but not louder.
    <br>When you get back to Kenya, start trusting in God's authority, not majority.
    <br>The problem you people have is that you trust majority.
    <br>Be closer to God, go to the mountain, have a place to pray.
    <br>Your life must be full of prayer.
    <br>Have more devotion, more commitment, more prayer.
    <br>The first place where we have to prosper in the Church is our spiritual life.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Pastor Frederick Okuku.
    <br>I am from Kenya.
    <br>I really love the man of God ever since I saw his tape and I started watching him on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was inspired by his ministry and I really liked what he was doing.
    <br>I couldn't walk.
    <br>What happened was that after prayer, I felt a pain on my left ankle.
    <br>They decided to take me to the airport.
    <br>I arrived here, I could not walk. I was taken to the room.
    <br>It was difficult for me to walk but after the  prayer - it was like a twinkle of an eye - I received my healing.
    <br>And not only that.
    <br>After the prayer, my wife called me from Kenya and told me that one of my sons could not go to the toilet,
    <br>could not pass urine, that I must help her with prayer.
    <br>I said I would not hide it from the man of God. I would tell him straight away.
    <br>She then said, "Okay".
    <br>He stretched his hand and told me to go and call her back.
    <br>Immediately, when I called her back, my wife told me that the boy was OK; he has passed urine.
    <br>After the prayer, I got healed; I'm OK.
    <br>Now, I can do anything.
    <br>Can you do those things you couldn't do before?
    <br>Hallelujah. Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus!
    <br>I want to warn men of God not to imitate because what they don't know, they speak about it
    <br>and what they know, they destroy.
    <br>This one cannot be destroyed.
    <br>That's why I came here.
    <br>I thank God for everything because my past is over.
    <br>Wait for God's time because God's time is the best time.
    <br>Stop imitating any man of God.
    <br>If God has called you, just do it the way He has called you.
    <br>God will not "certify" your calling and leave you.
    <br>He will fight until the end.
    <br>I'm also a gospel singer and I would like to sing for the Lord for what He has done for me.
    <br>I have a Father
    <br>that would never ever fail me
    <br>I have a Father

    <br>He would never ever fail me
    <br>Rock of ages never ever fail
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Let us pray for our evangelist.
    <br>Before the prayer, like I have said - a lesson to everyone of us.
    <br>Donâ€™t say, "Amen" because somebody says, "In the name of Jesus".
    <br>Say "Amen" because you believe.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't say 'Amen' because the pastor says, 'In the name of Jesus'.
    <br>Say 'Amen' because you believe.
    <br>Don't say 'Amen' because T.B. Joshua says, 'In the name of Jesus'.
    <br>Say 'Amen' because you believe".
    <br>Clip "Do NOT Try This At Home!!!"
    <br>Stretch your hand and pray for the church, pray for the evangelist.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Evangelist, stand up.
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
