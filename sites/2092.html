    <br>This is a very good restaurant. Maybe we should try it. What do you say?
    <br>Yes madam.
    <br>There are some journalists around.
    <br>Don't bother. Nobody knows her.

    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Oh!
    <br>This is big news! We are on top of it.
    <br>His face looks familiar.
    <br>- No madam. We've never seen him.
    <br>- Are you sure?
    <br>That's James! Wow!
    <br>Who is James?
    <br>It's him - the man that used to hang around outside my supermarket, asking for help.
    <br>But I've not seen him for some time. He's the one! Wow!
    <br>- I don't remember.
    <br>- James!
    <br>James, madam! The man that tried to sell you water outside the supermarket, madam. The water seller, madam.
    <br>I don't remember.
    <br>The water seller, madam. He tried to sell you water and then he came and asked me for help to get him a job.
    <br>- Oh yes, I remember now. His name is James?
    <br>- Yes, madam.
    <br>So he became this successful?

    <br>No pictures. No interview. No comment.
    <br>It is very important that we interview him.
    <br>- We have many questions.
    <br>- Alright.
    <br>Man Of The Year, thank you very much. Please tell us how did you make it?
    <br>Hmmm.
    <br>But sorry sir, how did you reach this level in such a short time?
    <br>Well.
    <br>Man Of The Year, can you tell us a bit about your background and what is the secret of your success?
    <br>What can I say? It may amaze you to know that there are some genuinely good people out there
    <br>always willing to help others and I am one of the beneficiaries of such people.

    <br>It's nice to see you again, my brother. Thank you.

    <br>This is embarrassing.
    <br>You could have at least made me buy that bottled water at that time.
    <br>Would it have made any difference, madam?
    <br>Yes, because I didn't do anything wrong to him or bad to him, like you did, as you told me.
    <br>I'm sorry madam, but you always treat people as if they are nothing; as if they are beneath you, madam.
    <br>You've always enjoyed it, madam, and you still do, madam.
    <br>I'm sorry, madam, but you behave like a spoilt little girl, madam.
    <br>You! You are just ugly!
    <br>Spoilt little girl, me?
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>When we see what we really are,
    <br>it's so hard to believe.
    <br>God's Word is a mirror showing us who we really are.
    <br>So if you were to see yourself through that mirror
    <br>what would you see?
    <br>You know, the real thing about you is your spirit.
    <br>Let us listen to TB Joshua advise us on how to take care of our spiritual life in this message titled:
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. Joshua
    <br>The real thing about man is not his body, but his spirit.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23,
    <br>we are told that man is a divine being,
    <br>spirit being.
    <br>The real thing about man is not his body, but his spirit.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing about me is not my body.
    <br>Because when you wake up in the morning, you do make-up, you do your hair, you look in the mirror -
    <br>you have forgotten the real thing, you have forgotten to dress the real thing,
    <br>you have forgotten to do make-up for the real thing, you have forgotten to put on more hair - wig - for the real thing.
    <br>But you have forgotten the real thing.
    <br>Whom are we supposed to take care of first?
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing should be the first priority.
    <br>You are supposed to take care of the real thing -
    <br>bath the real thing, make-up for the real thing, take care of the real thing.
    <br>Because today, what are you taking care of?
    <br>Tell me how many times have you looked in the mirror and seen the real thing and know how it looks?
    <br>Some of us we look good, beautiful, handsome, but if you look at your real thing, this is the way you look.
    <br>Can you see? You are not taking care of it.
    <br>Some of our real things [look like this] and you look beautiful.
    <br>Sometimes when I see people moving around, and they have put on a tie,
    <br>when I now look at him to know the real thing in him, the real thing looks [like this].
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You will be very embarrassed when you see your real thing.
    <br>Can you see the life we are living?
    <br>You will be very embarrassed when God shows you your real thing.
    <br>Some of the real things look like this.
    <br>But you, you look beautiful, handsome.
    <br>You put make-up on in the morning, you wake up, you take care of yourself, you clean your teeth.
    <br>You say, "Ok, can you get me salad?".
    <br>Have you fed your real thing?
    <br>"Salad. Do you have salad here? No, I need salad".
    <br>And the real thing is suffering.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing about me is not my body
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>The real thing about you is not your body, but your spirit.
    <br>You cannot get involved in God's projects without your real self.
    <br>Man is a spirit being; you are a spirit being.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Lift your hands and worship
    <br>and say, "Lord, if I find favour in Your sight, let it be unto me according to Your will. Your good and perfect will".
    <br>Come on. Continue to talk to Jesus.
    <br>Lord if I find favour in Your sight
    <br>Lord please hear my heart cry
    <br>I'm desperately waiting to be where You are
    <br>I'll cross the hottest desert
    <br>I'll travel near or far

    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Viewers, we salute your faith.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>I know today, the Spirit of God will talk to you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's quickly go to the book of John 14. I will take my proof text from this passage.
    <br>The rest of the books will be given to you.
    <br>John 14:1(NIV) - "Do not let your hearts be troubled ..."
    <br>I told you about the word 'heart'. It is your spirit they refer to.
    <br>Wherever you see the word 'heart', it means your spirit, biblically.
    <br>It refers to your spirit - man's spirit.
    <br>"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God ..."
    <br>Without heart, you can't have anything to do with God - without spirit.
    <br>Because He uses our spirit to get to us.
    <br>The Spirit of God uses our spirit to talk to us.
    <br>This is why you see 'heart'.
    <br>He says, "Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God ..." - through your heart,
    <br>"Believe also in Me. My Father's house has many mansions..."
    <br>'Many mansions' - think about that.
    <br>"If that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?".
    <br>It means, there are so many mansions; there are big mansions.
    <br>That is why He is going there to prepare a place for you. There will be accommodation for you.
    <br>Let's go to verse 26, which is the proof text.
    <br>John 14:26 - "But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name..."
    <br>- in My name My Father will send this Advocate, which is the Holy Spirit -
    <br>"... will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you".
    <br>That is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Go back to the book of John 14, and also the book of Acts 16:7 and Luke 24:47. That will be very good.
    <br>Also the book of Ephesians 4:30.
    <br>In John 14:26, "... the Father will send in My name,
    <br>will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you".
    <br>It means, without the Holy Spirit, you cannot remember anything of Jesus.
    <br>Holy Spirit. This means if you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true believer.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.
    <br>That is why there is a fashion today - we call one religious and the other Christianity.
    <br>You just choose where you want to belong - religious people or Christianity.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Our heart is the contact point; it is the communication point.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>That is Christianity for you.
    <br>He came to restore the relationship and fellowship between you and God.
    <br>Religious people believe they must go there,
    <br>but our God came to restore the relationship and fellowship between you and God.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.
    <br>You are not born again, you are not a Christian, you are not a true believer.
    <br>How can you be born of the Spirit
    <br>because our God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>That is why you have to be born of the Spirit.
    <br>Going by the book of John 14, when you take your reading from verse 26 onwards,
    <br>and the book of Ephesians 4:30,
    <br>you will find key messages,
    <br>and Acts 16:6-7.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person. Take note of that.
    <br>If the Holy Spirit is a Divine Person, who is standing here?
    <br>Is it T.B. Joshua that is talking to you or the Divine Person?
    <br>In you, Divine Person - if you are a Christian, if you are a believer, if you are born again.
    <br>So, I am here - T.B. Joshua - and the Divine Person standing before you.
    <br>But you don't know who is talking to you.
    <br>What happens will determine.
    <br>Because when the Divine Person talks, changes are beginning.
    <br>It means that I am here, but the appearance you are seeing is Mr T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We have two natures in one person - the divine and human.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person.
    <br>This Divine Person we obtain as a gift from God upon repentance and baptism.
    <br>If you have not repented, you cannot receive that Divine Person.
    <br>You will stand to be preaching, not the Divine Person.
    <br>You have the ability to preach; Divine Person, the Holy Spirit, preaches as He wills.
    <br>You have the ability, you are charismatic, you can talk, but the Holy Spirit also talks as He wills.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit talks, changes are beginning.
    <br>This Divine Person we obtain, we receive as a gift from God, freely from God,
    <br>upon repentance and baptism.
    <br>What is repentance? That is the question.
    <br>Repentance means being deeply sorry for sin.
    <br>I mean, being committed to a new way of life, from unfaithfulness to faithfulness;
    <br>being committed to a new way of life - from disobedience to obedience, from hate to love,
    <br>from unrighteousness to righteousness.
    <br>Being committed to a new way of life, that of serving God, that of following God
    <br>which comes when God's Spirit begins to live in us.
    <br>You cannot do it; no one can do the work of the Cross, only God can.
    <br>You say, "I want to be obedient".
    <br>You want to be obedient? You can be obedient to yourself, but to be obedient to God, you need the Spirit of God.
    <br>This obedience comes when God's Spirit begins to live in us.
    <br>The more you meditate, the more your heart acts upon the Word of God.
    <br>You can preach, I can preach, but the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit preaches, changes are beginning.
    <br>The words we speak in prayer, in counselling,
    <br>if they are not according to the true Word of God,
    <br>I mean, if they are not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>they will be idle, meaningless and often times destructive.
    <br>Because when you call the name 'Jesus' and you are not calling this name by the help of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>when satan hears you, that name is like an eagle.
    <br>When you see an eagle and there are some chickens moving around and the eagle is flying,
    <br>you will see the chickens running for shelter.
    <br>Just the same name 'Jesus' - satan does not even want to know the beginning,
    <br>whether that name is called by the help of the Holy Ghost -
    <br>but merely hearing 'Jesus'.
    <br>If they now realise that you are calling that name by yourself, and not by the help of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>they get you, they beat you. This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>It is like you see a tiger or a lion and you don't know whether it is tied down.
    <br>You only see the lion. My brother, what will you do?
    <br>You don't want to know whether it is tied down or not. You will run for your dear life.
    <br>Before you know that it is tied down, you will run away; you have disappeared.
    <br>Just the same with the name 'Jesus'.
    <br>When satan hears, 'Jesus', "Who is calling the name Jesus?".
    <br>By the time they find you and they realise that the name you are calling is not by the help of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>you will pay dearly for it.
    <br>This is exactly what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>The words we speak in prayer, "In Jesus' name! Be healed!",
    <br>in counselling, in teaching,
    <br>if they are not according to the true Word of God, if they are not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>they will be idle and often times destructive - very dangerous.
    <br>The Bible says in Luke 24:47, "Repentance allows us to receive a new life from God".
    <br>Repentance allows us to receive what?
    <br>Talk to me.
    <br>What allows you to receive a new life? Repentance.
    <br>What is that new life?
    <br>Repentance is our only hope of receiving God's mercy.
    <br>It is your only hope of receiving God's what?
    <br>God's mercy.
    <br>We have the Holy Spirit because God's Word plainly so indicates,
    <br>not because of some emotional sensation.
    <br>When they touch you, you go like this.
    <br>"I've received the Holy Spirit".
    <br>Not because of some emotional sensation.
    <br>We have the Holy Spirit because God's Word plainly so indicates.
    <br>Not, "Hmmm. God. It is the Holy Spirit".
    <br>What kind of Holy Spirit is that?
    <br>Manifestation.
    <br>Not because of some emotional sensation,
    <br>but because God's Word plainly so indicates.
    <br>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23,
    <br>when you take your reading from verse 23,
    <br>we are told that man is a divine being, spirit being. We are told.
    <br>The real thing about man is not his body, but his spirit.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>The real thing about you ...
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing about me is not my body.
    <br>Because when you wake up in the morning you do make-up, you do your hair, you look in the mirror,
    <br>you want to see - you have forgotten the real thing, you have forgotten to dress the real thing,
    <br>you have forgotten to do make-up for the real thing, you have forgotten to put on more hair - wig - for the real thing.
    <br>You have forgotten the real thing.
    <br>Whom are we supposed to take care of first?
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing should be the first priority.
    <br>You are supposed to take care of the real thing -
    <br>bath the real thing, make-up for the real thing, take care of the real thing.
    <br>Because the real thing about you is not your body, but your spirit.
    <br>Today, what are you taking care of?
    <br>Tell me how many times have you looked in the mirror and seen the real thing and know how it looks?
    <br>Some of us we look good, beautiful, handsome, but if you look at your real thing, this is the way you look,
    <br>because we are not taking care of it.
    <br>Some of our real things look like this,
    <br>and you look beautiful.
    <br>Sometimes when I see people moving around, and they have put on a tie,
    <br>when I now look at him to know the real thing in him,
    <br>the real thing looks like this.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You will be very embarrassed when you see your real thing.
    <br>Can you see the life we are living? You will be very embarrassed when God shows you your real thing.
    <br>Some of the real things look like this.
    <br>But you, you look beautiful, handsome.
    <br>You put make-up on in the morning, you wake up, you take care of yourself, you clean your teeth.
    <br>You say, "Ok, can you get me salad?".
    <br>Have you fed your real thing?
    <br>"Salad? Do you have salad here? No, I need salad".
    <br>And the real thing is suffering.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing about me is not my body.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>If God can reveal to you your real thing, your real self, your real value, the way you look, you will cry.
    <br>"Why am I looking so handsome? Look at the real thing, my real value. Look at the way I look".
    <br>In John 8, the Bible says, "When the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed".
    <br>He meant the liberation of your spirit, not your body.
    <br>He meant the liberation of your what?
    <br>Of your spirit - man's spirit.
    <br>The liberation of your spirit - this is what He meant.
    <br>It is a shame. We live life in descending order, instead of ascending order.
    <br>And everything about us is like that.
    <br>You want to do this, you want to do that.
    <br>You keep doing things by yourself, not by the help of the real thing - your real self, your real value.
    <br>You wake up, instead of consulting your real self whom the Holy Spirit works through, you abandon that.
    <br>When the Bible says, "When the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed,
    <br>it means the liberation of your spirit - man's spirit.
    <br>So I'm telling you - look at me - there are two personalities here today, but you don't know.
    <br>There are two personalities:
    <br>The one that puts on the suit is Mr T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and there is another one - my real self.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>You cannot get involved in God's project without your real self.
    <br>Man is a spirit being. You are a spirit being.
    <br>Tell your neighbour. You are a spirit being.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, be healed! Be delivered!".
    <br>They take their time, "Who is talking there? Is it T.B. Joshua that is talking?". If it is T.B. Joshua, he is talking to himself.
    <br>You will only hear him and he will hear himself, but God (will not hear him). He is making a noise; he is talking to the air.
    <br>Can you see the whole world today? We are lost .
    <br>When it comes to the things of the Spirit, we are lost.
    <br>You don't even know whether you are worshipping God.
    <br>Because man cannot do the work of the Cross, only God can.
    <br>When we try to do the work of the Cross by ourselves, we are inflicting pain on ourselves.
    <br>What is the pain? Our words are meaningless, often times destructive, idle. There is pain.
    <br>I'm here now today to say, "Praise the Lord", and you say, "Hallelujah"
    <br>and I am not sent, I'm not inspired, it is not by the help of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and I carry a Bible and say, "Amen! Hallelujah!". You see everybody enjoying it - emotional - everything.
    <br>Oh my God. I am inflicting pain on myself.
    <br>Whatever I will say that day will be meaningless, idle and often times destructive - pain.
    <br>When I finish talking here and I go back to sleep and dream, they will beat me and hurt me.
    <br>Satan will say, "Who sent you? What are you saying? You are talking against us.
    <br>You are rebuking us. Do you know whom you are talking to? Who sent you to say that?"
    <br>They will beat you -  pain. They will beat you mercilessly. They will give you faeces to eat.
    <br>When you wake up, you will not tell anyone. Only you will know what happened to you.
    <br>They will ride you like a bicycle. "Go! Go to your church. Go and preach the Word of God".
    <br>Man has the ability to preach, but the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Intimation must come to us from the Spirit - "Do it this way. Do it that way."
    <br>Suggestion must come from Above to tell you, "Talk to this person. Pray. Stretch your hand."
    <br>"No, don't do that. Go. Look."
    <br>Suggestion must come from the Spirit. If not ...
    <br>Corresponding power. If not, and you now decided to do it on your own because you are well educated,
    <br>you can read the Bible, you understand the Bible.
    <br>The Bible is not literature. The Holy Spirit moved on men of old to document the Holy Word.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>So, we were talking about 1 Thessalonians 5:23,
    <br>that man is a spirit being, he is a divine person possessed of a spirit, soul and body.
    <br>It is possible to identify our body; what of our soul and spirit?
    <br>Shall we say we have no soul and spirit because we cannot identify them -
    <br>because there is no emotional contact to prove their existence
    <br>or there is no emotional reaction to prove their existence?
    <br>Shall we say we have no soul and spirit when God says we have?
    <br>But let me leave you with this word.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If you are not born of the Spirit you are not a Christian.
    <br>No, let me put it this way. There are two Christians -
    <br>if you are not born again, if you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If you are not born again, if you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.
    <br>There must be corresponding power. You must connect with your Father in heaven.
    <br>A suggestion must come from above what to do - an intimation.
    <br>If not, you will continue to live on copy.
    <br>"What did he say? What do they say? What is this? Where will I go?" You will continue to live on copy.
    <br>You know when you are using a copy and it is not original, you know how it is?
    <br>If I want to give you a book, original copy, and I photocopy the original and give you a copy.
    <br>You continue to live a copy life: your business, your life, your health, your joy, your peace.
    <br>There is a copied peace. There is a copied joy. There is a copied business. There is a copied happiness.
    <br>There is a copy.
    <br>Without corresponding power from above,
    <br>without intimation, suggestion.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.
    <br>You can be the richest man in the world without the Spirit of God.
    <br>You can have the largest church congregation all over the world without the Spirit of God.
    <br>Listen to me. You can have the largest church without the Spirit of God - the largest congregation.
    <br>The crowd is not our strength.
    <br>Emmanuel TV is the most watched Christian channel all over the world.
    <br>Emmanuel TV is the most watched Christian channel now - click it - all over the world.
    <br>Ikotun Egbe is a very isolated city here, but you find your way to come.
    <br>The largest church all over the world can be operated without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You can be the richest all over the world without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You can be the most famous all over the world without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Our joy, our main reward is peace of heart.
    <br>All those things you see as a testimony of the Holy Spirit, manifestation of the Holy Spirit, and so on.
    <br>The testimony of the Holy Spirit is peace of heart.
    <br>Because you need that peace of heart. That is why you keep running and you can't eat what you want to eat.
    <br>I want to leave you here. Bless you.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>The real thing about man is not his body, but his spirit.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.
    <br>Our God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person.
    <br>This Divine Person we obtain as a gift from God upon repentance and baptism.
    <br>Repentance is our only hope of receiving God's mercy.
    <br>Repentance means being deeply sorry for sin.
    <br>I mean, being committed to a new way of life from unfaithfulness to faithfulness,
    <br>being committed to a new way of life from disobedience to obedience,
    <br>from hatred to love,
    <br>from unrighteousness to righteousness.
    <br>Being committed to a new way of life - that of serving God, that of following God
    <br>which comes when God's Spirit begins to live in us.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>No one can do the work of the Cross, only God can.
    <br>When the Divine Person talks changes are beginning.
    <br>The word we speak in prayer, in counselling, if they are not according to the true Word of God,
    <br>I mean, if they are not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>they will be idle, meaningless and often times destructive.
    <br>We have the Holy Spirit because God's Word plainly so indicates.
    <br>You cannot get involved in God's projects without your real self.
    <br>Man is a spirit being. You are a spirit being.
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>"As water reflects the face, so one's life reflects the heart"
    <br>Proverbs 27:19
