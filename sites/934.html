    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Andries Coetzee.
    <br>I'm coming from South Africa.
    <br>This is my fiancée Jacqueline.
    <br>This is our baby boy Ethan Coetzee.
    <br>The thing that brought me to The SCOAN was addiction to drugs, cigarettes and drinking.
    <br>I smoked for 22 years and drank for 22 years.
    <br>In between that, I used drugs as a habit.
    <br>In the morning, afternoon and when I wanted to go to bed, I wanted to do drugs.
    <br>I used abusive words on my fiancée.
    <br>I met her three and a half years ago and things were not good with us.
    <br>I never wanted to go to church; I never wanted to talk to God or talk to anybody.
    <br>I just wanted to be by myself and do my work.
    <br>I would be aggressive to work colleagues, especially the ones who were closest to me.
    <br>I had done it for twenty-two years and eight months.
    <br>I have bruises and marks all over my body that I can show you
    <br>because I was drinking and acting aggressively.
    <br>At what age did you start smoking, drinking alcohol?
    <br>Since the age of 16 or 15.
    <br>It has been for how many years now?
    <br>That is about 23 years exactly.
    <br>You said you had some scars on your body.
    <br>Can you show us and tell us these scars came about?
    <br>This is caused by alcohol aggression.
    <br>I would get annoyed and would just want to fight for no reason.
    <br>I was just like the devil was at the back of my mind telling me, “You have to do this”.
    <br>This one was caused by drinking beer.
    <br>This one was caused by smoking weed.
    <br>This one took more than 17 stitches and it was also caused by drugs I was using.
    <br>This one on my leg was from two years ago.
    <br>I got annoyed in the house.
    <br>I wanted to make trouble with me fiancée.
    <br>I took my clothes out of the drawer and started tearing them with a knife.
    <br>It was bad and I started abusing her.
    <br>What happened, how did you get that injury?
    <br>I stepped on the pants and wanted to cut them with a knife.
    <br>The knife didn’t go through the pants; it went straight to my leg.
    <br>It was after taking alcohol?
    <br>It was after taking alcohol.
    <br>You say you smoked cigarettes and what?
    <br>Weed.
    <br>Each time you smoked...
    <br>How did it make you feel?
    <br>How did that affect your life generally?
    <br>It affected the ones close to me most – the annoyance, abuse, fighting and bad temper.
    <br>It affected them and it affected me in a bad way.
    <br>How did the miracle happen?
    <br>My fiancée has a friend in Ghana whom we called.
    <br>One day I said to my fiancée, “Please can you ask your friend for one package from The SCOAN?”
    <br>So, my fiancée spoke to her.
    <br>How did you get to know about The SCOAN?
    <br>I started watching.
    <br>We have DSTV so I changed the channel and saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying and I saw all these great testimonies and people being healed.
    <br>I said I wanted to give my life to God
    <br>because the way I was living was not the way of God; it was the way of the devil.
    <br>Did you, at any time, try to stop these dangerous habits: smoking, taking weeds and alcohol?
    <br>Yes, I made more than seven attempts but there was absolutely nothing, none at all.
    <br>When you saw the Emmanuel TV, what happened?
    <br>When I saw Emmanuel TV, I saw all these great testimonies coming from people.
    <br>I saw people getting healed and delivered.
    <br>That was when I started talking to my fiancée, telling her I needed to change my life
    <br>because my life was going in a wrong direction.
    <br>After asking her friend to get the Morning Water package for us,
    <br>we got it on a Tuesday and we started to pray and anoint ourselves.
    <br>We went on our knees and I said, “God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, if You are there,
    <br>please, listen to me, help me and answer my prayers as I do not want to be the same person”.
    <br>So, you have never been here before?
    <br>Never.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>You requested the package of the Morning Water and after praying with it, the miracle happened.
    <br>Tell us how this addiction finally stopped.
    <br>On Tuesday we got it, we started praying and using it.
    <br>We went on our knees and I started reading the Bible.
    <br>I said, “Please, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, please listen to my prayers, please answer my prayers.
    <br>I know You are annoyed with me because of the wrong doings in my life
    <br>but I know I can change my life around because with You, all things are possible”.
    <br>Nothing is impossible so I said to my fiancée that it is better we use the Morning Water.
    <br>Wow, we can see the emotional expression there.
    <br>We all believe this is born out of great joy, of a deliverance from a bondage of so many years.
    <br>So, after the prayer...?
    <br>After the prayer, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I started feeling itching on my body.
    <br>We took the CD of Prophet T.B. Joshua where he was prophesying.
    <br>We put it in and started listening to the words.
    <br>We went on our knees and touched the TV and I and my fiancée said,
    <br>“Please, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, turn our lives around
    <br>because it is only You who can do it for us; nobody else can do it”.
    <br>Only God can do good things in your life because you cannot do any good thing.
    <br>I started to itch badly.
    <br>For more than thirty to forty minutes, I started to itch all over my body.
    <br>I said to my fiancée, “I’m not feeling well. There is something wrong; I don’t know what’s going on”.
    <br>We went to the room.
    <br>I took off all my clothes and put on new clothes; I thought it was my clothes.
    <br>I said, “No, something is really wrong”.
    <br>I put on the new clothes but I was still itching.
    <br>I went to the back of the door and started scratching my back
    <br>because my back was itching and all over was itching.
    <br>After forty-five minutes of itching, I went on my knees and started to pray.
    <br>I said, “God, please tell me what is happening because I do not know what is happening with myself".
    <br>I have some photos my fiancée took when it was happening.
    <br>After the itching, what happened?
    <br>That is the best part of everything.
    <br>After the itching, I went down on my knees and prayed.
    <br>After praying, I went to the porch – I usually smoked and drank on the porch.
    <br>I went and sat on the porch.
    <br>I took the cigarette and as soon as I lit it and put it in my mouth,
    <br>I said, “Something is not tasting well” and I threw the cigarette down.
    <br>It has been more than two months now that I have not touched beer!
    <br>I do not touch alcohol, cigarettes or drugs!
    <br>Nothing!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>You have some pictures to show us there.
    <br>We would like you to explain what we can see on those pictures.
    <br>This was just after watching the CD when I stared scratching.
    <br>I had scratches on the back and the front.
    <br>This is one of the photos.
    <br>The other one - if you can turn...
    <br>You didn't understand what was itching all over your body?
    <br>Nothing at all.
    <br>The moment the itching stopped - you mean that was the end of urge to smoke and drink?
    <br>That was the end of everything.
    <br>Really, there was no taste for cigarettes.
    <br>I didn’t look at beer; I didn’t want to drink it.
    <br>I just want to tell God, “Thank You!”
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Can we hear a word or two from your fiancée?
    <br>My name is Jacqueline.
    <br>I'm from Liberia.
    <br>This is my fiancé and this is my little baby boy.
    <br>My fiancé has already explained it all.
    <br>Since I met him three years ago, he had been smoking a lot.
    <br>He could smoke three to four packets of cigarettes a day.
    <br>Sometimes, I would really get annoyed with him and would say,
    <br>“Please leave the cigarettes; they are not good for you and they are not good for your health”.
    <br>He would say, “Oh, leave me”.
    <br>Sometimes, even if we didn’t have money,
    <br>we would borrow cigarettes from the nearest shop just for him to smoke.
    <br>It was really bothering me but I just gave all to God, for God to take control.
    <br>Last year in November, we were watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I had been seeing a lot of testimonies and the goodness of God through this ministry.
    <br>So I told him that we should always watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Every night and every morning, we watch Emmanuel TV and then we pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>One day, I called my friend and I said it would be better if we got the Morning Water package
    <br>because through the Morning Water, I had seen a lot of people get their deliverance.
    <br>I believed that we would have our deliverance, too.
    <br>I asked one of my friends in Ghana and she helped.
    <br>She came here and got one Morning Water package for us.
    <br>She sent it to us and as God would have it, we got it.
    <br>It was on a Tuesday we started ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>I ministered it on him first and then I ministered it on myself and on our baby.
    <br>We started praying just like that.
    <br>Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and on Friday we watched the CD.
    <br>As we were watching the CD, we put our hands on the screen.
    <br>Then, I just saw my fiancé scratch his body for thirty to forty-five minutes.
    <br>I asked him what was going on.
    <br>He said he didn’t know and was even confused.
    <br>I said, “OK, let’s go into the room” because we had guests in the house.
    <br>I said, “Let’s go into the room and I will minister the Morning Water on you”.
    <br>We went into the room and took all his clothes off.
    <br>He said, “Maybe the clothes are doing this; maybe they weren’t washed well”.
    <br>I said, “I don’t think so; I think it’s your deliverance”.
    <br>He took off his clothes and I started spraying.
    <br>I said, “You demon, be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You demon, wherever you are, you do not belong in this body!
    <br>Be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!”
    <br>And then we started praying.
    <br>I said, “God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, I know this is our deliverance, in Jesus’ name!”
    <br>I started spraying; that was how he came to himself and then we prayed.
    <br>And since then...?
    <br>Since then, he stopped taking cigarettes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Andries Coetzee & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The next day, my baby fell sick.
    <br>His stomach started running so we took him to the hospital.
    <br>The Morning Sticker – I put it in my baby’s clothes.
    <br>His stomach was running and he was vomiting.
    <br>He was helpless.
    <br>They admitted him and the next morning, as God would have it, he was healed.
    <br>I told my husband and he said we should go to South Africa.
    <br>I said no, we have to come to Nigeria.
    <br>This is our first time here.
    <br>We had to come and testify to the goodness of God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Put your hand together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Lastly, can we hear a word of advice from you?
    <br>I would advise people around the world that have addictions to cigarettes, drugs and alcohol
    <br>to change your life to God because only God can deliver you from this evil.
    <br>Because it is evil; it is a spirit that is not supposed to be in your body.
    <br>Brother, turn yourself to God because God can do wonders.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>We also want to encourage you, now that Jesus Christ has proven His power in your life, -
    <br>it is not enough to come to Jesus to receive help and spiritual healing...
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that when we are healed, blessed or delivered,
    <br>we must follow Jesus Christ, who is the Healer, the blessing Provider,
    <br>and make His Word the standard for our lives, so that whatever we receive from Him
    <br>will be permanent, and even will multiply, in Jesus' name!
    <br>We pray God will give you enough grace to make the Word of God a standard for your life and your family,
    <br>in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again, let's put our hands together for Jesus!
