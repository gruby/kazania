  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>every spirit of addiction,
    <br>whatever stands against your strength -
    <br>when you are weak, then you are strong.
    <br>Whatever stands against your strength,
    <br>your strength in the Lord,
    <br>be cancelled, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every spirit of addiction, be cancelled, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever stands against your strength in the Lord,
    <br>be cancelled, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: It is His will to deliver me.
    <br>It is His will to deliver me.
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>Whatever is that spirit, familiar spirit,
    <br>spirit of your forefathers,
    <br>familiar spirit,
    <br>generational spirit,
    <br>I say, out!
    <br>Say: You must listen!
    <br>Say: You ancestral spirit, you must listen!
    <br>Forefather's spirit, you must listen!
    <br>Familiar spirit, you must listen!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>YOU MUST LISTEN!!!
    <br>Prayer With T.B. Joshua
    <br>If there's any familiar spirit in your life,
    <br>face your neighbour.
    <br>You neighbour, if there is any familiar spirit,
    <br>I say, out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you out!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It is His will to set me free!
    <br>It is His will to deliver me!
    <br>It is His will to set me free!
    <br>Right now, open your lips before we ask for healing.
    <br>Give thanks to God for sending His Word to heal you.
    <br>Give thanks to God for sending His Word to deliver you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>Whatever area in your body,
    <br>whatever position in your health,
    <br>whatever area in your faculties,
    <br>I command that sickness to come out!
    <br>I say, you sickness, out! Come out!
    <br>Right now, begin to command all spirits from your past.
    <br>All spirits from my past,
    <br>that are hindering my present and my future,
    <br>be broken!
    <br>Be captured!
    <br>Be arrested!
    <br>Be captured!
    <br>Be arrested!
    <br>I have arrested them for glory!
    <br>Captured for glory!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>Power!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>YOU MUST LISTEN!!!
