    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>Are you in an attitude of prayer?
    <br>Like I have said,
    <br>faith releases healing power.
    <br>Faith releases blessing.
    <br>Faith is like a vacuum that draws anointing from God.
    <br>You're building faith.
    <br>You are like a ball - it is pumped but it is not well pumped.
    <br>But the more you are saying, take more of me, give me more of you, you are pumping the ball.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of you. You see the ball becoming big.
    <br>You are the ball.
    <br>So if you stop, you stop pumping.
    <br>And if you continue, the ball will continue to grow big.
    <br>You are the ball.
    <br>The air that enters is that faith.
    <br>The word you are saying - take more of me, give me more of you - it's so strong.
    <br>It's spirit prayer.
    <br>When you get that ball to stand and at the level you can play it, you begin to eat with Jesus.
    <br>see visions and dream dreams.
    <br>Your heart will begin to talk to you.
    <br>You don't need to sleep to see vision; it's the heart that talks to us.
    <br>You'll be moving. Your heart would say, Don't go there, go back.
    <br>Who is talking to you?
    <br>It's your heart, pumped by faith - get it working.
    <br>See with your heart and not with your eye.
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>Every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God, be broken, in Jesus' name!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>We want to fight this barrier.
    <br>Whatever barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>What could be the barrier? - It could be offence you are holding against your neighbour.
    <br>You say, over your dead body, you will not forgive!
    <br>Are you holding an offence, grudges, hatred, bitterness or pain of the past?
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I want you to stretch your hand and begin to remove whatever satan might have used to connect you.
    <br>He uses offence to connect us. He uses grudges to connect us to himself.
    <br>He uses pain of the past to connect us to himself. He uses bitterness to connect us to himself.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself, begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I want to believe you are with a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that joins with the Spirit of God.
    <br>Right now.
    <br>Whatever strange spirit around, within or outside,
    <br>we want to put them where they belong, we want to tell them where they should go.
    <br>Right now.
    <br>Every familiar spirit!
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>You familiar spirit!
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>You familiar spirit!
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>Every familiar spirit!
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>Whatever spirit - within or outside that torments your business, life, that stands in your way -
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>be cursed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every knee, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every enemy shall surrender, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every enemy shall surrender.
    <br>I say to your enemy - surrender!
    <br>Surrender!
    <br>Enemy of progress,
    <br>enemy of your health,
    <br>enemy of your finances,
    <br>enemy of your business,
    <br>enemy of your career,
    <br>enemy of your future,
    <br>enemy of your destiny,
    <br>enemy of your family,
    <br>enemy of your marriage,
    <br>enemy of your country!
    <br>Open your lips!

    <br>All enemies shall surrender when hearing the name of Jesus.
    <br>Why should yours not surrender?
    <br>In the name of Jesus!

    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>All enemies shall surrender, including yours. Put them where they belong!
    <br>Command them!

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I destroyed her!
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>I'm a giant man. I want to kill her.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>I caused her barrenness; I want to destroy her.
    <br>We are soldiers
    <br>Soldiers of the Lord

    <br>Soldiers of the Lord
    <br>In the name of Jesus we shall conquer
    <br>We are soldiers
    <br>Soldiers of the Lord
    <br>In the name of Jesus we shall conquer
    <br>In the name of Jesus we have conquered
    <br>Give thanks to God and believe it is done!
    <br>It is done!
    <br>Give thanks to Him!
    <br>I pray that the Lord exposes your weakness and delivers you!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>Every weakness - be exposed and be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>You have been delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You have been set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Do you know what it means when an anointed man of God says you have been set free?
    <br>Now in this case, the choice is yours.
    <br>You can choose to say, "I have been set free". You can choose to say, "No, I am not yet set free".
    <br>You have been set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>You have been set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>I can see you walking in liberty!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>I can see you walking in liberty!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>I can see you walking in freedom!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>I can see you walking in breakthrough!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Let the people of God say 'Amen'!
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>The question is, do you know yourself?
    <br>Do you know you have been delivered?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, do you know yourself? Do you know you have been delivered?
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Let me see your excitement!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Because I'm happy that you have been set free!

    <br>Ask God to redeem your nation, your country.
    <br>Redeem my nation. Redeem my country.
    <br>Oh Lord, redeem my leader.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Every attack of the enemy,
    <br>corruption,
    <br>misappropriation,
    <br>idolatry,
    <br>misrule,
    <br>misjudge.
    <br>Ask God to redeem your nation.
    <br>Say, Lord, redeem my nation.
    <br>Redeem my leaders.
    <br>Redeem my nation.
    <br>Every effort of the enemy, every weapon of the enemy used to attack my nation -
    <br>corruption, misappropriation, misrule, misjudge, idolatry.
    <br>Right now, begin to pray for your nation. Ask God to redeem your nation.

    <br>Give thanks to God!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess whom you are.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Those of you that have come for the first time
    <br>and you are knowing Jesus for the first time, say after me:
    <br>Lord Jesus, I am a sinner, come into my heart,
    <br>wash me with Your precious blood, save my soul.
    <br>Lord Jesus, You are my Saviour.
    <br>Thank You for my salvation.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.

    <br>Hallelujah!
