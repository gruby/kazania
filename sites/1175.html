  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers, thank you for your time.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today, we’ll talk about how to be filled with the Holy Ghost as a Christian.
    <br>If Christians need to be filled with the Holy Ghost; how?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>How?
    <br>HOW TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT
    <br>It is a core and fundamental area of the Gospel – to be filled with the Holy Ghost
    <br>because you cannot do anything for God, as far as God is concerned,
    <br>you cannot represent God, be involved in God’s projects without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>He who sees Him sees the Holy Ghost.
    <br>You cannot be a Christian without Him.
    <br>You know Jesus – you know the Holy Ghost.
    <br>This is why today we say, ‘Christians’ and ‘true Christians’.
    <br>It means there are Christians and there are also true ones.
    <br>In every area of life, there are fake; there are true.
    <br>Which one are you?
    <br>For several years I have been experiencing an encounter in this area,
    <br>going by what we are seeing every day in the ministry here.
    <br>This is an apostolic ministry - not just a ministry, but an apostolic ministry.
    <br>So, several years of experience and encounter.
    <br>I am going to share with you my personal experience, supported with the Holy Bible.
    <br>Referring you to those areas in the Bible -
    <br>my personal experience I'm going to share with you.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>I am not going to say much about baptism of water, which is a human act.
    <br>When you are OK, they will just usher you for that baptism.
    <br>So, today, we will use Apostle Peter.
    <br>We are not going to go deep on baptism of water, but the Holy Ghost.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>We have many books to support this,
    <br>but I will take my proof reading from the Book of Acts 10 - that will be my proof reading.
    <br>The other Book you have is John 14:26 - that will really help you.
    <br>And 1 Corinthians 12:1 – end.
    <br>That will really help.
    <br>And 1 Corinthians 2:13.
    <br>And Romans 14 about this issue of faith;
    <br>anything that does not come from faith is sin - Romans 14:5 - end.
    <br>And the Book of Colossians 3, and Ephesians 5 - that will help.
    <br>When you get home, take those Books, listen to the message.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Take the Book about 7 sons of Sceva - Acts 19:13.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>So, let's take the Book of Acts 10.
    <br>Cornelius called for Peter - I'm just taking reading from verse 1.
    <br>“At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion
    <br>in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
    <br>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing;
    <br>he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.”
    <br>So, let's take our proof reading there - verse 44.
    <br>“While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.
    <br>The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished
    <br>that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles" -
    <br>that is unbelievers; people they were not expecting that this could reach, be poured on.
    <br>“For they heard them speaking in tongues"
    <br>We will talk about all this today.
    <br>“For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,”
    <br>‘Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water.'"
    <br>Like I told you, the baptism by water is a human act; take note of that.
    <br>“’They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have’.
    <br>So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.”
    <br>Why should Peter have stayed with them for a few days?
    <br>For counselling, for guidance, for the purpose.
    <br>You have several Books here today, which are going to help you.
    <br>- Hallelujah.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Christians must be filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You must be filled with the Holy Spirit to be a Christian.
    <br>No one can do the work of God without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Doing it without the Holy Spirit is tantamount to taking huge affliction, trouble, pain.
    <br>The Bible says that not everyone who says "Jesus is Lord" will do things with the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You can say, do and preach, without the help of the Holy Spirit
    <br>but you will find that you are inflicting pain, wounds, harm on yourself.
    <br>So, let's quote Peter.
    <br>While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on the hearers.
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>It means it fell on those who believed,
    <br>on those who prepared for the Holy Ghost,
    <br>meaning that God owned Peter’s words and bore witness to Peter’s words.
    <br>In other words, he was sent by God Himself.
    <br>That is the evidence to show he was sent by God Himself.
    <br>It was not Peter - it was a representative, an ambassador.
    <br>I will take you one by one, like I have told you - I'm going to share my encounter with the Holy Ghost,
    <br>so that it will be easy for you.
    <br>If I'm talking about what is in the Bible alone, it may seem to be difficult for you, but let's go.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>To be prepared for the Holy Ghost - "I want to be baptized, I really want to be filled with the Holy Ghost."
    <br>The step you are going to take:
    <br>Listen to me with all your heart.
    <br>You must listen to me with all your what?
    <br>- Heart.
    <br>The heart that holds grudges, offence, pain of the past – this is where your problem comes from.
    <br>Everyone here holds one offence or the other.
    <br>Unforgivingness - everyone here.
    <br>Viewers, listen to me:
    <br>Everyone holds one offence or the other.
    <br>You are claiming your rights, "How can I be cheated, insulted? Why?"
    <br>Whether you are cheated or not, offence is a crime to God.
    <br>Listen to me with all your heart but not a heart that holds offence or pain of the past.
    <br>But you are holding offence.
    <br>In the process of claiming your right, you are holding offence.
    <br>That is why it will be difficult for you to have my message with all your heart.
    <br>You will hear, you will see me as a lecturer...
    <br>In the school you hear, and it will go into your what?
    <br>Mental assent?
    <br>You receive it but not in your heart.
    <br>To receive the message with all your heart, your heart must be free.
    <br>Heart means man’s spirit.
    <br>How many of us have a free heart here today?
    <br>Heart that does not hold grudges, offence, heart that has nothing to do with yesterday,
    <br>whatever happened, unless the one that glorified God.
    <br>This is where you are!
    <br>This is why it will be difficult for you to listen to me with all your heart.
    <br>I'm sharing with you how you can be baptised,
    <br>how you can be filled with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Listen!
    <br>You must listen to me with all your heart – a heart that does not hold offence.
    <br>Speak to yourself in Psalms in your heart as you are listening to me.
    <br>There is no neutral heart. You can't say, "Hm, I don't want to talk".
    <br>If you don’t want to talk, your heart will talk.
    <br>Something is going on.
    <br>Don’t allow your spirit to take hold of you; you control it.
    <br>"I must control you. While I'm listening to T.B. Joshua, I must control my heart."
    <br>Speak to yourself in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs,
    <br>making melodies in your heart to God.
    <br>But how many hearts now are engaged in those...?
    <br>A lot of things are going on in your heart.
    <br>"What is going to happen today?"
    <br>Don’t allow your heart to control you.
    <br>As a Christian, speak to your heart in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.
    <br>Make melodies in your heart.
    <br>That is how to receive.
    <br>By the time you get hold of your heart, you are about to be filled.
    <br>You cannot get hold of your heart; your heart is jumping up and down.
    <br>A lot of things are going on, "My business. Let me look at my time."
    <br>That is why sometimes you don't need to go to the restroom, the diabetes you are talking about.
    <br>It is because you are not getting hold of your heart.
    <br>When your heart is jumping, "I have not gone to the toilet today"
    <br>- immediately you have the sense of going to the toilet.
    <br>"I have not eaten today" - immediately you have the sense of eating.
    <br>"I have not made a call to my brother today" - immediately you receive a call.
    <br>The real battle is in our heart.
    <br>For - against.
    <br>If you can control your heart, get hold of your heart, the sky is your limit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you can get hold of your heart, the sky is your limit.
    <br>You leave your heart; you are looking at me and your heart is free to say whatever it wants to say.
    <br>Don't allow that!
    <br>As you are looking at me, take hold of your heart.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You; more of Your faithfulness, kindness, goodness..." -
    <br>a lot of Bible Psalms, hymns, melodies.
    <br>"Jesus, Jesus..." - that alone is OK.
    <br>"Jesus, Jesus..."
    <br>"Jesus, locate me in Your mercy."
    <br>Give your heart assignments.
    <br>If you don’t give your heart assignments, your heart will look for assignments.
    <br>"Oh, look at that hair-style. Look at that dress.
    <br>Look at that beautiful woman. Look at that handsome man.
    <br>This church - there are a lot of changes. Oh my God."
    <br>Your heart will be roaming about.
    <br>If you don't give a message to your heart, your heart will be just doing whatever,
    <br>"Look at the fruit; will I have one today? What is going to happen? Oh, this church is beautiful.
    <br>Oh, look at this man; I like his suit - I think I can get it.
    <br>I saw one jeep at the car-park today; I think I'm going to make a photo of this jeep."
    <br>Your heart keeps roaming about; this is what is putting you in trouble.
    <br>This is what will distance you from God.
    <br>This is why you are not filled with the Spirit.
    <br>Talk to your heart!
    <br>Keep your heart busy; get hold of your heart!
    <br>This is my life.
    <br>When I'm going, I will not even know that you are passing me, because I'm busy in my heart.
    <br>You think that because I am not talking I am not busy - I am busy.
    <br>Sometimes, when I watch TV, a football game...
    <br>You think that I'm watching football; only my eyes are watching but my heart,
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You. Lord".
    <br>By the time I say, "Jesus!" - maybe someone is wounded on the field -
    <br>it means what I'm saying is what I...
    <br>Or when I'm sleeping, my nature is to keep my heart busy.
    <br>I give my heart a job, not my heart giving me job.
    <br>Your heart is giving you job.
    <br>When I'm sleeping - you think I'm sleeping; it is only my body.
    <br>Come and attack me.
    <br>I say, "Jesus!"
    <br>But you, "Honey!"
    <br>Which honey?
    <br>Can honey help you?
    <br>Your honey will say, "What has happened, dear?"
    <br>"Don't worry, these people."
    <br>Some will say, "Leave me!"
    <br>"What is happening? Honey, what is wrong?"
    <br>The name of Jesus is "leave me" - this is the life you are living.
    <br>Even when you are inside a vehicle, and the car is about to get an accident;
    <br>in the process of somersaulting, "Honey, Honey!"
    <br>Can your honey help you?
    <br>Because you are not used to it.
    <br>At the end of the day; maybe you are trapped, they are giving you food in the dream,
    <br>or the accident has happened, you say, "Jesus!"
    <br>It has happened already - why are you calling Jesus?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Don't forget our message today.
    <br>HOW TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT
    <br>The Word and the Spirit are inseparable; that is, intimately linked together.
    <br>The Word and the Spirit - you cannot separate these.
    <br>You cannot just come and say, "Jesus!"
    <br>By what authority are you calling Jesus?
    <br>The Word and the Spirit are intimately linked together.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you want to live, talk, smile, sleep, eat in the Spirit, keep in the Word,
    <br>live in the Word, abide in the Word and become totally saturated with the Scripture.
    <br>You will find yourself overflowing with the Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you want to live in the Spirit, that is, to be filled with the Spirit,
    <br>living in the Spirit is living with Jesus.
    <br>Sleeping in the Spirit is sleeping with Jesus.
    <br>Eating in the Spirit is eating with Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you want to live in the Spirit, keep in the Word, abide in the Word,
    <br>become totally saturated with the Scripture and you will find yourself overflowing with the Spirit.
    <br>Not just flow, but overflowing with the Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I may take you back again, because I don't want this message to just go.
    <br>I'm not a lecturer, I'm just telling you the message God has given me to tell you.
    <br>What is going on in your heart now?
    <br>Madam, as you are sitting, you must take control of your heart.
    <br>If you don't take control of your heart, your heart will be jumping up and down.
    <br>You will see someone who put a wig on there, someone who is talking there,
    <br>someone who is shouting there, someone...
    <br>You will be looking at T.B. Joshua, "Oh, this is a beautiful attire".
    <br>Take hold of your heart.
    <br>Now, continue to speak to your heart in hymns, in psalms,
    <br>"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. Take more of me, give me more of You."
    <br>A lot of things, messages, spiritual songs in your heart, make melody in your heart to God,
    <br>"Thank You, Lord... Jesus Christ... Locate me in Your mercy..."
    <br>Keep busy in your heart.
    <br>Before you know it, you will start speaking in tongues, you will find yourself in another realm.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Not only here.
    <br>When you are at home, when you are eating, "Locate me in Your mercy..."
    <br>When your heart is talking, your lips cannot move - I'm just telling you what your heart will engage in.
    <br>"Locate me in Your mercy. Take more of me." - you have to engage your heart.
    <br>That is the prayer.
    <br>The prayers you are offering today are not prayers.
    <br>The real prayer is engaging your heart, "Take more of me, give me more of You" - that is the prayer.
    <br>But the one you offer, "Lord Jesus - thank You, Lord..." - that is not prayer, you are speaking to yourself.
    <br>That is why your prayers are not answered.
    <br>The real prayer...
    <br>When you begin to engage your heart, you will not go where Jesus will not be welcome.
    <br>You will not say what Jesus would not want you to say.
    <br>I want to ask a question.
    <br>When did the Spirit move?
    <br>It was when Peter started speaking that the Spirit began to move.
    <br>Before I will go further; I hope you have captured how to be filled?
    <br>Have you captured it?
    <br>Your heart, I repeat again,
    <br>keep your heart; get hold of your heart.
    <br>You allow your heart to continue to throw you into problems and afflictions,
    <br>throwing you over this, diabetes, this, that, thinking about that - no!
    <br>Speak to your heart.
    <br>You see me going; I'm engaging my heart, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>I'm telling you now what I engage my heart with.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus..."
    <br>I'm saying, "Thank You, Jesus" in my heart, but my lips - no one knows.
    <br>If you call me, I will answer you, I will greet you, because it is my heart that is engaged, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>If somebody just comes out to attack me, that attack Jesus will... - He will defend me.
    <br>You always wait for an attack, before you call Jesus.
    <br>You always wait for the situation, before you call Jesus.
    <br>You always wait for a time when you need Him, before you call Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You don’t know how much you need Him.
    <br>I cannot heart you.
    <br>You don’t know how much you need Him.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>You don’t know how much you need Him.
    <br>Me? - I don't wait for anything.
    <br>As I'm walking, "Locate me in Your mercy...", but my lips are OK, you cannot know.
    <br>That's why sometimes, when you call me, "Good Morning, sir",
    <br>I don't answer promptly because I'm busy.
    <br>If you call me, when you engage with me on the phone, "Hello!",
    <br>you think I can't hear what you are saying; I hear, but because my heart is engaged -
    <br>"How are you? Where are you now? OK, I'm in the church."
    <br>Because I'm screening your voice to know who is talking - whether it is ogbanje or witchcraft.
    <br>Voice is more powerful than anything.
    <br>OK, last Sunday you saw what happened.
    <br>I stood here and I began to say, "In the name of Jesus...", out there you saw people vomiting,
    <br>coming out, pool of blood, menstruation, fibroid, everything - you saw it.
    <br>Voice - it is voice!
    <br>At home, all over the world people are getting delivered by mere looking at me, listening to me.
    <br>So, this handset...
    <br>They get you proper there.
    <br>Not everybody listening to me is going to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Going by what we have read in Acts 10:44,
    <br>not everybody listening to me is going to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>I would not want you to come and kneel down and ask God to fill you
    <br>when you are not prepared.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I would not want you to come and kneel down and ask God to fill you
    <br>when you are not prepared
    <br>because the Holy Ghost is not received by everyone, only those who are prepared for Him.
    <br>And I have told you about the preparation, which you have received today.
    <br>Get hold of your heart.
    <br>Speak to yourself in Psalms.
    <br>Speak to yourself in hymns.
    <br>Speak to yourself in spiritual songs.
    <br>Make melodies in your heart to God.
    <br>Colossians 3, Ephesians 5 - you will find it there.
    <br>I would like to have you meditate on the Scriptures.
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible,
    <br>and turn it over and over again in your heart,
    <br>the more your heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>Turn it over and over again in your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Turn it over and over again in your heart."
    <br>You know what I mean?
    <br>It is like you are pounding yam; turn it over...
    <br>The more your heart, your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Acts upon the Word.
    <br>It’s not just to read.
    <br>Read!
    <br>Turn it over and over again in your heart, what you read;
    <br>the more your heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>If you are not grounded in the Word,
    <br>there will be nothing for the Spirit to hold on.
    <br>In the Book of John 14:26 it says,
    <br>there will be nothing for the Spirit to remind you of.
    <br>That is John 14:26.
    <br>It must remind you of: thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not destroy, thou shalt not this, thou shalt not that.
    <br>If you are not grounded in the Word of God, there will be nothing for the Spirit to remind you of:
    <br>thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not...
    <br>If there is nothing...
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the extent, measure, degree
    <br>we stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to you to the extent, measure, degree
    <br>you stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How do you honour His Word?
    <br>You say, "Jesus must be honoured...in my life every day".
    <br>They are talking about His Word.
    <br>Jesus and His Word are one.
    <br>The Spirit will be released to you to the extent, degree, measure
    <br>you stand in reverence, honour of His Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must be sure that you can.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must be sure that you can.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Secondly, before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must desire that.
    <br>You read so much about the Spirit of God.
    <br>You read about an accommodation that you need to prepare for the Spirit of God.
    <br>What is the accommodation?
    <br>What He wants, what He doesn't want - put those things together.
    <br>Put your home in order.
    <br>If your home is in disarray, disorder - you must think how to arrange your home before He comes.
    <br>Before you can be filled with the Spirit, you must be sure that you can.
    <br>I'm telling you my personal experience of several years and supporting it with the scripture for you.
    <br>If I now go into the Scripture, begin to tell you when I'm not filled,
    <br>definitely, it would be difficult for you to understand.
    <br>That is why what you are reading over and over, everywhere, you cannot practice.
    <br>Are you sure that you want to be possessed by a Spirit?
    <br>Are you sure that you can be possessed by a Spirit?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This Spirit is like Jesus.
    <br>There are two kinds of spirit possession.
    <br>Evil spirit possession, where the human personality is taken over -
    <br>making them filthy, dumb or evil as we can see them being delivered or cast out today.
    <br>The Holy Spirit wants to possess us Christians.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Holy Spirit wants to possess us Christians
    <br>because there is no way you can be a Christian without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The Holy Ghost wants to possess us Christians.
    <br>This Spirit is like Jesus.
    <br>Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?
    <br>You know Jesus – you know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>If truly you know Jesus, are you ready to be possessed by a Spirit that is like Jesus?
    <br>I know Jesus – I know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I know Jesus – I know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>If truly you know Jesus, you know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Because we are not sure; truly, we don't know Jesus.
    <br>You say you know Jesus and you don't know the Holy Spirit -
    <br>it means you don't know Jesus.
    <br>You say, "I know Jesus", but you don't know the Holy Spirit -
    <br>it means you don't know Jesus.
    <br>Many people say they are Christians; they are not Christians, they are religious people.
    <br>You say you are a Christian.
    <br>If truly you are a Christian, you know Jesus, and if you know Jesus, you know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But here, I can't see the Holy Spirit in the life of people.
    <br>You know Jesus?
    <br>You know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Truly, if you know Jesus, you know the Holy Spirit because they are inseparable,
    <br>intimately linked together.
    <br>It is when one is filled with the Spirit, then you can be baptised.
    <br>But you are not filled with the Holy Spirit and you are now going for a baptism -
    <br>you can never be filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is the challenge you are facing.
    <br>You say you are not a graduate, you never attended university,
    <br>but you bought a certificate that you have 2nd class upper.
    <br>Can you now go back to the university?
    <br>That is the problem you are facing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Because you have been baptised by water, it is difficult for you to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Because things are in ascending order, but now you are taking descending order.
    <br>You know you are not filled with the Spirit, but you are now being baptised.
    <br>You can tell your pastor, "Pastor please, I'm not filled with the Holy Spirit. Don't baptise me; it's a curse".
    <br>Can't you hear what Peter said, "We cannot stop these people from being baptised by the water
    <br>because they are filled".
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If you are not a graduate and you bought a certificate which says you are a graduate,
    <br>and you say you have 2nd class upper and you are now working,
    <br>can you now turn around and say, "I'm going to the university"?
    <br>Will they not query you about the certificate you have?
    <br>So, the same way, you are baptised in the water;
    <br>can you now turn around and say, "I need the Holy Spirit now"?
    <br>Unless you are delivered.
    <br>Say, "I need deliverance".
    <br>Deliverance of what?
    <br>Of water baptism.
    <br>You need deliverance?
    <br>Deliverance of what?
    <br>- Water baptism.
    <br>Even to say it out, it is difficult for you.
    <br>Deliverance of what?
    <br>- Water baptism.
    <br>You have been baptised with the water.
    <br>Double...
    <br>Overhauling.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>Yes, we are on the way to the filling.
    <br>After this message, I know you will know the way out now.
    <br>The way out has come.
    <br>Halleluja!
    <br>If you claim to know Jesus and you don’t know the Holy Spirit, you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>What is the role of the Holy Spirit?
    <br>A Spirit – pure, sane, gentle, wise, loving – for that is exactly what He is like.
    <br>A Spirit – pure, sane, gentle, wise – for that is exactly what He is like.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Holy Spirit is pure – He is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He is wise for He is the Spirit of Wisdom.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He is true for He is the Spirit of Truth.
    <br>He is like Jesus for He is the Spirit of Christ.
    <br>He is like the Father for He is the Spirit of the Father.
    <br>This Spirit wants to possess you.
    <br>This Spirit wants to be your Lord
    <br>so that you will no longer be in control
    <br>of the little vessel in which you sail - your body.
    <br>You know, I'm the one sailing this one - this is a little vessel.
    <br>He wants to be in charge and take over from me because without Him, I will not be able to stand;
    <br>I will not be able to be pure, wise, loving, gentle.
    <br>He wants to take control of this little vessel and sail it by Himself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you sure you want to be possessed by the blessed Spirit of the Father and Son?
    <br>Because you often like to be in charge – founder, general overseer.
    <br>“I want to do this today, another tomorrow”,
    <br>whereas God owns our future.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>Again, ask your neighbour.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>Again.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>Again.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be possessed by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>Do you want your personality to be taken over by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>You will not wake up and say, "Yes, help me iron these three suits.
    <br>I will wear this one on Monday, this one on Tuesday, this one on Wednesday"; as if you are God.
    <br>How do you know that you will see tomorrow?
    <br>Tell me.
    <br>We are in the world; you have seen so much.
    <br>People say, "I will see you tomorrow" - the next thing you learn is that person is in the graveyard.
    <br>Do you want your personality to be taken over by Someone who is like Jesus?
    <br>If you want that, begin to see today as if it is your last day on earth.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>If you want that, begin to see today as if it is your last day on earth.
    <br>If you want your personality to be taken over by Someone who is like Jesus,
    <br>right now, begin to see now as if it’s your last day on earth.
    <br>Now, begin to see today as if it’s your last day on earth.
    <br>If you see today as if it is your last day on earth - you know;
    <br>all those things you keep somewhere...
    <br>There are poor people on the street; instead of sharing with them, helping them, you promise this or that...
    <br>This is all propaganda.
    <br>How do you know?
    <br>Begin to see today as if it’s your last day on earth
    <br>if you want your personality to be taken over by Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are not filled with the Spirit, you cannot obey the written Word.
    <br>Let me show you.
    <br>You see it?
    <br>Let me see your own.
    <br>Raise your own up.
    <br>Say to yourself.
    <br>If I am not filled with the Spirit, I cannot obey the written Word.
    <br>This is why all what you are reading here is like literature to you.
    <br>It is just mere literature.
    <br>You read to preach, to teach; you don't read to live in it.
    <br>You cannot live it; you cannot read what is here, if you are not filled with the Spirit.
    <br>You can preach, you read it to teach it, to preach it, to counsel people,
    <br>but to live in it, you cannot because there is no way you can.
    <br>If you don’t obey the Scripture, you quench Him.
    <br>Can you see the importance of the Spirit?
    <br>If you don’t obey the Scripture, you quench Him;
    <br>you are not a Christian, irrespective of your knowledge in the Bible.
    <br>If you are not filled with the Spirit of God, you cannot obey the Word of God
    <br>because the holy men were carried along by the Spirit as they were writing the Word.
    <br>It is not a literature, it is not something you can put here.
    <br>You can memorize it, you can keep it in your mind - but to keep it in your heart, no way without the Spirit.
    <br>I want to leave you.
    <br>Can you give me your word?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can somebody answer this question?
    <br>How will you be filled with the Spirit?
    <br>Can somebody?
    <br>Because without the Spirit of God you cannot obey the written Word.
    <br>You are not filled with the Spirit and you are carrying the Bible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You are not filled with the Spirit and you are carrying the Bible.
    <br>The Bible you carry is not only a Bible; there is a Bible and there is Holy Bible.
    <br>The Bible is history, events that happened to apostles and God's generals,
    <br>but the holy, it has to do...
    <br>OK, can somebody answer this question?
    <br>How will you be filled with the Spirit?
    <br>OK, give it to my brother.
    <br>By meditating upon His Word.
    <br>What are you meditating on?
    <br>The Word of God.
    <br>- Are you doing that now?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Now, now, now?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Can you tell us what are you meditating on?
    <br>Psalm 28:7.
    <br>- As you are looking at me?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Even as you are talking to me?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>While you are talking to me, you cannot stop your meditation.
    <br>Meditation is a thing of the heart; it is different from thinking.
    <br>Thinking is lower level; upper level is meditation.
    <br>Meditation has to do with Heaven, knowledge of Heaven
    <br>but thinking has to do with your challenges.
    <br>When you say, "Ha, how will I get out of this mess now?", you are thinking.
    <br>"How will I sleep now?" - you are thinking.
    <br>"Oh, I don't know what is wrong." - you are thinking.
    <br>That thinking leads to depression.
    <br>When you are meditating, you can answer people, you can talk to people.
    <br>You can greet people while you are meditating.
    <br>Let me hear from my brother.
    <br>- You mean you are meditating now?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- As you are talking to me?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>And when this thing becomes part of you, over the time, then your blood and fluids will cooperate.
    <br>Right now at the beginning, your blood will not cooperate.
    <br>You know, blood cooperates - when you move, the blood flows,
    <br>but right now, when you begin, your blood will not cooperate.
    <br>You will find it difficult - the beginning of everything is like that.
    <br>When you wanted to start crawling when you were a baby...
    <br>You were an embryo - see what you have become today.
    <br>This is why we give you faith bracelets.
    <br>Who has a faith bracelet here?
    <br>Oh yes - come on, bring your own.
    <br>This is why we have this.
    <br>It helps you to meditate.
    <br>Unlike religious people - when they have it, you see their mouth...
    <br>It is for meditation to reset your belief.
    <br>If you meditate, you can still be talking to people and be going on.
    <br>So, thank you very much - clap for my brother.
    <br>Anyone else there?
    <br>My brother here wants to tell us the way he will be filled today.
    <br>When you are filled with God's Word through meditation, it helps you to obey the Word,
    <br>because your heart will not occupy you; instead, you will occupy your heart.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>The advantage of this is that it will reset your belief, focus.
    <br>Many of us talk too much; we are lying.
    <br>This thing will reset your faith, your belief.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Who else?
    <br>The little girl here.
    <br>Are you in that business of meditation now?
    <br>Now, you know the meaning of meditation:
    <br>Speak to yourself in hymns, Psalms and spiritual songs.
    <br>Make melodies in your heart all the time.
    <br>Before you know it, you are filled.
    <br>This heart is the challenge you have.
    <br>Your heart is the one controlling you, directing you
    <br>but right now, it is time to take hold of your heart.
    <br>"No, my heart - you have been embarrassing me."
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>In order for you to be filled with the Spirit, you need to be grounded in the Word,
    <br>so that the Holy Spirit will have something to hold on to.
    <br>If you are not grounded in the Word, the Holy Spirit will not have anything to remind you of.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>In order to be filled, you have to be grounded in the Word.
    <br>You have to be sane in your heart.
    <br>If not, the Holy Spirit will have nothing to remind you of.
    <br>"Thou shalt not kill" from the Bible - He is the One telling us this.
    <br>So please, thank you.
    <br>Anyone else?
    <br>Give it to the sister there.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>Since I know what the Holy Spirit means by...
    <br>Before, I used to be angry and aggressive to my six kids.
    <br>You used to be...?
    <br>Aggressive, angry.
    <br>This thing has given me heart attack, hypertension, blood pressure.
    <br>My daughter said, "Look, if you want to live long, you have to be calm".
    <br>Really, I remember the Holy Spirit working for me, since I started meditating.
    <br>I remember when daddy brought out this faith bracelet - "take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>Let us see your...
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You, Holy Spirit.
    <br>Thank you, clap for her.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>When this faith bracelet was given, the language followed - "take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>I have given you another one today: "Locate me in Your mercy...
    <br>Locate me in Your favour, locate me in Your mercy...
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>Even when I'm praying for you, you continue to do that meditation,
    <br>"Locate me in Your favour, locate me in Your mercy".
    <br>Thank you, my sister.
    <br>Anyone else?
    <br>OK, give it to my brother there.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>It is my first time in The SCOAN.
    <br>I listen to Emmanuel TV all the time.
    <br>Emmanuel TV has changed my life.
    <br>I didn't read the Bible before, until I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When I started watching Emmanuel TV, I saw the man of God preaching,
    <br>giving advice that we should be meditating - "Give me more of You, God, take more of me".
    <br>I imbibed that caution.
    <br>I'm a clinical pharmacist; I have my own clinical pharmacy.
    <br>I counsel patients, I see them on a daily basis.
    <br>On this occasion, I was in my office attending to patients.
    <br>I had imbibed the caution of "Give me more of You, take more of me".
    <br>This time I was doing that.
    <br>I was attending to a patient and I was meditating, "Give me more of You, take more of me".
    <br>Behold!
    <br>The mother and the daughter.
    <br>After the mother had complained, the daughter followed.
    <br>While I was talking, I was meditating, "Give me more of You, take more of me, Lord..."
    <br>I then asked the girl, "How are you? What is your name?"
    <br>I said, "Shake me".
    <br>The moment I shook the hand of this girl, she said, "Leave me! Do you know me
    <br>Do you know who I am? You see me small. I'm a big woman".
    <br>The mother, sitting next to her, didn't know anything.
    <br>In fact, I was shocked.
    <br>I was looking, and I said, "Glory be to God. God of Prophet T.B. Joshua has taken me to this realm.
    <br>I want to go deeper to the other realm."
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>You remember what I told you, that the prayer you used to offer -
    <br>all this while, you are wasting your time.
    <br>The prayer is all about heart, but your prayer is all about your mouth.
    <br>You are just wasting your time.
    <br>Each time I see people say, "In the name of Jesus...", I say, "Ooo - you are inviting an attack".
    <br>Will you reset yourself now and start this meditation - that is the prayer you need now.
    <br>As you are sitting, what is going on in your heart?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What is going on in your heart?
    <br>Have you taken hold of your heart?
    <br>Are you in charge?
    <br>Speak to yourself in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.
    <br>Make melodies in your heart."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You see what is happening now.
    <br>He was meditating in his heart, no one knew what he was saying in his heart,
    <br>but mere stretching hand to the little one, "Leave me! I'm this" - she started confessing.
    <br>You keep deceiving yourself - you say you are praying.
    <br>Those who are not supposed to pray for you are praying for you;
    <br>you are better than them but they are praying for you.
    <br>Prayer has become a culture, a tradition.
    <br>Prayer is not a tradition, it’s as it should be by divine will.
    <br>You wake up in the morning, you say, "Let's pray".
    <br>Instead of counselling your family first, "Hello. Good morning. What has happened?
    <br>What happened yesterday? I corrected you yesterday. I told you not to do this.
    <br>I hope you have learnt your lesson from it. OK. What is going on in your school. Please, come on.
    <br>The way you look is not right, you keep malice. Please, be cheerful as a Christian.
    <br>Do you have any pain? What is worrying you?"
    <br>These are counsels you need to give to your family.
    <br>After that counselling you will then tell them about Jesus, the Holy Spirit I'm talking about now.
    <br>"This is what the Bible says and what Prophet T.B. Joshua also mentioned last Sunday -
    <br>You have to speak to yourself with all your heart; speak to yourself – that is the biggest prayer."
    <br>Every other prayer is small.
    <br>The biggest prayer is to speak to your heart, take hold of your heart,
    <br>speak to yourself in Psalms, in hymns, make melodies while you are walking, sleeping, all the time.
    <br>Tthat is the greatest prayer that defeats the enemy, that will help you, that will protect you.
    <br>That is the prayer!
    <br>The one you make today waking up and saying, "In Jesus' name, be rebuked!" - whom are you talking to?
    <br>You are wasting your time.
    <br>You have seen enough of this prayer.
    <br>You can see that nothing...
    <br>Thank you, brother. Clap for him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is the best prayer to God?
    <br>Can somebody?
    <br>Give it to my brother.
    <br>The best prayer.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>The best prayer is the prayer that comes from the heart.
    <br>How can the prayer come from the heart?
    <br>When you are meditating on the Word of God in your heart, and your heart is connected with God,
    <br>that is the best prayer ever.
    <br>I have an example.
    <br>One day, when I was in the car, I was meditating on the Word of God.
    <br>I was in front of the vehicle between two people; the driver and the other one.
    <br>Whilst I was meditating on the Word of God, the driver shouted, "Hey!"
    <br>Then I shouted, "Jesus!"
    <br>Then I found myself outside, standing on my feet.
    <br>I don't know how I got there - I was standing outside, while the other people had broken bones.
    <br>They stayed in the car, they couldn't come out, the car somersaulted 3 times.
    <br>I thank God I shouted "Jesus!" before it happened - and I was standing outside.
    <br>But our people today shout "Jesus" after it happened.
    <br>I know you.
    <br>You shout "Jesus" after nightmare, trouble.
    <br>I want to leave you.
    <br>Once again - please, be filled.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to have your report; send me an e-mail and let me follow it up.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>This Bible you are carrying without the Holy Spirit is literature.
    <br>This Bible you are carrying without the Holy Spirit is history.
    <br>It’s not possible for anyone to obey the Word of God without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Not that you will not obey when you say, "Thou shalt not lie".
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit you say, "I will not lie again. T.B. Joshua said in his message we should not lie".
    <br>You will keep that for one day, two days, three days, four days;
    <br>on the fifth day you will become the greatest liar.
    <br>You will explode.
    <br>That is how far you can go.
    <br>But with God all things are possible.
    <br>But how far you can go; you keep saying "Thou shalt not lie" -
    <br>on the first day you will be conscious of yourself;
    <br>you want to lie but you are conscious of yourself, "The Bible says we should not lie".
    <br>The second day...
    <br>The third day...
    <br>What of you, drunkard?
    <br>You stop today, stop for five days...
    <br>In the dream they will give you to drink; you will finish 10 bottles of beer.
    <br>By the time you have taken it so much in your dream, you will wake up.
    <br>You are going to the beer parlour to drink.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, no one can obey the written Word of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, no one can obey the written Word of God.
    <br>Thank you.
