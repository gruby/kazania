    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday, July 6, 1997 Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke forth a prophetic message,
    <br>stating that a star, a popular person, would die.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>A star will fall.
    <br>By next Sunday, I will tell you the length of days.
    <br>Let us keep our fingers crossed.
    <br>One popular person will die.
    <br>There is nothing we can do about it.
    <br>I know that star. I know what will happen, and I know the day and time it will happen.
    <br>On Sunday, July 13, 1997 Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke further on this prophetic message,
    <br>stating that the popular person was a woman and that she would pass away in an overseas country.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>A popular person, a woman, will pass away in an overseas country.
    <br>I know where and I know the person.
    <br>People will condemn her because of what led to her death.
    <br>People will not like to hear it.
    <br>On Sunday, July 27, 1997 Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke a final time
    <br>regarding the popular woman who would die in an overseas country.
    <br>He then specifically stated her name.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>Three weeks ago - I want to remind you. This is an international issue.
    <br>Many of us were here when I asked people to pray - that, a star will fall,
    <br>a great star that will shake the whole world.
    <br>And it will come to pass.
    <br>And I told you she's a very young person.
    <br>The whole world will shake.
    <br>Is it Diana?
    <br>I will be here with you people. You will learn of what happened.
    <br>It's a disaster. It is not something that...
    <br>In the early hours of the morning, Sunday, August 31, 1997, news broke out around the world
    <br>that Diana, Princess of Wales, had just died.

    <br>Diana, Princess of Wales, has died.
    <br>The world has lost Princess Diana, age 36.

    <br>36-year-old Princess Diana and 42-year-old Dodi Al-Fayed, along with their driver,
    <br>were killed in the early morning hours in Paris
    <br>after apparently being chased at high speed by photographers on motorcycles.
    <br>Princess Diana was taken to a hospital where doctors tried to save her life.
    <br>They were unable to do that.
    <br>She died just about 1 1/2 hours ago.
    <br>It was announced that she died 2 hours earlier than that.
    <br>Apparently word was held as the sad news was passed on to (the family).
    <br>Prince Charles was staying with Prince William, the heir to the throne, and Prince Harry.
    <br>He is only 12 years old.
    <br>Prince William being 14 years of age.
    <br>This is the car in which they were riding.
    <br>It is a Mercedes Benz; it was a large vehicle.
    <br>It hit a concrete pillar at high speed at the Alma Bridge in Paris, along the Seine river.
    <br>It became clear that Princess Diana and Prince Charles were growing apart.
    <br>The newspapers would measure the days they spent separated.
    <br>A book "Diana: A True Story" by Andrew Morton revealed details of her unhappiness.
    <br>She had developed eating disorders and was even reported to have attempted suicide.
    <br>Eventually but out of the blue, the then-British Prime Minister John Major announced
    <br>that Diana and Charles would separate.
    <br>The British monarchy had not faced such a crisis since the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936.
    <br>But the Princess was not to be deterred from maintaining her high public profile.
    <br>Once the couple's divorce was confirmed and freed from the shackles of royal protocol,
    <br>she began to be seen in public with other men.
    <br>She focused her official life on several charities -
    <br>as varied as the Royal Ballet in London and the Red Cross campaign against landmines.
    <br>Within the past few months, she had been in Angola and Bosnia
    <br>to see at first hand the effect of landmines
    <br>as a guest of the International Red Cross -
    <br>a stand that caused political controversy.
    <br>She managed to combine her charitable work with a high-profile social calendar.
    <br>But it was her liason with Dodi Al-Fayed
    <br>that had seemed to be the most serious since the breakup of her marriage.
