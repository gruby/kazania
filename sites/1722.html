    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Man of God, please, deliver my wife.
    <br>She's not a prayer warrior; she went to pray for somebody.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>I went to pray for somebody; suddenly, the thing hit me.
    <br>Something hit me and since then, I've not been walking.
    <br>She says she is not a prophetess but she was moved to go and pray for somebody that was sick.
    <br>After praying for that person, the evil spirit left that person and entered her.
    <br>- Instantly?
    <br>- Yes, sir. She says she cannot walk.
    <br>What moved you to go and pray?
    <br>I followed someone to go and pray.
    <br>- You followed what?
    <br>- I followed someone to pray for her.
    <br>You followed your colleague to go and pray for people and the person was sick.
    <br>After you finished praying, the spirit entered you instantly.
    <br>What happened to the person happened to you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What moved you to pray for that person?
    <br>I followed my friend.
    <br>- Follow-follow.
    <br>- No, not like that, sir.
    <br>This follow-follow - what moved you?
    <br>Follow-follow, sir.
    <br>Follow, follow...
    <br>After praying for the person, the sickness of the person entered you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>- Instantly, you became sick.
    <br>- I cannot walk.
    <br>You could not walk, immediately.
    <br>- You remain crippled.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Look here!
    <br>This is Jesus - look there.
    <br>You see?
    <br>This is Jesus.
    <br>Stand up and go.
    <br>You see her walking.
    <br>I'm free.
    <br>I can walk now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can walk now.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mrs Marian Eze.
    <br>Next to me is my husband.
    <br>We are from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life.
    <br>One morning on February, I went to pray with a group of people.
    <br>The person was lying on the floor.
    <br>After praying we all left and I went back to my house.
    <br>On getting to my house, I went to my chair to sit.
    <br>Immediately I sat on that chair, something like thunder hit me on my back.
    <br>It ran fast like a snake and tied my neck.
    <br>It was so bad.
    <br>I was trying to stand up to make some noise but I passed out.
    <br>I don't know what I was doing, I don't even know how everything was going on in my life
    <br>since that February till last week, when my husband said we should come to The SCOAN.
    <br>From the moment we entered a bus till arriving here, I was not aware of anything.
    <br>My body was weak, my legs, my eyes, everything was just off.
    <br>They put me on the prayer line, I was prayed for by the man of God.
    <br>Immediately I was prayed for, I got instant healing.
    <br>Since February till last week, I didn't do anything.
    <br>He was the one taking care of the children, washing, cooking - everything was done by him.
    <br>Immediately that touch was on me, my healing came instantly.
    <br>LADY ATTACKED BY DEMON SHE TRIED TO CAST OUT!!!
    <br>Last week, after the prayer, we went back home.
    <br>I started doing my duties.
    <br>When we were told to come back this week,
    <br>I was the one taking care of him in the bus, not him taking care of me.
    <br>He was sleeping in the bus the whole journey here.
    <br>I thank God for everything.
    <br>I thank God for His mercy in my life, for restoring me back to normal.
    <br>LADY ATTACKED BY DEMON SHE TRIED TO CAST OUT!!!
    <br>Can you tell us the condition that woman was in,
    <br>when you got there, with the people you followed there to pray for the woman?
    <br>Her condition was very bad, she was lying helplessly on the floor, she couldn't do anything.
    <br>After we prayed, we left.
    <br>What now happened to you, when you got back home?
    <br>I went to my chair to sit.
    <br>When I sat on that chair, something hit me like a thunder
    <br>and it moved fast like a snake and tied my neck.
    <br>That was all I could remember.
    <br>That woman was lying helplessly on the floor.
    <br>- So you too became helpless?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- You could not do anything?
    <br>- I could not do anything since February till last week.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ?
    <br>Since the man of God prayed for you, how have you been feeling?
    <br>Fine. I am strong, I'm healthy now.
    <br>My advice is: If you are not blessed, if you are not strong, if you are not ordered by God,
    <br>don't do it, don't follow, stop following, as I have stopped following.
    <br>They should stop following, they should listen and hear from God first,
    <br>or be strong in God's Spirit, directed by God.
    <br>Don't move, don't follow, because you want to follow,
    <br>or don't follow because it is a group.
    <br>Be sure that you are committed by the Holy Spirit, sent by God and approved by God.
    <br>Then, you can.
    <br>My name is Mr Eze.
    <br>I am from Imo State.
    <br>My wife has already said all.
    <br>My advice is this:
    <br>These people following, praying anyhow, clapping, praying for people...
    <br>This my wife taught me a lesson.
    <br>I suffered, cooking like a woman, carrying her on my back everywhere.
    <br>To cross the road, I was carrying her like this.
    <br>This thing taught me a serious lesson.
    <br>Stop following people, stop praying anyhow.
    <br>Moving with the Holy Spirit...
    <br>When Holy Spirit directs you to go and pray for someone...
    <br>Because you don't know what spirits are inside of a person you are going to pray for -
    <br>whether there are thousands of spirits...
    <br>Stop praying, even clapping - stop clapping.
    <br>She is OK now.
    <br>She is very healthy and walking fine, she is very OK.
    <br>Also me - I am very OK.
    <br>I am delivered.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ?
