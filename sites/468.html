    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On the 6th August 2012,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy
    <br>concerning homeland security in the nation, America.
    <br>He called upon the congregation and viewers worldwide to pray for this nation,
    <br>stating that he saw the massacre that had happened in a theatre, continue.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>Pray for the nation, America.
    <br>That massacre that happened
    <br>in a theatre -
    <br>more is coming - more, more, more.
    <br>Pray for the nation.
    <br>This will continue.
    <br>This is homeland security.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
