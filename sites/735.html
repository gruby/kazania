  <p>    
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>You married through media - images.
    <br>That is your first attempt - somebody you have not seen physically.
    <br>Yes, it's true, man of God.
    <br>Just like on the internet.
    <br>It is true, man of God, very true.
    <br>Do you want me to talk to you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Someone you were not seeing - through internet, through chat.
    <br>You chatted and you decided to marry the person.
    <br>It' is true, man of God, it is true.
    <br>This is the beginning of where your life was destroyed.
    <br>Please deliver me, man of God.
    <br>You did not see - you just chatted and didn't even know the face,
    <br>whether they may send you a wrong face and you decided to marry the person.
    <br>That is how the marriage was established.
    <br>It is true, man of God; please deliver me, man of God.
    <br>Please deliver me.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Samahar Daniel.
    <br>I came from France.
    <br>I am originally Ethiopian.
    <br>What the man of God said last week is very true.
    <br>I was actually married through the internet when I was fifteen years old.
    <br>That is something that I have never ever shared in my life.
    <br>When I came here on Sunday, I was just sitting over there.
    <br>The man of God came to me as you saw and prophesied that straight to me.
    <br>I was really shocked and surprised
    <br>and very thankful to God that He has done this for me
    <br>because I was very hopeless.
    <br>When I got married to that internet relationship - 
    <br>as I told you I was fifteen years old...
    <br>After that, in the relationship that I had on the internet...
    <br>When I even used to date people or go out with some guys, I was never satisfied.
    <br>I mean the only thing that could satisfy me was having a relationship with an unknown person
    <br>that I had never seen in my entire life.
    <br>This problem led me to smoking, I used to go out and drink
    <br>when I was only fifteen and a half years old.
    <br>Every day someone around me would say, "When are you going to stop smoking?
    <br>When are you going to stop drinking?"
    <br>I used to take ecstasy, smoking cigarettes and 'weed' - 'weed' was every single day.
    <br>Each and every year, it got worse, worse and worse.
    <br>My mum sent me here for this issue last week.
    <br>When I came here I was very hopeless because whenever I used to go to church,
    <br>I used to tell the junior pastors to deliver me of my problems.
    <br>The next day I got to the church,
    <br>the pastor would come to me and prophesy everything I had told the junior pastors.
    <br>I was like, "No. God doesn't exist. It's not true, it cannot be true.
    <br>If I told someone what I was going through and he went to tell it to another person,
    <br>where was the proof that God is alive or works miracles?"
    <br>When I came to the The SCOAN last week and sat over there,
    <br>I said to myself, "Ok, now we are going to see".
    <br>But I really had hope that my life would change.
    <br>I was not a believer but I would still be like, "Please, Jesus, if you are alive, please help me.
    <br>I am struggling and I am tired of it".
    <br>Because my life depended on the things I took.
    <br>I fought with my parents; with my mum.
    <br>I got very aggressive, uncontrollable.
    <br>My breakfast was cigarettes and coffee.
    <br>That was the only thing that could calm my soul.
    <br>If I didn't get that, if I didn't smoke,
    <br>I would be very mad, so aggressive and very impolite.
    <br>Even on Sunday, when I was sitting over there,
    <br>every single minute I wanted to go out and smoke.
    <br>I was actually smoking. I smoked four cigarettes before coming to church.
    <br>Even when I was here, I was fighting with the ushers to let me go out and smoke.
    <br>That I didn't feel good, please.
    <br>When the man of God came and prophesied to me,
    <br>I said to myself, "Thank God! There is actually a true man of God in this world.
    <br>Not everyone is fooling people".
    <br>I was very happy; it was like a dream come through.
    <br>Immediately after that, people of God - I don't smoke anymore.
    <br>Miss Samahar Daniel
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!
    <br>Miss Samahar Daniel
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My parents used to take me to church but I never believed.
    <br>But my last experience really killed me.
    <br>I told myself that if God really existed, He would do something.
    <br>I would tell Him, "Why don't you do something? Please do something if you are here".
    <br>I came to The SCOAN with a lot of struggles.
    <br>My mum who pushed me to come here - there was even a time she was against it.
    <br>This was really meant to be. God really wanted to deliver me using the man of God.
    <br>Okay, now can you tell us what happened here that made you believe that God exists?
    <br>The prophesy was true because this was something I had never ever shared in my entire life.
    <br>This was the source of my problems.
    <br>This was the reason why I became who I was in the past.
    <br>And you didn't discuss this with anyone before coming here?
    <br>No! I had never told anyone.
    <br>Even for me - this was something that I had forgotten.
    <br>When the man of God said it, immediately I was like, "Ah! Yes! It was true!"
    <br>Whilst sitting on the seat, I was thinking about it.
    <br>In the night, I was thinking about it.
    <br>I had this flashback.
    <br>I remembered everything.
    <br>I started recollecting things.
    <br>God was showing me, "You see when I did this?"
    <br>Everything was so clear after that and so visible in my life.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Samahar Daniel
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Now, after having received a prophecy, that made you to believe that Jesus Christ exists -
    <br>the issue that you had never discussed with anyone -
    <br>what is your belief now about the existence of Jesus?
    <br>I had never found happiness in my entire life.
    <br>Wherever I went, whatever I did, I wasn't happy.
    <br>I used to go out, smoke, do every bad stuff.
    <br>But I had never been happy in my entire life.
    <br>And yes, I do believe now that God is really here and that He watches over us and protects us.
    <br>Because I have been through a lot of things, no matter how young I was.
    <br>I used to go out, drink and find myself with an unknown man.
    <br>And then I was like, "Samahar, why did you do that? What happened?"
    <br>And this was even unexplainable to myself.
    <br>I couldn't even explain it to myself.
    <br>So yes, God has protected me and my spiritual life since then has changed
    <br>because I would never stay five minutes in a church.
    <br>No matter where my mum took me, pastors coming to our home praying for me,
    <br>I would just go out to smoke my cigarettes and argue with everyone.
    <br>For the first time in my life, I attended a whole long service -
    <br>from the morning till the night!
    <br>And I pray and read the Bible.
    <br>I thank God!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!
    <br>Miss Samahar Daniel
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Now once again, because of how wonderful your testimony is,
    <br>and your testimony will go a long way to affect the youths all over the world positively...
    <br>Could you once again tell us, when you were addicted to this smoking and drinking,
    <br>how severe was it? How did it affect your entire life?
    <br>Could you tell us once again?
    <br>I think maybe people who have had an addiction before would understand what I'm exactly saying.
    <br>Because even not to eat breakfast is really hard.
    <br>When I got up in the morning, the only thing that I wanted to do
    <br>was just to light a cigarette and have a coffee.
    <br>Once, I even burnt my hair just trying to light a cigarette.
    <br>That was the only thing I wanted upon getting up.
    <br>When my parents were around, I couldn't smoke and I had to pretend that I was not a smoker.
    <br>Then, I would start a fight - I would become aggressive and find a reason to go out and smoke.
    <br>I could have never ever stopped.
    <br>I actually thought I would end up smoking.
    <br>Really, I would end up smoking.
    <br>Everyone in my family found out that I used to smoke 'weed' and cigarettes.
    <br>If it hadn't been for God, I would have never ever got out of the situation; that's for sure.
    <br>Miss Samahar Daniel
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Can you just tell us how this relationship you had on the internet affected your life,
    <br>in confirmation of the prophecy given by the man of God,
    <br>of which you said that you had never discussed it with anyone
    <br>and you were so shocked hearing that from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for the first time last Sunday.
    <br>Can you tell us how this relationship affected your life as a young lady?
    <br>It affected me in the sense that I was never happy with any relationship I had.
    <br>I preferred to have a person I had never met - through images only.
    <br>That gave me satisfaction.
    <br>The untouchable made me happy,
    <br>whilst I could have had someone I knew and went through life together.
    <br>But no - the unknown would make me happier.
    <br>It affected me in the sense that I was always unfaithful to the person I was with.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>After the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, gave you that message of prophecy
    <br>and you were delivered, what are the changes that have taken place in your life,
    <br>compared to your past life?
    <br>When I came here, I came on my own.
    <br>So I was staying in a hotel.
    <br>In my hotel room, I had two packets of cigarettes and one lighter.
    <br>While I was coming to The SCOAN to stay here, I left everything that I had.
    <br>And I was even surprised that I had somehow left everything in the truck.
    <br>It is incredible.
    <br>I was the type of person who would steal lighters from people. Believe me.
    <br>If a thrown-away packet of cigarettes was on the floor, I would check if there were cigarettes in it.
    <br>I would have never thought that I would leave forty cigarettes behind.
    <br>And I am still not smoking.
    <br>I will never smoke again. I thank God.
    <br>You mean the urge to smoke and drink is completely gone after the deliverance?
    <br>Gone - 100%.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ for that!
    <br>Miss Samahar Daniel
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Finally, as a young lady who has experienced a lot in the world,
    <br>before Jesus Christ rescued you from the shackles of satan,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people around the world,
    <br>especially for the youth who are already into such a trap?
    <br>What do you advise them to do?
    <br>My advice would be to come to Jesus Christ
    <br>because you can never come out of this situation on your own.
    <br>I tried everything to stop; I was even in rehab back in France.
    <br>This is something that human beings cannot heal.
    <br>It is only through God. So please come to Jesus.
    <br>He has the solution for everything.
    <br>Indeed, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is the solution to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>Having experienced that the Lord is good,
    <br>we beseech you to continue your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>and we pray that as you continue your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>always have it at the back of your mind that
    <br>better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.
    <br>Let us clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
