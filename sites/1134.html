    <br>Now, let’s look for peace – the little you have will be sufficient.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Look for peace – peace of heart – the little you have will be sufficient”.
    <br>Without peace, if you have the whole world, you are in trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again, “Look for peace – peace of heart – the little, the atom you have will be sufficient”.
    <br>Without the peace of heart, if you have the whole world, you will have trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That will be the summary of my message.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning, you are looking, you want to be great, rich - you are looking for money,
    <br>business - you are ready to do anything to get it.
    <br>Anything to get cannot give you a peace of heart.
    <br>The only thing that will give you peace of heart is to consider your neighbour
    <br>while looking for your own.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>“The only thing that will give you peace of heart is to consider your neighbour
    <br>while looking for your way out”.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you don’t consider your neighbour while looking for the way out of your problem,
    <br>you have not considered Jesus, your Creator.
    <br>Remember, your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Once again,
    <br>the only way you can have that peace of heart is to always consider your neighbour,
    <br>while searching for the way out.
    <br>Your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Your neighbour can be your enemy.
    <br>Your neighbour can be your friend.
    <br>While looking for the way out of your mess, difficulties, whatever situation you have;
    <br>when you are looking for a way, "How will I get this business done? I'm poor. I want to apply for a business.",
    <br>consider your neighbour.
    <br>What has happened to your neighbour?
    <br>If your neighbour is entitled to the same business, and you want to take it by any mean -
    <br>you want to do anything to take that business,
    <br>and you know your neighbour is the best for that business, but you have a way of taking it,
    <br>you continue to take it - no peace of heart.
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>While looking for a way out, always consider your neighbour.
    <br>Your neighbour can be your friend, your enemy, can be those who do not share the same faith with you -
    <br>consider them!
    <br>Do you know the reason why you have to consider your neighbour,
    <br>those who do not share the same faith with you?
    <br>Your enemy today may be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>It may be the one to take you to the promised land - your greatest enemy today.
    <br>Your greatest enemy, that wants you to die, that is after your life, is the number one enemy today,
    <br>may be your saviour any moment from now,
    <br>and will be the one to take you to the promised land.
    <br>I take it back again.
    <br>While looking for a way out, consider your neighbour.
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Wish your neighbour as you wish yourself.
    <br>Stop that your prayer; you want to kill your enemy...
    <br>If you say you want to kill your enemy...
    <br>You know, you were once an enemy to someone else before, and you were not killed.
    <br>But today, you want to kill your enemy.
    <br>And that person who is your enemy - he wants to kill you in the same way you want to kill him.
    <br>You are wasting your time, killing your enemy, when the Lord said,
    <br>"I will set a table before you, in the presence of your enemy".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are wasting your time.
    <br>Because the Lord said, "I will set a table before you, in the presence of your who"?
    <br>If you have killed them, who will be there to see your goodness?
    <br>Who will testify to your goodness?
    <br>Look at you - 99% of people here today were once my enemies who wanted to kill me.
    <br>You were fasting, praying, binding me and loosing at the same time.
    <br>In the past, 90% of people sitting here today;
    <br>anytime they saw Emmanuel TV, "Please! Switch it off. Over my dead body, I will come to that church.",
    <br>but your real  body is here today, because you are not killed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you are not killed...
    <br>Don't waste your time - I don't waste my time, because I know where I'm going.
    <br>Because we don't know where we are going.
    <br>If you knew where you are going, you will not waste your time over your enemy;
    <br>no enemy can stop you from where you are going.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you believe they can stop you, that is why you want to stop them - no!
    <br>Do and let me do - your life is just...
    <br>Please; there are many things we need to know that will guide us.
    <br>When you want to pray, ask for God's mercy and His favour, and thank Him,
    <br>and let Him know that here you are.
    <br>If you want someone, He should send you and leave that prayer.
    <br>Stop wasting your time over your enemy.
    <br>For how long?
    <br>I want to leave you - please, take this message.
