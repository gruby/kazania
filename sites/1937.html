  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with us, who can be against us?
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>Today we have "You are a faith man".
    <br>The proof text shall be taken from Ephesians 2:8,
    <br>"For by grace you have been saved through faith,
    <br>and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."
    <br>Let someone say, "I am a faith man."
    <br>This means we are all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>We are all children of God by faith in Christ.
    <br>Climbing a mountain is a picture of the life of faith.
    <br>Throughout our lives, we are to continue moving upward.
    <br>Faith in us grows stronger as we climb higher.
    <br>You can be bold in your Christian life
    <br>through knowing you are a faith man.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You can be bold in your Christian life through knowing you are a faith man,
    <br>through knowing you are a faith woman."
    <br>Someone will say, "Ah, this is too much for me."
    <br>What is too much for you,
    <br>when the persecution we suffer in the hands of our detractors
    <br>causes us to be known all over the world?
    <br>The more the intimidation, the more the persecution, the more the name-calling,
    <br>the more you are strong in the Lord.
    <br>1 Peter 2:9.
    <br>Our language becomes like that of 'Super men'.
    <br>"Yes, I am telling you, I am a child of God. I am redeemed. I am born again.
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past. I am linked up with God."
    <br>We talk as the people of another race.
    <br>We talk as people of another Kingdom.
    <br>We are here, we live in the world but we are not part of them.
    <br>That is why we talk as people of another race, another Kingdom.
    <br>Here is not our home; we are just passing through.
    <br>We have authority; God is supporting our position.
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>We are bold to speak our Father's language
    <br>as commonly as the unbeliever talks of his fear.
    <br>The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Old things pass away..."
    <br>That is all things become new.
    <br>Old things are gone.
    <br>Sickness, disease, frustration - those foolish things are passed away.
    <br>We have God's nature, His glory, His power, His majesty.
    <br>The name Jesus has power indeed -
    <br>only those who are committed to His glory.
    <br>If you are not committed to His glory and you are calling His name,
    <br>you are wasting your time.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of Romans 1:17.
    <br>"For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith;
    <br>as it is written, 'The just shall live by faith.' "
    <br>What a blessing to know for sure that no matter how you feel,
    <br>God says that faith is something you already have.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter how I feel..."
    <br>What do I mean by, "No matter how I feel"?
    <br>A man may be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>You can be sick in body and yet be a favourite, a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>When the rich sees the poor, he says, "Look at this man - it is as a result of his sin."
    <br>When those who are in good health see the sick one, they say, "He has committed sin."
    <br>Jesus says that faith is something I already have.
    <br>It is a gift of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You must not concentrate on your situation.
    <br>If you want to serve God in truth and Spirit, you must not concentrate on your poverty,
    <br>you must not concentrate on your sickness.
    <br>Because a man may be poor and yet be a candidate of Heaven."
    <br>Open the Book of Galatians 3:26.
    <br>"For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus."
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>God has given you the measure of faith.
    <br>Notice:
    <br>Not just a measure of faith but the measure of faith.
    <br>God has given you.
    <br>Not how small your faith is...
    <br>The quantity of faith is not what is important with Jesus.
    <br>The Word of God shall be the basis of our faith.
    <br>Our looking unto the promise of God
    <br>is a good reason for looking to God for mercy, for favour,
    <br>for deliverance, for healing, for salvation.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Then, there is no time to stop looking until God withdraws His Word.
    <br>My faith looks up to Thee
    <br>Thou Lamb of Calvary
    <br>Saviour divine
    <br>Now hear me while I pray
    <br>Take all my guilt away
    <br>O let me from this day
    <br>Be wholly Thine
    <br>My faith looks up to Thee
    <br>Thou Lamb of Calvary
    <br>Saviour divine
    <br>Now hear me while I pray
    <br>Take all my guilt away
    <br>O let me from this day
    <br>Be wholly Thine
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Come unto me all ye that what?
    <br>He says, "Let the weak say... Let the poor say... Let the sick say..."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Our looking unto the promise of the Father
    <br>is a good reason for looking to God for mercy, deliverance, salvation, redemption;
    <br>then, there is no time to stop looking
    <br>until God withdraws His Word."
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>The reason for faith is as good as God's Word.
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>Because that trouble you have may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>If you are asking God to heal you, you are just disturbing yourself.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to preserve you.
    <br>It may be to prepare you, to strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>It may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>It may be...
    <br>Who knows what would have happened
    <br>if your prayer for a better condition had been answered?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Who knows what would have happened
    <br>if your prayer for a better condition had been answered?"
    <br>"In the name of Jesus... I want to move this mountain."
    <br>But the mountain is still there.
    <br>If I stand and say, "Whether God heals me or not, He is my Healer.
    <br>Whether God delivers me or not, He is my Deliverer. Whether God..."
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>You say, "I need healing. I have a headache."
    <br>After prayer the headache still persists.
    <br>Whether God heals you or not, He is the Healer.
    <br>Whether God blesses you or not,
    <br>whether God delivers you or not, He is my Deliverer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It honours Him to believe Him even while every sense contradicts Him."
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>It honours Him to believe Him even while every sense contradicts Him
    <br>and God also honours those who honour Him.
    <br>If I believe that God is my Healer,
    <br>I should have confidence in His ability to heal.
    <br>To learn how to hear God after prayer
    <br>is a much greater blessing than is the healing.
    <br>When you are poor and anxiously in need of blessing,
    <br>you will not mind the source that supplies that blessing.
    <br>To learn how to hear from above after prayer
    <br>is a much greater blessing than what you are looking for.
    <br>You are looking for blessing, healing...
    <br>You have not discovered this because the prayer of faith can be repeated 10 000 times.
    <br>Look at what happened to Paul Apostle.
    <br>He came to God, "God, there is a thorn in my flesh."
    <br>The Lord said, "Go and sit down" because he heard from God.
    <br>Assume he did not, it might go another way.
    <br>He heard from God - the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you."
    <br>He said, "OK, thank You."
    <br>The second time, he went again.
    <br>God said, "My grace is sufficient for you."
    <br>That encouraged him to wait patiently.
    <br>But, do you hear from God?
    <br>Have you ever heard from God?
    <br>You keep receiving healing, blessing, deliverance - do you ever hear from God?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "To learn how to hear after prayer
    <br>is a much greater blessing than..."
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>That makes you a man of faith.
    <br>It is not the blessing you receive.
    <br>I told you at the beginning it is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>"Ah, Jesus Christ, I am sick. Heal me."
    <br>At the end of the day, the sickness continues.
    <br>You say, "No. I don't have faith. That is why I don't receive."
    <br>No!
    <br>It may be to preserve you.
    <br>It may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It may be to keep you for a new level.
    <br>It may be to strengthen your...
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>They are not coming from God, they are from the adversary,
    <br>but God often uses foolish things.
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Learning how to hear from God after prayer
    <br>is a much greater blessing, healing, deliverance than what you are looking for!"
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>When you look at what the Bible says in the Book of Ephesians 2:8,
    <br>"For by grace you have been saved through faith."
    <br>And I told you from the beginning that the Word of God shall be the basis of our faith.
    <br>To appropriate faith:
    <br>Simply believe the Word of God that God will do exactly as He promised.
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>The Word of God says, "Let the sick say I am healed" - you are healed already.
    <br>It is a past-tense healing.
    <br>What you are looking for is a past-tense victory.
    <br>Be fully persuaded by the Word of God alone,
    <br>not what you hear, what you see, what your situation looks like.
    <br>What you need today is to hold fast to your confidence in God's Word
    <br>when your faith is tested.
    <br>Hold fast to your confidence in God's Word.
    <br>What is your confidence is God's Word?
    <br>My confidence is God's Word: Jesus is the Redeemer, whether He redeems me or not.
    <br>Jesus is the Deliverer, whether he delivers me or not.
    <br>That is my confidence.
    <br>YOU ARE A FAITH MAN!!! | TB Joshua Sermon (2009)
    <br>I have come to say how much I love You
    <br>I have come to say how much I adore You
    <br>Lord I am not here to complain
    <br>About my many problems
    <br>By Your Spirit and Your grace
    <br>I am confident You will solve them
    <br>I am here to say I love You
    <br>I am here to say I adore You
    <br>I am here to say I love You
    <br>I love to love You Lord
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I believe we have landed.
    <br>Yes, you are now at the airport to collect your luggage.
    <br>That luggage is full of blessings.
    <br>Our language becomes like that of super men.
    <br>"Yes, I am telling you, I am a child of God. I am redeemed. I am born again.
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past. I am linked up with God"
    <br>We talk as the people of another race.
    <br>We talk as people of another Kingdom.
    <br>We are here; we live in the world but we are not a part of them -
    <br>that is why we talk as people of another race, another Kingdom.
    <br>What a blessing to know for sure that no matter how you feel,
    <br>God says, faith is something you already have.
    <br>A man may be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>You can be sick in body and yet be a favourite, a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>When the rich sees the poor, he says, "Look at this man - it is as a result of his sin."
