  <p>    
    <br>During the mass prayer, while Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying,
    <br>he noticed a lady of short stature, praying among the congregation.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>What are you doing for a living?
    <br>I am a student, 300 level.
    <br>300 level?
    <br>University of where?

    <br>The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>So, you study what?
    <br>Computer Science.
    <br>I want to be your friend.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>I want to be your friend.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Is there any way we can be of help?
    <br>The area I need your assistance, if you can assist me, immediately I finish school,
    <br>I don’t want to rely on somebody; I want to have something to do.
    <br>OK, when you finish the university, you want to have something to do?
    <br>So, you don't want to be looking for a job?
    <br>OK, don't worry.
    <br>We will make sure, we get you established. OK?
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>People that believe they are tall, they will come to you and ask you for help.
    <br>The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Where is your friend?
    <br>Stepping forward is the friend the lady mentioned to the man of God.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Let them sit down.
    <br>The two friends sit down together on one chair.
    <br>Look for those who need you most.
    <br>No matter how small...
    <br>Many are out there in need of what you have.
    <br>Look for them.
    <br>Tell you neighbour: "Look for them".
    <br>Moved with compassion, Prophet T.B. Joshua invited the two friends
    <br>to come back to The SCOAN the next day,
    <br>interested to know more about their plight, and how he can be of assistance to them.
    <br>Let's hear what they have to say.
    <br>My name is Ehizua Christiana.
    <br>I am from Edo State.
    <br>I attended Ambrose University, Ekpoma. I studied Political Science Education.
    <br>I finished in 2007/2008 and I served 2008/2009.
    <br>The person next to me is Evelyn Cosey Otekpe.
    <br>She is 27 years old. She is a student of Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma,
    <br>studying Computer Science.
    <br>I met her 4 years ago when I was in school.
    <br>I saw her and I asked her, “What is happening?”
    <br>She said that she did not see anybody that would pick her up; that is why she was crying.
    <br>She didn’t have anyone.
    <br>Who was crying?
    <br>My good friend Evelyn.
    <br>She was crying
    <br>and when she was shedding tears, I said: “Don’t worry; I will be with you.
    <br>I promise to be with you till death does us part”.
    <br>And since then, I’ve been with her, doing all things for her -
    <br>fetching water for her, buying food, washing clothes.
    <br>Whenever it is difficult, she would call me and I would be there for her.
    <br>To fetch water from the stream - I would do everything for her.
    <br>Even right now, she’s staying with my parents.
    <br>She was rejected because many people drive her away; they don't like to see her.
    <br>That is why she has nobody to help her.
    <br>What actually drew your attention to this sister?
    <br>Any time I wash her clothes, I feel joy.
    <br>Anywhere I go, we go together.
    <br>If she has anything she wants to do, she will call me.
    <br>I make her happy.
    <br>If we are going out, I will ‘back her’.
    <br>Tell us the reason for which you 'back her'.
    <br>She finds it difficult to walk long distances.
    <br>That is why you 'back her' while you are moving together?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Even now, I’m looking for a job – it’s not easy. Because if I had a good job now,
    <br>I would have the opportunity to take care of her very well.
    <br>She prays for me. Sometimes, if I’m not around or if I forget to pray,
    <br>she is the one that will pray for me.
    <br>She even helps me to write prayer requests.
    <br>Sometimes, she would just ask what my problem was.
    <br>I would tell her.
    <br>She would say, "Do not worry". She would fast for me, pray for me.
    <br>She would say, "God will see you through".
    <br>Can you explain to us how you and your friend got to know about the SCOAN?
    <br>We watch Emmanuel TV to see what Prophet T.B. Joshua is doing -
    <br>encouraging people, playing with them, the less privileged,
    <br>the disabled, the handicapped – he’s there for them.
    <br>That is why she said, “Christy, we must visit The Synagogue”.
    <br>I said, “OK, I will come with you”. That is why we came to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When we came, it was so difficult for us to enter the church.
    <br>We were together on Sunday morning.
    <br>The ushers saw her. They said that she should go to the children’s department.
    <br>She is 27 years old. She cannot go to the children's department.
    <br>She is a student at the university. I was shouting.
    <br>It was so difficult.
    <br>I’m happy the man of God discovered her because it is not easy.
    <br>I’m here because of my friend and I know that God will use the man of God to help us in our need.
    <br>Can you tell us your name, your age, and where you come from?
    <br>Cosy Evelyn Otekpe. I am 27 years old.
    <br>I’m from Edo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I attend Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma, Edo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I study Computer Science. I’m now in my final year.
    <br>What do you have to say about what your friend has said?
    <br>My friend has said everything.
    <br>I thank God for giving me such a wonderful friend.
    <br>Life was very horrible for me because people reject me.
    <br>Before I could get a bike or a bus, I would spend an hour before somebody would come and help me.
    <br>But since I met her, she charters buses.
    <br>People see me and run away.
    <br>Some pick on me and try to mock me, saying:
    <br>"Can you see somebody like this?" or: "Where is this one from?"
    <br>But since I met her, she has been doing all these jobs -
    <br>helping me to get a bike, chartering a bus for me, fetching water for me
    <br>helping me to wash clothes - because I cannot trek long distances.
    <br>If not because of her, life would have been miserable for me.
    <br>Ever since I met her, God has used her in a wonderful way.
    <br>At times, she washes my clothes,
    <br>she backs me because I cannot walk long distances, she gives me encouragement.
    <br>At times, when I think ‘It’s all over’, she makes me realise that there is still hope.
    <br>There is not much more to say.
    <br>All I have to say is that I give glory to God
    <br>for giving me a friend who is so caring like this.
    <br>I thank God for everything.
    <br>I watch Emmanuel TV in my friend’s house.
    <br>I saw the way Pastor T.B. Joshua takes care of the physically challenged -
    <br>giving them money and sending them to school.
    <br>Because of that, I had the belief that, by the time I see him, God will use him to meet all my needs.
    <br>Ever since then, I’ve been forcing my friend to take me to The SCOAN.
    <br>During the second service, God did it for me and I was able to see Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>But now I’ve seen him, I want God to use him to help me, right from now 'til I finish my school.
    <br>I want God to use him to establish me.
    <br>I want Pastor T.B. Joshua to help my friend.
    <br>I want to tell you today that Jesus values our little effort to honour Him when it is done in humility and faith.
    <br>Some people complain that there is no job after your education.
    <br>There are jobs; this is God’s job.
    <br>When you do this for one or two years, God will provide for you.
    <br>Take this challenge and see what God will do for you.
    <br>Let them come forward.
    <br>This sister needs to be established.
    <br>Together the two friends move forward to meet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You know I told you, you are my best friend.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Well, I want to congratulate you. Thank you very much.
    <br>The Lord said to me that He wants to use this sister as a good example to the whole world.
    <br>This is God’s job.
    <br>The Lord said I should give you a car
    <br>and also give you 500 000 Naira.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>No no, it is God.
    <br>I'm just a servant.
    <br>Give them the key.
    <br>The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>There is the key of the car being handed over.
    <br>The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team presents the cash gift of 500 000 Naira to the two friends.
    <br>Watch your screen - 500 000 Naira, cash.
    <br>There is a brand new car
    <br>just outside the church auditorium here.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua blessed them with a sum of 500 000 Naira and a brand new car.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Viewers, we wish to encourage you to do the same.
    <br>See your life as a solution to someone in trouble, and look for those who need you the most.
    <br>Emmanuel - God is with us.
    <br>We are communicating, telling you – do the same.
    <br>There are many little people in Africa here.
    <br>They are suffering.
    <br>They suffer rejection, isolation.
    <br>In Africa.
    <br>Why can you not walk in public?
    <br>Because of the rejection and intimidation.
    <br>So, thank you, sister.
    <br>I just need to thank you.
    <br>OK?
    <br>You are a part of our family.
    <br>We want to follow it up.
    <br>You will come here for holiday, we are one. OK?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Can I give you a kiss please?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Having received a cash gift of 500 000 Naira, a new car, and a promise of a lasting relationship,
    <br>the two friends, Miss Evelyn and Christiana, outside of the church auditorium cross the road
    <br>to see their beautiful new car.
    <br>Taking the key, Mrs Christiana unlocks the door, and helps her friend Evelyn to climb inside,
    <br>before she gets into the driver's seat.
    <br>Joyfully, the two friends Evelyn and Christiana wave from inside their brand new car.
    <br>What a life-changing encounter.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I have never dreamt of this. We give God the glory.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>You heard it from the lady, giving thanks to God Almighty for this unexpected gift.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Ehizua Christiana. We are from Edo state.
    <br>The persons standing beside me are her mother, her elder sister, and our in-law.
    <br>Can you just tell the viewers, especially those who were not watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>what actually happened in the church here, the day you were blessed?
    <br>We received a car, N500 000 and six bags of rice.
    <br>This is the Bible and N500 000.
    <br>It was for you and your friend?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>My name is Cosy Evelyn Otekpe. I am from Edo State.
    <br>A student of Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma, Edo State.
    <br>Studying what? And at which year are you?
    <br>Computer Science, final year.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my mother.
    <br>This is my wonderful elder sister, Christy's in-law and this is my wonderful friend.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua blessed us with a gift of a car, N500 000 and also six bags of rice.
    <br>These are the particulars of the car.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>Let's hear from your mother first.
    <br>My name is Agnes Oriwo. I'm 60 years of age.
    <br>I came from Edo State because of this little girl, my daughter.
    <br>I love her; she’s a clever girl.
    <br>Her father sued me to court and we divorced 13 years ago.
    <br>What happened was that he said: “I have one child who is not normal.”
    <br>Which child is that?
    <br>My daughter.
    <br>You mean that your husband was referring to your daughter Evelyn?
    <br>... that I have one that is not normal.
    <br>I wanted to faint but my mother held me and said: "Don't worry, things will be OK."
    <br>For the next three days, I didn’t eat anything.
    <br>After some time, they organized a church in my room.
    <br>Later, she joined the Redeemed Church and became a coordinator of children.
    <br>After that, she went outside preaching the Word of God.
    <br>I don’t know how to thank the man of God.
    <br>She is a burden to me; I don’t know what to say.
    <br>She is the one that encourages me and says that whatever a tall person can do, she can also do it.
    <br>On Sunday, I saw my daughter on Emmanuel TV and I started crying.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua held my daughter and I said: "Ah, my daughter that was rejected!"
    <br>He held my daughter and asked her whether she wanted to be his friend.
    <br>I started crying. I didn’t know what to say or what to do.
    <br>I give God the glory; I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for my daughter’s life.
    <br>I didn’t expect that a man of God could do this.
    <br>OK, you can see the mother... Don't worry, mama.
    <br>It is a thing of joy.
    <br>I don't know what to say.
    <br>I give God the glory.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done in our life.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave her N500 000, a car, six bags of rice and a Bible.
    <br>I was surprised.
    <br>I feel very happy.
    <br>That day I did not sleep, it was like I was dreaming.
    <br>And now, that the Lord has located you and blessed your daughter
    <br>- what word of advice do you have for parents like you
    <br>who also have children like this, of this stature and they are underrating what God can do in their life?
    <br>They should look up to God; there is no other way.
    <br>It’s God’s work. What a man cannot do, God will do it.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>That is why God used Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua to do this kind of job.
    <br>I give God the glory.
    <br>Don't cry.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done, and I believe these are just tears of joy you are shedding,
    <br>because at the end of the da,y God has blessed your daughter abundantly.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I am Christy Kiaham from Abuja.
    <br>This is my mummy, my younger sister. I’m the second born of my mummy.
    <br>My mummy has been the one taking care of us.
    <br>The REAL Meaning of FRIENDSHIP – TB Joshua
    <br>When I am at home, I do assist her, we go to the village market
    <br>to sell ice-cream to assist her for my brothers' and sisters' school fees.
    <br>During the mass prayer, my prayer point was: ‘God, locate Evelyn.’
    <br>Behold – after few seconds, the man of God located her.
    <br>I was rejoicing because I believed that all the problems we were facing had been solved.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, the man of God called her and said: "I want to be your friend",
    <br>I was crying. It was a thing of joy.
    <br>I didn’t expect this. Among thousands for the man of God to locate somebody like this
    <br>- it was a great joy.
    <br>I thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>May God bless him and his family and the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>She was given with her friend a brand new car, N500 000, six bags of rice and a Bible.
    <br>My heart was full of joy.
    <br>God, I thank You for using the man of God to locate my sister, to bless my sister.
    <br>God, I give You all the glory, honour, I adore You.
    <br>There is no one like You.
    <br>Despite her stature, the man of God received her as his daughter.
    <br>I want to advise people all over the world, don’t lose hope.
    <br>No matter your stature – believe in God.
    <br>Pray.
    <br>As God located my sister, He will surely locate you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Okweki Lucky. I’m from Edo State.
    <br>I married the immediate senior sister to Christy here.
    <br>Four years ago, Christy brought this girl to our house, and introduced her to be her friend.
    <br>Instead of rejecting her, we accepted her to our family,
    <br>and ever since, she has been a source of joy to our family.
    <br>Last Sunday I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was so surprised to see the man of God calling this girl out.
    <br>Later I saw that the man of God presented a gift of N500 000 to them,
    <br>a brand new car and six bags of rice.
    <br>We were rejoicing over there in Edo State.
    <br>That is why we came to rejoice with them.
    <br>Yes, we thank God Almighty for everything.
    <br>We also thank you so much for taking time out of your tight schedule to come here
    <br>to show appreciation to God Almighty, for what God has used the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>to do in the life of your sister-in-law, and your sister-in-law's friend,
    <br>and of course your sister-in-law's friend family.
    <br>We also want to let you know that of course, it is the work of God,
    <br>and God does as He wills and of course, God's time is the best.
    <br>The moment God Almighty locates you, even in your trouble, your trouble will turn to solution.
    <br>That happened in the life of our two friends here.
    <br>We also believe that God will extend it to lives of others.
    <br>We want to encourage our friends here to continue their relationship,
    <br>which has been founded upon the Rock of Ages.
    <br>This kind of friendship is a type of friendship that Jesus Christ is looking for to bless them,
    <br>to cement the relationship the more.
    <br>We pray that the joy of the Lord that has actually commenced in this family
    <br>will continue to reign, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can we just hear a wonderful song from someone after this really wonderful testimony?
