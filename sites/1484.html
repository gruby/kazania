  <p>    
    <br>My name is Mrs Jubili Umevere.
    <br>These kids are my kids.
    <br>This man behind me is my husband and this is my younger sister, Mrs Blessing Obarhua.
    <br>This man beside her is her husband, Mr Anthony Obarhua.
    <br>These are her husband's parents and this man here is my elder brother, Mr Peter Anighoror.
    <br>This is my in-law's elder brother and this is his younger brother.
    <br>This is my younger sister, Ediri Anighoror.
    <br>This is my younger brother, Samson Anighoror.
    <br>Last year, December, when we were about to celebrate our marriage,
    <br>we started experiencing different things until we moved out of our home.
    <br>We have no job, no apartment, no accommodation so I moved to my younger sister's place.
    <br>I was living with her.
    <br>One day, my boy Destiny started screaming at night.
    <br>In the morning we asked him, "Destiny what happened in the night?"
    <br>He said, "It is my elder sister, Angela."
    <br>That my daughter, Angela is taking him to a satanic kingdom.
    <br>That they are the people that are behind all our problems.
    <br>That we will never know peace and they collected my younger sister's womb
    <br>and my in-law's sperm also.
    <br>My sister said we cannot stay with her and we moved from there.
    <br>They said their father will never have a job and we will never have an apartment.
    <br>So with that annoyance their father went and bought acid,
    <br>that he was going to poison the two of them and kill them.
    <br>She started crying that they should bring her to T.B. Joshua that he is the man that will deliver them.
    <br>So we came here.
    <br>My name is Angela Frank.
    <br>When my mother gave birth to my younger brother Favour,
    <br>my mother's senior sister gave me money that I should use it to buy something.
    <br>Every night she comes to carry me to their kingdom.
    <br>When I grew up, I used to go by myself and she told me to initiate my brother
    <br>and I initiated my brother.
    <br>Which brother did you initiate?
    <br>This one you initiated?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What did you people used to do?
    <br>They said when I was eating something, I should call him.
    <br>They told me that I should take my aunty's womb and my aunty's husband -
    <br>I use this sperm to make yogurt.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>What happened to your aunty's womb?
    <br>She has no womb.
    <br>I took her womb to their kingdom.
    <br>What other things did you take there?
    <br>My mummy and daddy have no apartment; they are jobless and they don't have any house to stay.
    <br>Anywhere they go, they always drive them from there.
    <br>I see this my uncle's father in their kingdom.
    <br>And I see this my...
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>They are here - we must listen to their complaint.
    <br>When we hear everything, then - what God says about the matter.
    <br>So let's listen.
    <br>Don't let anything to be too much for you to hear.
    <br>I used to see this woman in their kingdom.
    <br>- Which woman?
    <br>- This woman.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>- You say what?
    <br>- This woman.
    <br>Can we hear from mama?
    <br>Why mama is doing this?
    <br>Mama, what happened?
    <br>She says she used to see you.
    <br>I don't know anything about being a witch.
    <br>What is that thing you are carrying?
    <br>This is acid.
    <br>- Acid?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>What for?
    <br>When my children were confessing that they are the cause of all the problems in my life,
    <br>they frustrated me.
    <br>That is why we don't have a house to stay in.
    <br>Then I bought this acid to kill them.
    <br>My name is Mrs Blessing Obarhua.
    <br>I am from Delta State.
    <br>For the past three years that we've been married - no issue.
    <br>Whenever my husband wants to sleep with me, his manhood would not stand.
    <br>Each time, I kept on complaining.
    <br>I met his mother, I told her.
    <br>This is the mother.
    <br>- Which mother?
    <br>- The mother of my husband.
    <br>This is my husband, Mr Anthony Obarhua.
    <br>My name is Mr Anthony Obarhua.
    <br>I am from Delta State.
    <br>Since I got married in 2007 on 17th May, things started getting difficult for me.
    <br>I took my parents to a witch doctor and the woman asked me what my problem was.
    <br>I said that I suspect that my father is a wizard.
    <br>She said my problems are from the two of them.
    <br>That my mother and father are the problems of my life.
    <br>The home is in disarray.
    <br>And my father accepted that he is a wizard.
    <br>He said he was a wizard.
    <br>After the witch doctor asked, "Are you not a wizard?",
    <br>he accepted that he was a wizard.
    <br>OK.
    <br>I hope you will listen to me now.
    <br>- Are you ready to hear the voice of God?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Let me start from the little girl.
    <br>Little girl, come.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>She is not a witch.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>Even though she stood here to tell me she is a witch - she is not a witch.
    <br>Because I could not see any traces of darkness there.
    <br>Do you know what has happened?
    <br>There is someone, somewhere who is using the image of this little girl
    <br>to perpetrate evil so that they will destroy this girl.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>So if that one is not a witch, the person to claim to give the power has no power,
    <br>definitely, we are wasting our time.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>Brother, your father is not a wizard.
    <br>Your mother is not a witch.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>The Lord is good.
    <br>Baba does not know the meaning of 'wizard'.
    <br>He sees is it as a reason for pride.
    <br>He doesn't know the meaning.
    <br>He just claims he is a wizard; he is not a wizard, he doesn't know the meaning.
    <br>You know in this village they boast, "I'm a wizard now"...
    <br>There is nothing like that.
    <br>Mama is not a witch, baba is not a wizard, the children are not witches.
    <br>When they bring 100 people here, hardly, through the Holy Ghost, will you be able to see
    <br>two or three that are real witches and wizards.
    <br>All others are falsehood.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>I am not a witch.
    <br>Lady, you will have your child.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Father, thank You.
    <br>Baba, you have to forgive and forget whatever name they called you.
    <br>Because this story, the whole thing come from the kingdom of falsehood.
    <br>So please, forget and forgive, and hug your son.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>I will forgive them.
    <br>Having forgiven his children, their grandfather cries out,
    <br>having realised the gravity of the accusation that was leveled against him for so many years
    <br>and he weeps in relief that the Lord, God Almighty has vindicated him
    <br>and reconciled his broken home.
    <br>Baba is crying.
    <br>Is This Cute Little Girl Really A WITCH?!? ðŸ˜­
    <br>Thank you man of God.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>You are a good man to us.
    <br>We are not all those names they gave to us.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>And the baba is getting old, and he doesn't know what to do.
    <br>This is how the baba would have died.
    <br>Many of us that claim that our mum, sister, whoever you call 'witch' or 'wizard',
    <br>whatever name you call them,
    <br>the moment you begin to maltreat them, in whichever way,
    <br>whether you try to deal with them by punishing them,
    <br>you are also possessing the same spirit,
    <br>because it is not human.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>The second family that was reconciled in Christ Jesus during the Sunday Service
    <br>also came together to tell of their experiences,
    <br>to thank God for the fresh beginning they received,
    <br>and to testify of how out of misunderstanding God Almighty has brought greater understanding.
    <br>I thank God that He has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to reconcile my family.
    <br>If not for him, the family would have torn apart but I thank God
    <br>that we have settled together; we have become one again.
    <br>Not only did the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua vindicate and reconcile the entire family,
    <br>but the following Sunday, he also blessed them with 300 000 naira with some bags of rice,
    <br>and he gave scholarships to all of the children,
    <br>who had complained that since their false accusation they had not been going to school.
    <br>Now, the family can go home and begin to live life anew,
    <br>thanks to the glorious Gospel of God's grace,
    <br>and the abundant provision of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>I am delivered
    <br>Amen
    <br>I am delivered
    <br>By Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I was tied by the spirit of the satan
    <br>I am delivered
    <br>Amen
