    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning once again.
    <br>Your spirit is lifted up.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Yes, so if your faith is enhanced and you have found yourself there,
    <br>what are we expecting from you?
    <br>The Spirit will increase to the degree you stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Spirit will increase to the degree you stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The Spirit of God will increase to the degree you stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.
    <br>I hope you honour His Word.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How much do you value the Word of God?"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>How much do you value the Word of God?
    <br>That is it. When you say, "In Jesus' name",
    <br>the power that flows from His name will be in proportion to your love for His Word.
    <br>"In Jesus' name!"
    <br>People see it as a tradition - "Amen."
    <br>Even if you don't believe, you say, "Amen".
    <br>The power that will flow from His name - "In Jesus' name" -
    <br>will be in proportion to your love for His Word.
    <br>"In Jesus' name."
    <br>So you can know if you love Jesus and
    <br>you can know how much you love Jesus through "In Jesus' name".
    <br>So some people say, "I know".
    <br>"How much do you love Jesus?" - they say, "I don't know".
    <br>If you don't know how much you love Jesus - okay.
    <br>"We used to pray at home" or when I'm praying, "In Jesus' name", you say, "Amen".
    <br>The power that flows from His name will be in proportion to your love for His Word.
    <br>You can know how much you love Jesus. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You can know how much you love Jesus.
    <br>Again.
    <br>You can know how much you love Jesus.
    <br>You say, "How much do I love Jesus. I don't know what you are talking about".
    <br>Any moment from now, I will say, "Be delivered!".
    <br>What happens determines how much I love Jesus.
    <br>"Be healed!"
    <br>The power that flows from His name - "Be healed" - will be in proportion to my love for His Word.
    <br>If there is no love, He cannot come into the scene.
    <br>"In Jesus' name" - He cannot come out - "What are you saying? What do you want me to do?"
    <br>Without love - no. Because Himself is love.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How much do you love Jesus?"
    <br>You can know.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You can know".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>You can know how much you love Jesus.
    <br>To love Jesus more and more is by attending to His Word and keeping His Word in your heart.
    <br>Because His word is your life and health to your flesh.
    <br>People keep saying, "How will I believe?"
    <br>There is no other way to believe than to act on what God has spoken.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Act on what God has what? - Spoken.
    <br>Thou shall not kill, thou shall not destroy, though shall not this.
    <br>Act on what God has spoken.
    <br>Believing demands action.
    <br>Action.
    <br>The problem of believing is made easy, simple
    <br>when we know that it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>"How will I believe now? I thought I believe."
    <br>That is why the book of Romans 10:9-10 says that in our heart we believe.
    <br>How can we believe in our heart?
    <br>To believe in our heart means our spirit - that is our heart - acting upon the Word.
    <br>That is the meaning.
    <br>Our heart - means spirit - acts upon the Word of God.
    <br>That means, it is not mental assent, it is not something we can memorise;
    <br>it must become an integral part of you.
    <br>When the Word of God begins to dominate your heart, you begin to believe.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>It is not when you memorise.
    <br>When it is here, you can preach or teach it. - No.
    <br>When the Word of God begins to dominate your heart - that is your spirit - you begin to believe.
    <br>When you begin to believe, your character and your conduct will begin to be influenced.
    <br>The way you behaved before - you lie - you are just seeing yourself, "Thou shall not lie!"
    <br>You hate - you realise, "Thou shall not hate!"
    <br>Acting on the Word is letting God act through you.
    <br>Acting on the Word then gives God an opportunity to heal you, to talk to you,
    <br>to eat with you and to speak to you.
    <br>All what you are seeing talks much about faith.
    <br>Don't forget that it is this faith that releases the belief in our heart.
    <br>The belief will remain locked but faith will take the key, open and ask the belief to come out.
    <br>If not, the belief will remain there perpetually but faith unlocks the belief.
    <br>"Since I believe" but where is the faith to open the door for belief to come out?
    <br>Christians believe today but their belief is dormant because it is imprisoned.
    <br>Their belief is imprisoned without faith.
    <br>"I have money."
    <br>"Where is the money?"
    <br>"It is in the bank."
    <br>"Go and cash it."
    <br>But you cannot cash it.
    <br>You know that you have money. It is there. It is saved.
    <br>That is the same - belief without faith.
    <br>Faith is practical; it is action.
    <br>Like a good example I was giving you some time ago.
    <br>You pray because you saw the weather change, becoming darker,
    <br>and you are about to go to work.
    <br>It seems it's about to rain, and you need to go to work.
    <br>You now say that you are a Christian and go down on your knees
    <br>to say, "Lord, stop this rain!"
    <br>And you say to yourself, you have the conviction that God will stop the rain, and you say, "Amen!"
    <br>You laugh and dress up.
    <br>While going, you take an umbrella along with you.
    <br>What is the purpose of that umbrella?
    <br>In case it rains.
    <br>That nullifies your faith.
    <br>That is out of unbelief.
    <br>That is belief without faith.
    <br>It's like you were worried before that some people would come and disturb you - attack you.
    <br>Now you pray. After the prayer, you continue that worry, distress.
    <br>Belief without faith.
    <br>You are here for the salvation of your soul and some issue you want God to attend to.
    <br>Now having access to sit and watch, being right inside the church at last,
    <br>why do you still begin to worry again?
    <br>You believe without faith.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith.
    <br>How can that your belief be released?
    <br>That's a good question.
    <br>The power that flows from His name, Jesus, will be in proportion to our love for His Word.
    <br>You can know if you are a Christian.
    <br>You can know how much He loves you.
    <br>You can know.
    <br>Can I ask you a question? How much do you love Jesus?
    <br>Very much.
    <br>Very much? Not how much Jesus loves you because He always loves you.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>How much do you love Jesus?
    <br>I believe that my life depends on Jesus. I can't live without Him.
    <br>You mean your life depends on Jesus; you cannot live without Him.
    <br>May you accept Him as your Creator?
    <br>Yes, I accept Jesus as my great Creator.
    <br>But you have not accepted Him as your Guardian.
    <br>He created you - you agree. But you would never agree that He should guide you.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You can create something and allow that thing to be guided by something else.
    <br>That is the life we live.
    <br>We accept Him as our Creator but we never see Him as our Guardian.
    <br>See Him as your Creator. Now see Him as your Guardian.
    <br>You can't create something and then give it to another creator to guide it - justl ike adoption.
    <br>You need to know how much you love Jesus, and not how much Jesus loves you.
    <br>Jesus loves you so much.
    <br>How much you love Him - that is the question now.
    <br>So how can you wake up in the morning, you pray without direction?
    <br>Not that you sense His presence to pray.
    <br>You just see it as a reason - conventional, the way you were brought up that you must wake up and pray.
    <br>At such time you must pray - not that you sense His presence,
    <br>not that He instructs you or you hear...
    <br>I mean, if I pray for you now - you say you are sick and I pray for you -
    <br>I must sense God's healing touching you before I can say, "You are healed".
    <br>If I do not sense God's healing touching you and I say, "You are healed", this means I'm fake.
    <br>I must sense God's healing touching you and say, "Ah, you are healed".
    <br>By the time you do this - "Ah, I am healed!"
    <br>I must sense God's healing touching you;
    <br>I must sense God's deliverance and God's blessing touching you.
    <br>If I don't know whom you are in the spirit, how will I be telling you -
    <br>"You are this, you are that", and just guess.
    <br>We don't follow Him in guessing, on our own.
    <br>Do you listen to what you are saying because all on your mind is to receive healing?
    <br>You don't know how much you love Jesus.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Do you want to know how much?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>By attending to His word, allowing His word in the midst of your heart
    <br>and seeing His word as your life and healing to your flesh.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You are here now for healing and you say you believe but you are still worried.
    <br>That worry nullifies your faith.
    <br>Okay, Man of God.
    <br>If you have faith - don't just believe but you have faith -
    <br>you'll begin to give thanks to God even when that healing has not even come.
    <br>Okay, Man of God.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Difficulty in walking due to lumbar spondylosis and osteoarthritis in my knees,
    <br>tighs, back, waist and feet.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The reason why I said, "Come on" is because I could sense God's healing touching you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Remove it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am healed! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I can run! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am healed!
    <br>For so many years suffering with arthritis!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I can dance!
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree that we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>How do we reverence His Word?
    <br>By attending to His Word and allowing His Word in the midst of our hearts,
    <br>seeing His Word as our life and healing to all our flesh.
    <br>What happened to this woman now has affected you there.
    <br>I mean, as this woman was healed, you were healed there. You don't know.

    <br>But he is still carrying the gadget - carrying everything.
    <br>"Until the man touches me or talks to me."
    <br>As the woman was healed here, I could sense God's healing touching you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take this thing from your mouth.
    <br>Stand up, you are healed!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can breathe!
    <br>I feel cold air coming into me. I was hot before but now I feel my body cold.
    <br>Why should I be the one to tell you?
    <br>Was it before I told you? Or?
    <br>As soon as that lady stood up there and started running, I felt the cold come to me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Go and tell them! Tell people and mention that!
    <br>Look.
    <br>When ten sick people are together, if one is healed by the power of God, all the others are healed.
    <br>It is a flame; the power is like a smoke.
    <br>If I prepare fire here, the smoke that will come out, every assembly will smell it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If there is faith.
