    <br>Glory, glory, power!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We want to tell the viewers all over the world,
    <br>I mean those who are under the influence of our voice,
    <br>we know your desire and your determination.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>We salute your time.
    <br>We Christians, our time is our faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, 'My time is my faith'.
    <br>'My faith is my time'.
    <br>Viewers, with God, all things are possible.
    <br>We know there are many viewers that are on the sickbed.
    <br>They have been with us since morning while they are lying on the sickbed.
    <br>I want to tell you, it is time to receive.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Whatever condition, whatever situation you are in,
    <br>whatever name they call it -
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal,
    <br>never a burden Jesus cannot bear
    <br>and never a problem Jesus cannot solve.
    <br>Right now, be with me; I am with you.
    <br>This is a question of the heart.
    <br>Heart-to-heart.
    <br>Let someone say, 'Heart-to-heart'.
    <br>Because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>Your 'Amen' may not come from your heart, your attention may not come from your heart
    <br>but I'm telling you, this is a question of the heart.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br> Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, whatever means satan might have used to cage you...
    <br>There are many means satan can use to cage one -
    <br>affliction, setback, depression, rejection.
    <br>Whatever means satan might have used to cage you,
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>There are many people that are in a cage.
    <br>You will see them moving, but they are in a cage.
    <br>It is not only those who are in the prison that are in a cage.
    <br>The most serious cage is for one to be moving around and yet, he is in a cage.
