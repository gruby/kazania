  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning to you all.
    <br>Let's take our reading to the book of 1 Timothy.
    <br>Get home and read from Chapter 1 to the end.
    <br>But I will just go through verse 12 there.
    <br>The Lord's grace to Paul.
    <br>1 Timothy 1: 12: "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength,
    <br>that He considered me trustworthy, appointing me to His service."
    <br>Verse 13:
    <br>"Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man,
    <br>I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief."
    <br>Hallelujah. Take your reading from verse 1 when you get home -
    <br>from verse 1 to the end of 1 Timothy.
    <br>You will have so much to learn here.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I saw a woman when I was coming
    <br>who nearly felt so much discouraged.
    <br>I didn't know what happened between the woman, the usher and the worker.
    <br>I asked, "Madam, what happened?"
    <br>She said, "Oh! This is embarrassment!"
    <br>"Oh, embarrassment. Tell me what happened."
    <br>"Ah! I was about to come in... They were asking me..."
    <br>I said, "Ok. It is like you have so much to tell me, and I'm running out of time.
    <br>If you have so much to tell me, I'm running out of time.
    <br>There is no way I can listen.
    <br>So, let me leave you behind. Let me just...
    <br>Okay, after the service, just wait for me.
    <br>Forget about whatever happened.
    <br>Wait for me after the service. You will be my guest".
    <br>She laughed.
    <br>She had so much to tell me, and I was running out of time.
    <br>That will base my message today.
    <br>God cannot use a discouraged servant.
    <br>I will not say God cannot bless but let me say God cannot use a discouraged servant.
    <br>Are you one of the discouraged servants?
    <br>You can get irritated; anything can overwhelm you - just anything.
    <br>Maybe somebody messed there.
    <br>You know that the atmosphere was friendly but suddenly you begin to sense some nasty odour.
    <br>You will not be able to tell your neighbour that somebody has messed.
    <br>But you just feel so worried.
    <br>"This odour is not good! Somebody is messy!"
    <br>Anything can overwhelm you.
    <br>Anything can discourage you. You just say, "I'm leaving from here!"
    <br>The place you are going to may be even worse than the place you left.
    <br>Or even the atmosphere - maybe the weather.
    <br>You feel - "Look at the crowd! I don't know when and how this man can manage to attend to everyone!
    <br>What has he been doing since morning?"
    <br>God cannot use a discouraged servant.
    <br>We must overcome such attitude as a Christian.
    <br>Satan has a way of making you feel overwhelmed, worry and complain.
    <br>You are happy now.
    <br>But after a little time - maybe when I am praying for people, I just touched...
    <br>Suddenly maybe, I did not touch you.
    <br>"Ahh! These people have followed me here today!"
    <br>So, if they followed you here, they are the ones saying I shouldn't touch you.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>You thought you are the next person to be touched.
    <br>Maybe somebody just fell on the floor, and I try to jump to the other side
    <br>and I escape you. You say, "Ah! These people have come here again!"
    <br>If they come here, would they ask me not to touch you?
    <br>If they have power over you, would they have power over me?
    <br>Over our Lord Jesus Christ?
    <br>So, anything, just anything.
    <br>Or maybe, probably, you are expecting to fall during the touching.
    <br>You saw your neighbour falling down but you are still standing.
    <br>"The thing does not work on me!"
    <br>You now begin to look at the people who are turning.
    <br>They have touched you and you are still the same.
    <br>"Ah! The thing does not work for me!"
    <br>God does as He wills.
    <br>It is not necessary that you should fall.
    <br>When God touches you, you may not even experience anything.
    <br>But God is working out the answer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I may even not touch you. I may just see you and leave you.
    <br>That is the instruction given - "Don't touch this man. Don't touch this woman".
    <br>And the problem is gone without touching you.
    <br>It is the instruction. It is not you, it is me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God cannot use a discouraged servant.
    <br>We must overcome such attitude.
    <br>So much of this attitude can lead to discouragement.
    <br>Even mosquito.
    <br>You may be fasting. You may be in the mountain for three days.
    <br>Suddenly, one big mosquito just comes.
    <br>That is the one that gives you awareness.
    <br>What about the one that has been on your body for two hours,
    <br>sucking so much blood?
    <br>By the time you just move your hand - a pool of blood!
    <br>"Oh! This mosquito has carried many diseases!"
    <br>A lot of discouragement.
    <br>We must confess with our mouth like the Book of Revelation 12:11 says
    <br>because what goes around must surely come around.
    <br>When we plant a wrong seed, a wrong harvest will surely come.
    <br>So, our confession is very important - what you say -
    <br>by saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: By saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>By saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>By saying about ourselves what the Bible says about us.
    <br>We are made to overcome.
    <br>The Book of Philippians 4:13 says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me".
    <br>By saying about yourself what the Bible says about you.
    <br>What does the Bible say about you?
    <br>No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, stay steady.
    <br>Look at what the Bible says in the Book of 1 Timothy.
    <br>Paul warned Timothy not to take a step back when he is sick, attacked, persecuted.
    <br>He warned him not to take a step back when he is sick, persecuted or discouraged.
    <br>But what is happening to you today?
    <br>Remember, what is good for Timothy is equally good for us.
    <br>He is warning us not to take a step back while we are facing persecution or crisis
    <br>because persecution or whatever you call it is meant for our spiritual benefit.
    <br>What do you understand under "take a step back"?
    <br>By beginning to complain, looking at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>"Why me of all this? Why me of all that?
    <br>I have stopped smoking. I have stopped drinking.
    <br>I have been praying. I go to church regularly. Why all this crisis? Why all this? Why all that?"
    <br>That is the beauty of our journey to eternal life.
    <br>Don't forget, we are not in Heaven. Something must punch us, poke us and test our faith.
    <br>He went further by saying,
    <br>"Timothy, I know what you are talking about.
    <br>You are talking about your setback,
    <br>you are talking about your sickness,
    <br>you are talking about people that accused you wrongly,
    <br>you are talking about this, you are talking about that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you read that Chapter down, he says that
    <br>he messed up big time but God enabled him.
    <br>"To mess up big time" means that he has done a lot,
    <br>being a persecutor, blasphemor and killer - this and that.
    <br>When you look up the word 'enable', it means to support with means, power and knowledge.
    <br>When God gives enablement, He gives everything.
    <br>Even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you fear not.
    <br>Paul Apostle said to Timothy, "I know what it is like to feel like giving up
    <br>while sick, facing disappointment or persecution".
    <br>He said he knew what it was like but he did not do it; he held on and kept fighting.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He held on and kept fighting.
    <br>The beauty of our journey is when you are going and something is there to punch you.
    <br>But when you are going and nothing punches you, you are free, 
    <br>how will you know that the Father you are serving is beautiful.
    <br>When you don't sit for an examination and read and sweat
    <br>to get a promotion, how will you value the promotion?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you do not read day and night,
    <br>in a quiet place reading a lot of textbooks,
    <br>sitting for the exam - very tough -
    <br>and at the end of the day, you come out brilliantly,
    <br>how will you value your certificate?
    <br>Why are you proud to introduce yourself as a graduate?
    <br>"I have a first degree, PhD."
    <br>You are proud to introduce yourself because of what you have gone through to have that.
    <br>The beauty of our journey is when something is there to test our faith.
    <br>That is the beauty of our journey.
    <br>But you never knew this.
    <br>Various tests that would have promoted you spiritually,
    <br>you failed them because you see them as an attack from the enemy.
    <br>You see them as undeserved attacks, undeserved issues
    <br>instead of you to welcome that and see that as a friend to move you forward.
    <br>Your situations are friends to move you forward.
    <br>Your challenges are friends to move you ahead.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Let your situation produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Let your situation produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>Yes, when you have challenges and those challenges now strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>They cause you to look unto God the more.
    <br>You are a type that sleeps anyhow, eats anyhow.
    <br>But when the challenges come, you go into fasting and pray the more.
    <br>It is no longer a challenge but a promotion.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Write this: Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>When the challenges come - it could be sickness, poverty, hardship, temptation or any foolish thing,
    <br>and you quickly look unto God and cry to God, it's meant for promotion.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let your challenges produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>That is, when we pray, "Oh God, I cannot get along without You; help me!"
    <br>He will show Himself stronger.
    <br>But when challenges come and it does not produce a sense of dependence on God,
    <br>you are leading to the grave.
    <br>Challenges come - it could be trouble -
    <br>and when that trouble comes, you enter into more trouble again,
    <br>more trouble again, more trouble again, more trouble again,
    <br>and you never look unto God to get out of that trouble,
    <br>you know that this is the end of you.
    <br>How do we know promotion is coming?
    <br>When challenges come and produce a sense of dependence on God,
    <br>you know you are about to be promoted.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, stay steady.
    <br>Make this confession your roadmap.
    <br>I'm standing on the promise of God.
    <br>I am living steady, walking steady, remaining steady in unsteady times.
    <br>I choose not to be broke.
    <br>I choose not to live in poverty.
    <br>I choose not to walk in disappointment.
    <br>I choose to walk in God's way.
    <br>This world is unsteady.
    <br>It is unsteady.
    <br>This world you are living in is unsteady.
    <br>This is why the Bible says, "In this world, there will be tribulation",
    <br>because it is unsteady.
    <br>There will be lying, killing, stealing.
    <br>You look here - rubbish. You look there - rubbish.
    <br>You can't close your eyes when walking.
    <br>Even if you close your eyes, your heart will be yearning to smoke, for fleshly desires.
    <br>While having your eyes closed, your heart will still yearn for fleshly desires.
    <br>So, we are in an unsteady world.
    <br>This is why the song says, "This world is not my home".
    <br>This world is not my home
    <br>I'm just passing through
    <br>My treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon me from Heaven's open doors
    <br>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
    <br>This world is not my home
    <br>I'm just passing through
    <br>My treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon me from Heaven's open doors
    <br>And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are in an unsteady world.
    <br>So, I want to leave you here.
    <br>Take this: 
    <br>When your situation reminds you of God, know that promotion is coming.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour: When your situation reminds you of God, know that promotion is coming.
    <br>This is what I mean by our situation is meant for our spiritual benefit.
    <br>Our situation produces a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>When you have a situation, headache or a doctor says to you,
    <br>"Oh! This is serious! This is cancer! This is the liver!",
    <br>and this reminds you immediately of God, knowing that promotion is coming.
    <br>It is not meant to destroy you but to improve you - your relationship with God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, for other people - their situation does not remind them of God
    <br>because that situation is meant to destroy them.
    <br>But we - our situation reminds us of God.
    <br>That is why it produces a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>Our situation reminds us of God.
    <br>That situation is to improve us.
    <br>When you have a situation - no matter how big that situation -
    <br>and it reminds you of God, and you begin to fast and pray,
    <br>it is meant to build your relationship and strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>Rise up and make this confession your standard from today:
    <br>I'm standing on the promise of God.
    <br>I'm living steady, walking steady, remaining steady in unsteady times.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>So, you think that the ground is smooth for me.
    <br>In a little time you hear T.B. Joshua is in America, T.B. Joshua is there.
    <br>You say, "Oh, this man! Oh my God, he is not going through what I'm going through!
    <br>Look! Everything is just smooth for this man!"
    <br>Ooh! The ground is not smooth! It is like this!
    <br>Just like you are walking on it, I'm walking on it.
    <br>But I'm living steady in an unsteady world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, it is not smooth for you.
    <br>You go by the standard of the ground.
    <br>I'm not going by the standard.
    <br>This is how the ground is vibrating and you too go by that vibration.
    <br>The ground is vibrating like this but I remain steady.
    <br>Whilst it is vibrating, I remain steady.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are living in the same world.
    <br>We are eating the same food.
    <br>But the difference is that whilst the ground is vibrating - this way -,
    <br>you go by that vibration.
    <br>Because of that, whatever you carry, seems to fall.
    <br>But I walk steady on the vibrating ground.
    <br>I say, "No! I refuse to be broke.
    <br>I refuse to be poor.
    <br>I refuse to live in poverty
    <br>and I refuse to walk in discouragement!"
    <br>There's a lot of discouragement around but I refuse to walk in discouragement.
    <br>But you are walking in discouragement.
    <br>So much poverty around - just like you are seeing them, I am seeing them.
    <br>But I refuse to live in poverty.
    <br>So, we are walking on the same floor - unsteady world.
    <br>You are living there - you are there and I am there.
    <br>And it is not steady at all but you go by that vibration.
    <br>I refuse to.
    <br>You can refuse to. The name Jesus is given to you.
    <br>"Behold, I give you power to trample on scorpions and snakes."
    <br>Let me pray with you.
    <br>I pray the Lord gives you a hearing heart.
    <br>When situations come - no matter the sickness, disease, temptation,
    <br>false accusation or whatever comes to you and you know you are a Christian,
    <br>it is time to look unto God, the Finisher of our faith,
    <br>and He will show Himself stronger.
    <br>So, take this message.
    <br>But if you are not a Christian, not a believer, this is not an issue
    <br>because for others, their situation destroys them.
    <br>Their situation cannot make them look unto God.
    <br>Their situation cannot produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>Rather, their situation takes them away.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>If you are a believer, stop seeing your situation as an enemy.
    <br>Let your situation produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>When we pray, "Oh Lord, I cannot get along without You",
    <br>He will show Himself stronger.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Come on. What lesson have you learnt from this message?
    <br>I have learnt that I must depend on God.
    <br>Whatever challenge or situation I go through, I must depend on God's Word.
    <br>Your situation should produce a sense - that is, a feeling that it is time to go to God the more.
    <br>You shouldn't leave that for your situation.
    <br>You that have the situation should know that you need God the more
    <br>I need God the more.
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>That is the voice of situation.
    <br>That is the voice of a Christian's situation.
    <br>That is the voice of a believer's situation that hears the voice.
    <br>Not others - others' situation cannot say this.
    <br>But our situation - this is the voice.
    <br>Sing again - listen to the voice.
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>That is situation.
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>Like a flower needs the rain
    <br>Like a bird needs the wind
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>Thank you. 
    <br>You are crying. Why are you crying?
    <br>What do you want to tell the world about this message?
    <br>I'm so thankful for this message because it spoke into my heart.
    <br>For every situation that I face, I mustn't think it is the end of the world.
    <br>I must just know that God is there for me and I must just push through
    <br>and have the Word of God inside of me.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Any other?
    <br>Can I hear from you?
    <br>How does the message appeal to you?
    <br>This is exactly correct.
    <br>My situation demanded to bring me here.
    <br>This is exactly correct.
    <br>I am a pastor but wherever I go, there are failures.
    <br>That failures that come to me are right and correct.
    <br>Thank you. He said he is a minister of God.
    <br>He looked at situations before now as an enemy but it is a friend.
    <br>It is more of our friend than our enemy.
    <br>Our situation is more of our friend than our enemy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Our situation is more of our friend than our enemy.
    <br>My situation is more of my friend than my enemy.
    <br>Yes, it is more of our friend than our enemy.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>I know what situation has done in my life - to me.
    <br>I'm using my life to preach a message to you.
    <br>If not the situation from the beginning of my ministry,
    <br>I don't think I would be of this level today.
    <br>Your rejection becomes a blessing to me.
    <br>Your rejection leads to my closeness to God,
    <br>helping me to build my relationship with God,
    <br>helping me to have enough time for God.
    <br>Yes, your rejection.
    <br>At a time you realised that "Oh no! This is a man we should move closer to",
    <br>well, I think I have come very close to God.
    <br>At the beginning, if you had accepted me, I think I would have had problems. 
    <br>Big problems - your acceptance would have led to fall, to failure.
    <br>Acceptance at the beginning of my ministry - "He is a man of God!" -
    <br>today you would not talk about The Synagogue
    <br>because then, I was not mature to maintain acceptance.
    <br>Now I am mature to maintain acceptance.
    <br>You can accept me; I am ready.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know, there is time for everything. 
    <br>This is why I don't fight back because God allowed you to reject me from the beginning of the ministry. 
    <br>The rejection from the beginning of the ministry was allowed by God
    <br>because God was building me and I was not mature to have all over the world around me then.
    <br>I needed some experience.
    <br>Oh yes!
    <br>You are my friend.
    <br>Ok. Thank you.
