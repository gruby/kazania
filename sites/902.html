    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer And Prophecy In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on. There is a challenge you are facing. You should learn to forgive.
    <br>Forgive this man because this is what is affecting your son.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Acting on the prophetic word, the following Sunday,
    <br>the woman returned to The SCOAN with her son
    <br>whom the prophecy had revealed had been negatively affected.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministered prayer to the congregation,
    <br>the power of the Holy Spirit tore down the kingdom of satan and set the captives free.
    <br>During the prayer, the woman who received the prophecy
    <br>cried out for God's mercy to speak for her son.
    <br>Man of God, he is an armed robber. Man of God, please help me.
    <br>Man of God, help me. He is an armed robber.
    <br>Man of God, help me deliver my son. He is a fraudster. He is into everything.
    <br>He refused to go to school. Man of God, help me.
    <br>He is addicted to drugs. Man of God, help me.
    <br>He is delivered in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Mrs Eno Ekanem.
    <br>The person standing next to
    <br> me is my son Emmanuel Ekanem.
    <br>He's 27 years old.
    <br>Two Sundays ago, the man of God walked up to me and prophesied
    <br>that I had a challenge, that I 
    <br>should forgive this man.
    <br>That that was the cause of 
    <br>the problem I have with my son.
    <br>This man happens to be my husband for over 35 years.
    <br>Emmanuel is the last of four children.
    <br>He is the last.
    <br>Emmanuel has given us so much pain.
    <br>Emmanuel has been a child that
    <br>we wished he should have died
    <br>so that the family can have peace,
    <br>so that the family's name will not be in the mud.
    <br>The man in question is my husband
    <br>but he never played the role of a 
    <br>father to them.
    <br>He sort of allowed everything to be on my shoulders.
    <br>The man of God actually saw my heart
    <br>because I have been pained, I've been living in pain.
    <br>He hurt me so much.
    <br>After the prophecy on that Sunday,
    <br>I was contemplating on calling him
    <br>because we had not seen him for a very long time,
    <br>we had not heard from him, his phone was switched off.
    <br>The whole of Sunday I said to myself that there was no need to call him
    <br>because we didn't know where 
    <br>he was -  whether he's dead or not.
    <br>I didn't want to have pain again.
    <br>But on Monday morning, I just woke up and the Spirit of God said, "Call him!"
    <br>I called Emmanuel. Lo and behold, 
    <br>the line that had not been ringing rang.
    <br>And I screamed, "Emmanuel, where are you?"
    <br>He said, "Mummy, I'm around."
    <br>I said, "Can you come right 
    <br>away to the Synagogue to see me".
    <br>That is how the prophecy came to pass immediately.
    <br>He came last week and received his own deliverance.
    <br>My name is Emmanuel Ekanem.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my mum.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN because I had the problem of stealing, smoking,
    <br>I was addicted to drugs, I was a fraudster - I did online fraud, credit card fraud.
    <br>Whatever thing that has to do with fraud, you just name it.
    <br>I was also involved with some friends 
    <br>of mine who were into armed robbery.
    <br>This problem of mine started a very long time ago,
    <br>from when I was very young.
    <br>I was always very brilliant in school. I never even used to read for my exams.
    <br>I was always brilliant but I always 
    <br>had this spirit of stealing,
    <br>taking what wasn't mine like phones, money - I would take people's money and phones.
    <br>I was always bringing 
    <br>embarrassment to my family
    <br>because even in school, like in secondary school, I would steal someone's money
    <br>and they would have to call my parents to come to school.
    <br>So I was always bringing shame to my family.
    <br>That's how it had been from when I was even very little. Just making bad friends.
    <br>I was making bad friends by default,
    <br>I didn't even have to try hard.
    <br>Every friend I was making was bad.
    <br>I am actually from a very good home.
    <br>I didn't have any reason for doing all this.
    <br>I was sent to the best schools that you could think of.
    <br>I was even sent to Canada, I was in Canada as of 2009.
    <br>I gained admission into the University
    <br> of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada.
    <br>So that was where I got involved with credit-card fraud.
    <br>I made a lot of bad friends, I was into drugs,
    <br>I was smoking all the time, I wasn't 
    <br>even going to school.
    <br>My mum would always send me
    <br> school fees to pay my school fees,
    <br>but I would always end up spending the money on drugs,
    <br>going to clubs and I wasn't going to school.
    <br>I'm also very good with computers.
    <br>Anything that has to do with computers - I can programme, I can do softwares and hacking,
    <br>whatever you can think of.
    <br>I was into credit card fraud.
    <br>I was cloning different credit 
    <br>cards and different people's accounts.
    <br>So I was doing this over time.
    <br>There was this job that I did - this credit card job I did for 200,000 dollars.
    <br>I was the one that did everything.
    <br>I cloned the credit card, went 
    <br>into the bank and withdrew this money.
    <br>My picture and everything was in the bank.
    <br>Prior to this time, I never used to go into the bank to do anything
    <br>but that very time I went to the bank.
    <br>I withdrew the money and the 
    <br>police started looking for me in Canada.
    <br>Then I was trying to move to
    <br> a different city to just lay low.
    <br>So on trying to go, I actually got caught by the police,
    <br>and I was the first person they caught, and I told them the names
    <br>of five of my accomplices that did the credit card scam.
    <br>I noticed that most of the
    <br>people that I got arrested with
    <br>were given long jail terms
    <br>like 5 years, 10 years, 15 years.
    <br>All this while, my mom didn't know I was in jail.
    <br>I was the only one that they gave the option 
    <br>of being deported back to Nigeria.
    <br>I don't even know why because 
    <br>I didn't even have a lawyer at that time
    <br>that would represent me in court or anything.
    <br>At the end of the day, I was deported and that is how my mum found out
    <br>that I was not going to school 
    <br>and I was living this life of crime.
    <br>When I got back to Nigeria, my mom actually tried.
    <br>She wanted to set me up with
    <br>a business, to do shows.
    <br>She gave me 7 million naira and a brand new hilux.
    <br>It was her vehicle at that time so upon coming back,
    <br>she gave me the car to be using around.
    <br>She lives in Abuja so I was in Abuja with her at that point in time.
    <br>So when she gave me the money 
    <br>and the car,
    <br>I left Abuja and ran to Lagos 
    <br>with two friends that I had just made.
    <br>They were into drugs - we were always smoking together, going to nightclubs and all that.
    <br>When we came down to Lagos, I started staying in a hotel until when the 7 million were exhausted.
    <br>I didn't have any money. I sold the hilux that my mum had given to me.
    <br>She had bought the hilux for 7.5 million.
    <br>I sold it for like  2.3 million naira -
    <br>way less than the value of the car.
    <br>All for just drugs, going to nightclubs, and staying in a hotel.
    <br>The money finished at the end of the day.
    <br>So I ran back to my mom in Abuja 
    <br>and that was how it was going on and on.
    <br>Even one day I took her 
    <br>cheque book and I wrote everything on it.
    <br>I forged her signature and I went to the bank.
    <br>They actually paid me the amount of 500,000 on the cheque book.
    <br>So that's what I was doing. And any time I did this, I would always run away.
    <br>When the money was exhausted, I would always run back.
    <br>So this was going on and on until my mum started having medical issues -
    <br>she was having high blood pressure.
    <br>She couldn't deal with me anymore.
    <br>So she told me that I should come down to Lagos and stay with my father
    <br>because my dad lives here in Lagos.
    <br>So I came to Lagos to stay with my dad, and it was just the same thing.
    <br>I was giving my dad stress. I would take his money and run away.
    <br>I wouldn't come back, mingle with bad friends, smoke, take drugs and everything.
    <br>I met some friends that were into armed robbery at a point here in Lagos.
    <br>They posed to me as internet fraudsters.
    <br>I thought maybe that was what they were into.
    <br>Later, I discovered that they were into armed robbery.
    <br>They initiated me into the gang 
    <br>and I started going on operations with them.
    <br>That's how the thing just continued.
    <br>I was going on operations with my friends who were armed robbers.
    <br>We were actually carrying guns when going on these operations.
    <br>We were making so much money but 
    <br>they were not giving me enough.
    <br>One of the members told me that if I continued, 
    <br>I would start getting more money
    <br>as compared to when I just started going
    <br>out with them on robbery incidents.
    <br>I also was getting people totrust me.
    <br>Once they trusted me, I would take their properties and just run away.
    <br>I also deceived people because I would 
    <br>tell people that my mum was very influential
    <br>and if they wanted to get visas to 
    <br>travel abroad, they could give me the money,
    <br>then I would talk to my mum 
    <br>and we would procure the visas for them.
    <br>I did this to three or four different people.
    <br>Some people gave me 1 million, 2 million,
    <br>1.5 million, and I would just run away with the money.
    <br>They would trace me back to my mom.
    <br>My mom would say that she hadn't seen me for months,
    <br>She didn't even know where I was or where I was sleeping.
    <br>That's how it was going on and on while
    <br> I was living with my dad here in Lagos.
    <br>Three weeks ago I took my 
    <br>dad's phone and I went to sell it.
    <br>After selling my dad's phone,
    <br>he got angry with me.
    <br>He locked the house and told me that I shouldn't come back unless I came back with his phone.
    <br>He didn't know that I was 
    <br>with his car keys at that point.
    <br>In the night, I went into the house, started the car, opened the gate quietly and drove the car out.
    <br>I didn't have a phone, I was just with the car.
    <br>I was sleeping inside the car.
    <br>At night, I would just park the 
    <br>car somewhere that I felt was safe,
    <br>and I would just sleep there until the next morning - surviving then.
    <br>Two weeks ago on Sunday, 
    <br>I had parked by a barber saloon.
    <br>There was a barber saloon by the side.
    <br>Then I saw the prophet's picture on the sliding door of the barber saloon
    <br>but I didn't put any meaning into it. That was where I was throughout that Sunday.
    <br>You mean, you saw a sticker 
    <br>with Prophet T.B. Joshua's picture on it.
    <br>I saw a sticker with his picture 
    <br>- a very big sticker with his picture there.
    <br>So that was where I was that Sunday. But I didn't really put any meaning into it.
    <br>In fact, that Sunday, I ran out of money, I didn't have money.
    <br>I was with the car. I was trying to sell the car
    <br>but for some reason, I was not getting anybody that was interested in buying it.
    <br>On that Sunday, I wanted to put my sim card in the phone - in any phone I could get
    <br>so that I could call those my 
    <br>friends that were into armed robbery
    <br>and see if I could go with them on any operation.
    <br>Just to get little money because I was out of money.
    <br>So that Monday morning, I just spoke to the barber at the saloon.
    <br>I told him that the car had broken down. I needed to call someone to help me fix it.
    <br>So when I put my sim card in the phone,  I didn't even dial any number.
    <br>The call that came in - it was my mum.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So at the very moment you placed the SIM card in that phone, your mom just called?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And when was the last time you
    <br>had seen or spoken with her?
    <br>For over eight months I had not seen or spoken to her.
    <br>So when I saw the caller's number, I was very surprised.
    <br>When I picked the call, I thought 
    <br>she was going to shout at me,
    <br>ask me where I was with the car and everything.
    <br>So when I picked the call, she asked me where I was.
    <br>I told her I was around in Lagos here.
    <br>I didn't even know she was also in Lagos.
    <br>She told me that I should start coming down here.
    <br>I told her I didn't have any money.
    <br>She told me I should find a way.
    <br>I should enter a taxi, whatever I could find and just come down here to The SCOAN.
    <br>So I came down here on that Monday.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Brother, we saw that on last week's Sunday, your mum cried out to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>as he was moving around, praying for people
    <br>and we saw how he prayed for you in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Can you just describe what happened to you at that point.
    <br>At the point when the prophet touched me, I felt like - for 2 or 3 minutes I blacked out.
    <br>I didn't even know where I was at that point in time.
    <br>I didn't even know where I was, I was confused.
    <br>I was weak; everything was just
    <br>going on with me at the same time.
    <br>I was shivering in my bones,
    <br>I was cold, I was hot.
    <br>I was just feeling everything at that point in time.
    <br>And had you ever experienced anything like that before?
    <br>Never, never!
    <br>Many men of God had placed their hands on me.
    <br>When I went to church before, it didn't move me.
    <br>I always prayed for them to touch me 
    <br>to see if I would fall or something like that.
    <br>But I never felt that strong force in me before.
    <br>I knew I was shivering in my body, I started feeling cold.
    <br>I started feeling things leaving me.
    <br>I was just feeling so strange that very day.
    <br>I felt like something was coming out of me, leaving me - my whole body, my legs and my hands.
    <br>I just thank God for my life because I'm
    <br> not even supposed to be living right now.
    <br>I'm just happy from the bottom of my heart.
    <br>Glory be to God and since that touch, just tell us - what are the changes you've seen in your life?
    <br>Before, it was always very hard for me to stay two or three hours without smoking or taking drugs.
    <br>But since that day up till now, it's been
    <br>a week and I haven't even gone near
    <br>cigarettes, drugs or anything pertaining to that.
    <br>So I just give God the glory.
    <br>Now, those people like me - I used to believe that there is a God -
    <br>a life without Jesus is more or less a wasted life.
    <br>We should always look for a way to do good and not do evil.
    <br>Always try and pick your friends and don't let your friends pick you
    <br>because if I had known Jesus earlier, I know that by now, I would have been somewhere -
    <br>greater than where I am today.
    <br>It has just been the devil all the way, right 
    <br>from when I was very young.
    <br>I'm just happy that 
    <br>Jesus has saved me through the prophet.
    <br>I'm glad.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Actually, when I came here the day I left Abuja, I told God that I'm going to a final destination.
    <br>I told myself that there is no way I will leave The SCOAN without a testimony.
    <br>When the man of God walked up to me, I did not expect him to tell me to forgive this man.
    <br>I was hoping that he was going to ask me, "Where is your son",
    <br>like I have heard him ask other people.
    <br>But I was shocked!
    <br>That is to show that he saw my heart; I was in pain.
    <br>I can't deny that. I was so much in pain because the person
    <br>that was supposed to play the role of a father did not do that.
    <br>So I have been living in pain.
    <br>I have forgiven him, Man of God.
    <br>I have forgiven him.
    <br>My son - I speak as a mother - is not supposed to be alive today
    <br>because as a family, we had prayed for him to die.
    <br>The reason I'm saying this is that he caused us so much pain -
    <br>when I mean pain, I mean pain.
    <br>So much embarrassment and shame.
    <br>I cried, went to churches, fasted and prayed but nothing seemed to happen.
    <br>That was why I ran to The SCOAN.
    <br>I never used to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>A friend introduced me to this channel, and I started watching it.
    <br>I just left it on permanently in my bedroom.
    <br>People came to my house and asked, "Oh! You are now for Emmanuel TV, T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>I said, "Yes". - "Without even coming here?"
    <br>I said, "Yes. What I am seeing happening there, I believe it will happen to me too".
    <br>I even told a friend, "One day you will see me testify".
    <br>And today our mother 
    <br>is indeed testifying to the glory of God.
    <br>Before he left for Canada, he first got admission as a child into King's College.
    <br>At King's College, he wasn't there up to a month.
    <br>One morning between 6 and 7am, we just saw him coming in.
    <br>He didn't have any shirt and shoes on him.
    <br>I believe most people know where King's College is located.
    <br>And we asked him, "Where are you coming from?"
    <br>He said, "From school".
    <br>"Without shirt, without shoes?"
    <br>I was scared; this boy was just 9 years old.
    <br>We took him back.
    <br>He was never in school -
    <br>one complaint after the other.
    <br>The father said we should
    <br> take him out of King's College.
    <br>I said, "How can I? This is a school where every parent
    <br> would want her their to be.
    <br>Why would I withdraw him from King's College?"
    <br>We now decided that that was the best thing to do.
    <br>We had to withdraw him from King's College.
    <br>Before taking him out of King's College, we had to look for a school that had the highest fence.
    <br>I personally came down to scout all private schools
    <br>to see which one had the highest fence that he would not scale.
    <br>We got one in Ikeja. He started school.
    <br>The same thing continued and I wondered, "What kind of a thing is this?"
    <br>They gave him corporal punishment for scaling the fence -  a very high fence.
    <br>It continued but during WAEC, the school was shocked and surprised that he had the best results.
    <br>This was a boy that did not read, that was never in school.
    <br>The proprietress called us and said, 
    <br>"Madam, let this boy go to a private university
    <br>so that his time will not be wasted".
    <br>Of all my children, he is the only 
    <br>one that went to a private university.
    <br>He got admission into Babcock University.
    <br>He did not read for the exams, he just walked
    <br> into the exam hall and passed.
    <br>He started University.
    <br>He was not in school for one month.
    <br>The father would go to the school, go to a hospital and get a medical report that he's asthmatic.
    <br>That's why he ran away, he was in the hospital. 
    <br>The father did that three times.
    <br>He did that, and the fourth time, 
    <br>he said, "No, he's not doing it again!"
    <br>Just to cover up for your son?
    <br>Yes, it was a cover-up so that the school would take him back.
    <br>But the fourth time that he left the school, the father said that he was not going to do it again.
    <br>That's how he came back home. What to do with him, we didn't know.
    <br>We just did not know what do with him.
    <br> He was just there.
    <br>We just did not know what to do.
    <br>Each time he disappeared, he would do something.
    <br>At times, when I was in the car, I would be looking at those dust bins, in case I would see a corpse.
    <br>I would be looking at the roadside, hoping that I would see his dead body but it never happened.
    <br>One day in my office, I was making a photocopy of his WAEC results.
    <br>I was crying because the results were fantastic.
    <br>A friend just walked into my office. 
    <br>She just met me, I couldn't hide.
    <br>She said, "Why are you crying?"
    <br>I just threw the result papers to her.
    <br>And she said, "What! This boy got this result?"
    <br>I said, "But he has refused to be in school".
    <br>She said, "Okay, we are going to  send him out of the country. Maybe that will help him".
    <br>That is how his going to Canada came up.
    <br>Before you know it, he got admission. 
    <br>Everything for him is always fast, fast.
    <br>He got admission. He left for Canada.
    <br>I would always visit him, go to the school.
    <br>I would take pictures. He would take me 
    <br>to the school. We would take pictures.
    <br>He would say, "Mommy,  
    <br>this is this, this is that". I would be happy.
    <br>I would return home,
    <br>not knowing that he was not in school.
    <br>That he was just deceiving me.
    <br>The next year I would go again 
    <br>because I wanted to keep track.
    <br>I would go, he would just deceive me, 
    <br>and I would return home.
    <br>So when it happened like that,
    <br>I came back one of the times.
    <br>We hadn't heard from him for a very long time.
    <br>And I was worried.
    <br>One day, a strange person just called and said that he was a lawyer
    <br>representing my son, that my son was in jail.
    <br>My God, and this was during Christmas.
    <br>We were all in Calabar - all of us on Christmas day.
    <br>I couldn't hold myself.
    <br>On a Christmas day, my son was in jail!
    <br>That's how the process of getting
    <br> him out came in.
    <br>The lawyer, I was not there.
    <br>To make a long story short, he was deported.
    <br>And it continued until what we are seeing today.
    <br>I give God the glory - the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That is the God that I will worship.
    <br>I will worship that God until the 
    <br>day I am called to rest.
    <br>Because that God has...

    <br>I didn't even know he was into armed robbery.
    <br>I'm hearing it for the first time.
    <br>I didn't know. I thought it was all these other ones.
    <br>I never knew he had joined armed robbers.
    <br>Even when I was shouting, "Man of God, help me! He is an armed robber",
    <br>I just wanted to say anything that entered my mouth.
    <br>I just wanted to attract the attention of the man of God.
    <br>I didn't know he was actually an armed robber.
    <br>When I went back to Abuja, I told his older sister,
    <br>when she said, "Mummy, we saw you shouting, 'Armed robber!'
    <br>Is Emma an armed robber?"
    <br>I said, "I just wanted to 
    <br>get the man of God's attention".
    <br>Nobody in the family knew that he was an armed robber.
    <br>I just said it that day - until now.
    <br>But I give God the glory because
    <br>this God is a covenant keeping God.
    <br>Something had always told me that I was going to testify about this Emmanuel in a large congregation.
    <br>It is not today - over 10 years ago in my church,
    <br>something kept telling me that I was going to testify in a large congregation
    <br>but it never meant anything to me.
    <br>I thought because he's a 
    <br>musician, he sings very well -
    <br>he has done a video with Pastor Ranky 
    <br>as you see him standing here.
    <br>I thought maybe one day that large congregation or television would be
    <br>as I'm dancing in this video.
    <br>That was what was in my mind.
    <br>But I never knew that it was going to be in a congregation as large as this - worldwide.
    <br>So I give God all the glory.
    <br> I thank the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>God will continue to pour more anointing on you and you will take this generation to the next level.
    <br>I want to advise all other mothers -
    <br>it is not about you spoiling your child.
    <br>He was never a pampered child.
    <br>I don't know how to pamper children.
    <br>I never pampered him,
    <br>I treated him like every other child.
    <br>But we should know that the devil usually picks on a star in the family.
    <br>That is exactly what happened. 
    <br>The devil decided to take my own star.
    <br>But today I have retrieved my star.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to say here that
    <br>I am a member of the Apostolic Church.
    <br>I am a Deaconess. I've been a 
    <br>Deaconess for close to 20 years.
    <br>You don't know where your salvation is.
    <br>This is a ministry, this Synagogue is a church I had always had a negative opinion about.
    <br>As I speak, I am sure most of my pastors will see me
    <br>because even the first day I came, and I got my prophecy, people called me from all over,
    <br>"Are you for T.B. Joshua now?" I said, "Yes! That this is where I can see my salvation".
    <br>And I thank God so much for using 
    <br>the man of God to liberate my family
    <br>because I believe everything has turned around for our good.
    <br>I had always had a negative impression about the church -
    <br>even more than her; her own was even small.
    <br>Because even when she started watching Emmanuel TV in her room,
    <br>any time I was in Abuja in the house, she would always wake everybody up early in the morning,
    <br>at 5:00 am in the morning when I was still sleeping
    <br>because I would usually go to bed at 3 or 4 am.
    <br>At 5 am she would wake everybody up, that we should come for prayers.
    <br>She would spray the Morning Water on us every morning.
    <br>I was always angry, always pissed off.
    <br>I would be like, "Why are you just 
    <br>always disturbing me every morning
    <br>because of this Emmanuel TV,
    <br>this Morning Water, this T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>Even when I was with her in Abuja, she told me a certain time that I would come here.
    <br>That day, we had serious arguments because I was telling her that I didn't believe there was God here,
    <br>that I didn't believe that this was where I would get my salvation or deliverance.
    <br>I've always felt that this was not a place of God.
    <br>But on coming here, It's a different story
    <br>I just thank God because most
    <br>people like me wouldn't believe.
    <br>But if they can just come - take that step of faith and come - they would surely be delivered.
    <br>I also want to use this medium
    <br>to say that I'm very sorry to my mum
    <br>for whatever pain and hurt 
    <br>that I've caused her in the past,
    <br>and I want to promise her that she will be happy to have me as a son.
    <br>She will be proud of me one day.
    <br>Mum, I'm sorry!
