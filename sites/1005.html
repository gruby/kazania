  <p>    
    <br>Evangelist, please help my husband!
    <br>He has lumbar spondylitis and osteoarthritis.
    <br>He cannot walk.
    <br>He cannot lift any heavy object.
    <br>He cannot sit well.
    <br>He cannot do anything. I am the one assisting him.
    <br>He is using a lumbar corset.
    <br>Please, Evangelist, help my husband.
    <br>Even if he takes some drugs, after one hour, the pain becomes severe.
    <br>Please, help my husband. I know this is our last bus stop.
    <br>Evangelist, please help me. I cannot walk.
    <br>This pain is much. I have severe pain in my back and legs.
    <br>I have severe hotness all over my body.
    <br>If I take drugs, they will only work for one or two hours but afterwards, the pain would increase.
    <br>Please, Evangelist, help me.
    <br>It is my wife that has been helping me with everything.
    <br>I cannot walk. Please, Evangelist, help me.
    <br>What do you want God Almighty to do for you today?
    <br>I want our Lord Jesus Christ to save and heal me.
    <br>Evangelist, please. I know this is my last bus stop.
    <br>God will heal me.
    <br>Jesus Christ will save me from this problem.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Yes, Amen.

    <br>and as we administer it in the name of Jesus, healing, deliverance,
    <br>salvation shall be yours today, in Jesus'name.

    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our God is good!
    <br>All the time!
    <br>My name is Mr Monday Ishaka.
    <br>I am 62 years old.
    <br>I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my lovely wife - Mrs Vera O. Ishaka.
    <br>The unbeatable wager of every calamity!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Sir, we want to hear your wonderful testimony.
    <br>Can you first of all share with us more about the problems that brought you here to The SCOAN.
    <br>Fine.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a sickness
    <br>they call lumbar spondylosis and osteoarthritis.
    <br>I could not walk and was using a lumbar corset.
    <br>I came with an inability to walk.
    <br>I had a severe pain all over my back and to make things worse, I had a hotness in my waist
    <br>that at the worst of times, I could not withstand the heat.
    <br>I would cry to God asking Him to come and deliver me from all these problems.
    <br>I was given a series of drugs to take.
    <br>I was tired of drugs of which I told my wife, that let the will of God be done.
    <br>I knew that God would not disappoint me.
    <br>I decided to run to God of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>knowing that He was the only one who could set me free from my problem.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Amen. So with that faith, you came to The SCOAN last week.
    <br>Can you describe what happened to you, sir,
    <br>as the New Morning Water was ministered to you in the name of Jesus?
    <br>Last week, as you saw in the clip, I was brought in a vehicle.
    <br>The pain I experienced was very severe.
    <br>The evangelists came round to minister the Morning Water on me after asking me about my problem.
    <br>I told them everything.
    <br>They then asked me if I believed in the Morning Water to which I replied, Yes, that that was why I was here.
    <br>As the Morning Water was ministered to me, I felt a hot sensation all over my body
    <br>and saw something like a being coming out of my body.
    <br>Immediately it came out of my body, I started vomiting poisonous substances.
    <br>After that, the evangelist instructed me to rise up and walk.
    <br>I then stood up and started walking and jumping.
    <br>I started glorifying the God of T.B. Joshua!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
    <br>So once again, sir, tell us - ever since that encounter - it has been one week now -
    <br>what are the changes that you have seen in your life?
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>After a week, just by looking at me, one can tell that I am fit to carry out any job I want to do.
    <br>Since then, you can see me - I can walk, jump, demonstrate.
    <br>I can bend, stoop, anything at all that you want me to do - I can do it for you.
    <br>Because I know that God has given me the glory of being in His house!
    <br>I love God so much!
    <br>Just give me a second.
    <br>Let me demonstrate for the Almighty God so that the glory of Prophet T.B. Joshua...
    <br>Oh God, you are worthy of my praise!
    <br>In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Wow. Indeed, actions speak louder.
    <br>We can see our father is completely restored to the glory of God.
    <br>Sir, what is your advice to our viewers concerning this New Morning Water
    <br>that God used to heal you and set you free?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world, when you are in a situation like I passed through in life,
    <br>don't cry; just believe in God.
    <br>At the accepted time, God will set you free as He has set me free today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Amen. That's a wonderful word of advice.
    <br>Sir, the lumbar corset - you mean you have no need of it right now?
    <br>This lumbar corset, I don't need it anymore! I throw it away to the glory of God.
    <br>In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>That's just hear a quick word from your wife as well.
    <br>My name is Mrs Vera Ishaka from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>Could you explain to us about the condition that your husband was in before?
    <br>He was having lumbar spondylosis and osteoarthritis, severe back and waist pain,
    <br>inability to lift any heavy object. He could not walk or do anything on his own.
    <br>I used to assist him as a wife and the burden was so much on me - running my business,
    <br>running the home, going everywhere - it was hell then.
    <br>When I came with him, inside the vehicle as you have seen, when I cried out to the evangelist
    <br>to help my husband, the evangelist started ministering the Morning Water on him.
    <br>That is his own experience - that he has changed.
    <br>It happened to him practically but I was there. What I saw was unbelievable.
    <br>I saw him coming out like a new born baby learning how to walk.
    <br>After some time, he started walking to the glory of God.
    <br>Since then, I don't need to bother myself anymore. I only perform my duties as a wife.
    <br>He takes care of himself.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So our mother is saying that her husband is completely healed,
    <br>walking freely to the glory of God since that encounter.
    <br>On your own part, madam, what is your advice to our viewers
    <br>concerning the New Morning Water that God used to revive and restore your husband?
    <br>The New Morning Water, as you have seen, I say, Come, taste and see that miracles are real.
    <br>It is real - very real. I am a witness.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
