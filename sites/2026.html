  <p>    
    <br>Today we shall be on 'Encouraging Words'.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We shall dwell on forgiveness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What is forgiveness?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have meanings for your forgiveness but what my Bible made me to understand;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>when you read your Bible from Genesis to Revelation...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Forgiveness means that God looks at you as if you had never sinned.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God looks at you as if you had never sinned."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When you receive His forgiveness, you are blameless before Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let me put it that way - you are what?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>[Blameless.]
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When you receive His forgiveness, you are blameless before Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God's forgiveness does not sweep your sin under the carpet.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Instead, He completely washes them away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your friend may say, "I forgive you" and tomorrow say, "No..."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>His forgiveness completely washes your sin away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's quickly look at Book of Matthew 5:44.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you..."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Forgiveness paves the way for a harmonious relationship even with your enemy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's quickly look at some bothering, very important questions.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How can I forgive someone who has hurt me deeply?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How can you forgive someone who has hurt you deeply?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Matthew 6:14-15.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How can you forgive someone who has hurt you deeply?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He has answered our question, "How can you forgive someone who has hurt you so deeply?"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you forgive someone who sins against you, your Heavenly Father will forgive you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But if you refuse to forgive others,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>your Heavenly Father will not forgive your sin.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you forgive someone who sins against you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>your Heavenly Father will forgive you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you refuse to forgive others,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>your Father in Heaven will not forgive your sin.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How does this strike your mind?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Being unwilling to forgive shows that you have not understood
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>or benefited from God's forgiveness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>HOW TO FORGIVE SOMEONE WHO HURT YOU DEEPLY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you have been forgiven, that forgiveness will create in you
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>a forgiving heart towards others.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you have been forgiven, that forgiveness will create in you
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>a forgiving heart towards others.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Back to Matthew 5:44,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"... love your enemy, bless those who curse you..."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How does this appear to you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When you love your enemy and pray for those who hate you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>this releases you from the destructive emotions of anger,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>bitterness, revenge and others.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you love your enemy, your neighbour -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>your neighbour could be your enemy or those who don't the same faith with you -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>if you love them, this releases you from the destructive emotions of anger, bitterness and others.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can you see the importance of loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's quickly look at our Lord, Jesus Christ in Luke 23:34.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Then Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing'."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Wow.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Jesus forgave even those who mocked and killed Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We should be more concerned about our offenders and their relationship with God,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and less about nursing our own grudges and self-pity.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is, ill-will.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We should be more concerned about our offenders
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and their relationship with God
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and less about nursing our own grudges and ill-will."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because the person most hurt by unforgiveness is you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As a Christian, when you have something against your fellow brother,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you are not settled, you are disturbed in your heart,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you cannot go to God for any prayer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It is our 'code'.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>To 'decode' you need forgiveness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>An unforgiving attitude not only destroys your relationship but also poisons your soul.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The person most hurt by unforgiveness is you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>not your enemy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It hurts you more than your enemy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"I will not forgive" and you are a Christian - there is no way you can pray.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Even if you pray, you only hear yourself, God will not hear you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>HOW TO FORGIVE SOMEONE WHO HURT YOU DEEPLY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because I know this thing is really bothering you, as I am talking to you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I think this thing really hits.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If it hits you let me see your hand.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It hits!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The person most hurt by unforgiveness is you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Open 1 Peter 3:9.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It says:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Don't repay evil for evil.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Don't retaliate with hurt.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Instead, when people hurt you, pay them back with blessing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is what God has called us to do and He will bless us for it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Ephesians 4:31.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's read together.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let all bitterness - all...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When people say hurtful things about you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God wants us to respond by blessing them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When people say hurtful things about you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God wants us to respond by blessing them."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>HOW TO FORGIVE SOMEONE WHO HURT YOU DEEPLY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Look at the case of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Jesus forgave even those who mocked and killed Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>HOW TO FORGIVE SOMEONE WHO HURT YOU DEEPLY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It is a lesson to everyone of us.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What is the lesson for you and I?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We should be more concerned about our offenders
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and their relationship with God
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and less about nursing our own grudges and self-pity.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I mean, ill-will.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you fail to receive forgiveness and forgive those who sin against you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you also will find yourself in a torture chamber.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>HOW TO FORGIVE SOMEONE WHO HURT YOU DEEPLY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You will find yourself having to be everything, do everything
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and accomplish everything totally on your own strength, ability and intelligence.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And since that is never possible, you will be under high stress and emotional torture.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I mean, you will work hard and struggle greatly but never achieve any progress.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You will run in the morning, afternoon...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Even if you achieve something, before you know it, it is all gone.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You go up and down - this is because of an unforgiving spirit, grudges against your fellow brother.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you become great and you have something against your fellow brother,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>it means that greatness will be used against your fellow brother.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Being unwilling to forgive shows that you have not understood
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>or benefited from God's forgiveness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Then you will also find yourself in a torture chamber.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You will find yourself having to be everything, do everything and
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>accomplish everything totally on your own strength, ability and intelligence.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Who needs forgiveness?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, bow down your head.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>First, forgive yourself before you can forgive those who sin against you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Begin to forgive yourself and forgive those who sin against you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Forgive yourself and forgive those who sin against you.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>It is only by the mercy and compassion of God.
