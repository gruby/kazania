    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
    <br>A Bulgarian Residing in Greece
    <br>My name is Dancho Hadziev.
    <br>I'm from Bulgaria but I reside in Thessaloniki, Greece.
    <br>Today, I have the grace to be here among you
    <br>to share with you my wonderful testimony
    <br>of what God has done for me.
    <br>I want to start from the beginning.
    <br>I was born in Bulgaria in a wealthy family.
    <br>For many years, whatever I wished, I could have.
    <br>As a result, when I went to junior high school,
    <br>I didn't care about anything
    <br>because my mother and father had great names in our howetown.
    <br>When I was in high school, I started a gang and we would harm people.
    <br>Anytime I did bad things,
    <br>when I had finished doing them, I realised that they were not good.
    <br>And yes, I kept doing them over and over again.
    <br>The evil things I did included beating other people,
    <br>taking their money
    <br>and making tattoos all over my body.
    <br>I had this thought that I was God.
    <br>A time came
    <br>when I didn't want to live the life I was living.
    <br>I had a dream since I was very young to become a police officer.
    <br>I entered the police force to become a police officer.
    <br>I must not forget that today is a day of truth.
    <br>When I went to school to become a police officer, things continued the same.
    <br>Although they taught us to be patient and humble and to do things the right away,
    <br>there was always something inside me that provoked me to do the opposite.
    <br>When I finished the school to become a police officer,
    <br>I became a police officer.
    <br>I thought I was the only one and there was nobody else apart from me.
    <br>Because of the authority I had, I made people feel bad.
    <br>In other words, I thought I was God.
    <br>These things did not cause me anything good.
    <br>Many of the people I had done bad things to, sued me as a police officer.
    <br>Higher ranking officers asked me what I was doing but I would not pay them any attention.
    <br>We have been listening to the experience of the brother, who said right from the young age he had joined a gang.
    <br>He was a bully at school and he oppressed people.
    <br>At some point he felt guilty about his bad attitude and he decided to fulfil his dream, that he had
    <br>right from the young age to become a police officer.
    <br>He went to the academy and he was trained as a police officer and later got employed in the police force
    <br>in his country, that is Greece.
    <br>He said that after he had joined the police force, because he was not yet delivered from that evil spirit
    <br>that had been tormenting his life, he still found himself doing the same thing
    <br>he had been doing right from his young age.
    <br>He said even as a police officer, rather than protect life and defend the oppressed, he found himself
    <br>being the one oppressing and bullying people, even as a police officer.
    <br>What experience can he share with the children of God; his attitude, oppression towards people,
    <br>as a police officer?
    <br>Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I will give you an example.
    <br>Whether I was in my uniform or not, I was the same.
    <br>I had the spirit of anger.
    <br>One day, when we had a mission,
    <br>as we were going to arrest someone,
    <br>I was inside the police car.
    <br>A simple citizen passed in front of the car that I was in.
    <br>Anger arose inside me and I rushed out of the police car.
    <br>I couldn't remember what happened next.
    <br>My colleagues told me that I rushed out of the car
    <br>and beat the man in a way that nobody had ever done before.
    <br>Afterwards, I realised that I did something very bad asking myself why I had done that.
    <br>I asked myself why I did this when I was supposed to be an example to others.
    <br>The day came when I was called in to see the Chief of Police.
    <br>He told me that he wanted to tell me something.
    <br>He said that it was either I stopped what I was doing or they would sack me.
    <br>It is bad for a police officer to be sacked; so, he should resign instead.
    <br>However, I didn’t do that.
    <br>Instead, I got angry and grabbed him by his neck.
    <br>I told him I didn't care what he would do, that I had money and everything I wanted
    <br>and that he should rather perish.
    <br>The time came when I was at home and I received a sack letter from the police force.
    <br>We have just heard from the brother who said that as a result of this spirit of anger in him, he got to a point
    <br>where he oppressed the citizen of his country while being on a mission to arrest somebody.
    <br>On their way, an ordinary citizen passed in front of their vehicle.
    <br>He rushed of a car in anger, grabbed that man, and beat him mercilessly.
    <br>He said that he didn't remember what he had done to this man, which proves that an evil spirit was behind
    <br>that anger.
    <br>It was his colleagues that told him of that great offence he committed beating this man mercilessly.
    <br>As a result, he was called to his superior in the police force.
    <br>They advised him saying that what he was doing was bad for the image of the police force.
    <br>They gave him a choice to stop or be sacked.
    <br>Instead of feeling remorse or guilt for what he had done, he became angry; he grabbed the superior officer,
    <br>he shook him and told him that he had money and he could do anything.
    <br>Few days later he received a sack letter from the police force.
    <br>When they gave me the sack letter, I was very unhappy.
    <br>So, since I already had a bad reputation, I made the decision to continue the same lifestyle.
    <br>I got involved with the mafia.
    <br>Because I knew many people in the police force, I could do whatever I wanted.
    <br>I started having friends who were smoking cannabis and drinking.
    <br>So, I was doing the same thing as a young man in the world.
    <br>I got very frustrated with what I was doing but couldn't stop it.
    <br>Every time I did something evil, I would tell myself that it was the last time.
    <br>I couldn't stop; I would do it again and again
    <br>Many times, I tried on my own to stop smoking,
    <br>drinking alcohol and the lifestyle I was living
    <br>because I knew that that lifestyle was not normal.
    <br>Something inside of me was telling me that there was a plan for me.
    <br>We heard from the brother who said that he always had felt he could not get out of his problem on his own.
    <br>Can you tell us what happened that led to your deliverance?
    <br>Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>One day, when I was at home, a man from Bulgaria that I didn’t know, came to visit me.
    <br>He started talking to me about Jesus Christ but I told him that I already knew Him.
    <br>I told him to tell me something new and he asked me to sit down and said he would.
    <br>As we were talking, he introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>This man was very patient with me because I was behaving badly.
    <br>Through his mobile phone, he opened Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He started showing me videos of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The first time I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua, I wondered, “Is this African man healing people?
    <br>He must be a fraudster”.
    <br>However something within me was telling me that I should not talk like that
    <br>because if truly God had covered him with His blood, I would be in trouble.
    <br>So, I stopped talking in that way to the man who was sitting beside me.
    <br>Since that day, I started watching Emmanuel TV all day long.
    <br>Sunday came and it was a live service at The SCOAN.
    <br>Within me, I decided to dedicate the day to watch Emmanuel TV and see what was happening.
    <br>As I was watching, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for people.
    <br>I was thinking to myself, ‘Lord, if You are truly there in this Church,
    <br>as this man is praying, if  You are the Healer, Deliverer, Redeemer, and everything,
    <br>help me to believe this and see that it’s true’.
    <br>Then, I received the answer.
    <br>Since that time, my life changed!
    <br>Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>My life changed and I stopped smoking.
    <br>I will start from the smaller things that the Lord has done for me.
    <br>Before, I was a very big gambler.
    <br>I stopped gambling.
    <br>I stopped smoking cannabis, drinking alcohol and doing anything that had to do with the world.
    <br>However, I will tell you the greatest thing that the Lord has done for me.
    <br>Because of all the things I was doing, I had many court cases.
    <br>The Lord made all these cases disappear!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together for the miracle working God, for what He has done in the life of this brother!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>In this way I received the greatest miracle.
    <br>They called me from the police force, asking me to come back and speak with them.
    <br>I went there and was re-hired for the same job!
    <br>Mr Dancho Hadzhiev
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I am now a special agent and the head of my team in the police force.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Put your hands together louder for the miracle working God!
    <br>I know that this testimony have lifted your faith to another level.
    <br>Brother standing right before us was deep into the world.
    <br>This thing cost him a lot.
    <br>It cost him his job, his reputation in the society, he was affected both emotionally and physically.
    <br>But in the moment Jesus Christ got into his life; He healed and delivered him completely and effectually.
    <br>Put your hands together louder for the miracle working God!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Our brother said something; a comment he made - "What can an African brother do to you?"
    <br>Now, that God Almighty has used His Prophet to deliver you and set you free -
    <br>what can you say about the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>I want to tell people all over the world who are hearing this testimony today
    <br>who have spoken negative words about this ministry and Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to go and ask for forgiveness from the Lord.
    <br>Because Prophet T.B. Joshua is a true prophet and a real man of God.
    <br>What is your advice to millions of people that are listening to you right now?
    <br>What advise do you have for them all?
    <br>My advice to those in the same situation I once was in or facing another problem -
    <br>don’t run away from God but run to Him.
    <br>They have to go through this situation with God.
