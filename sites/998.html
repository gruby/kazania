  <p>    
    <br>What a blessed day!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We had to stop the testimony but I will only listen to just one
    <br>that will usher us to the next blessing.
    <br>I saw many prophetic words - that was last Sunday.
    <br>A lot.
    <br>That is the way God moves.
    <br>And when you are called or you are touched or you have a message from God,
    <br>here is message, here is solution.
    <br>What is not done well is not done at all, and God is always complete.
    <br>Hallelujah, thank you. Let's listen.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>There is a young lady there, at the back of the sister wearing spectacles.
    <br>At the back there.
    <br>A very young lady.
    <br>It has been a problem for you. You have been bedwetting.
    <br>Come, don't be shy.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I said you have been bedwetting.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What a beautiful girl.
    <br>This thing has been disgracing you, even when you were in school.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Yet, the thing refuses to leave you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Come on! Leave her!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Out!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I want to destroy her!
    <br>How?
    <br>She will never get married.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>She has a bright destiny.
    <br>What else have you done to her?
    <br>What have you pushed her to do?
    <br>She is my daughter.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I cause her to bedwet.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am the ancestral spirit.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>Through dreams.
    <br>Man of God, the prophecy you gave to my daughter is one hundred percent correct.
    <br>She has been bedwetting since childhood up to this age, while in university.
    <br>This has made her not to relax in school; she's always on and off.
    <br>Each time this thing happened, I would cry.
    <br>I wouldn't know what to do.
    <br>I thank God today that her case has been opened.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>Man of God, what you said about me is true.
    <br>I have been bedwetting since childbirth.
    <br>It has been disgracing me wherever I go.
    <br>It doesn't allow me to go out.
    <br>Wherever I go, it disgraces me.
    <br>You said what?
    <br>Wherever I go, it disgraces me.
    <br>I can't go out.
    <br>Sometimes I think I have to be awake so I won't disgrace myself or litter the bed.
    <br>How do you cope in the university when you are bedwetting all the time?
    <br>Sometimes, my roommates will be -
    <br>I am on the top bunk, when I urinate, it will touch the person below me.
    <br>So, the urine touches them?
    <br>Yes, sometimes, I have to sleep on the floor so I will not disgrace myself.
    <br>I will wake up very early to clean the floor and wash my clothes.
    <br>She said she sleeps on the floor and wakes up early to clean the urine.
    <br>So, don't worry, it's over!
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>The coming Sunday, you will come out to tell the world what happened to you.
    <br>OK, it's alright.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Today is the coming Sunday we talked about.
    <br>The whole thing happened last Sunday.
    <br>You can see the move of God.
    <br>The whole thing comes directly by vision.
    <br>Like she was called, she came out and immediately,
    <br>without touching her, stretching hand, you can see that demon cried out.
    <br>Behind every situation you are in, lies demon.
    <br>Demon is responsible.
    <br>Demon is the cause.
    <br>Let's hear from her.
    <br>After the prayer last Sunday, what happened?
    <br>Yes, hear from her.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Sochima Ukpaka.
    <br>I am a student of Godfrey Okoye University, a private institution.
    <br>I am in 300 level and I am studying psychology.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave to me last week was true.
    <br>I was sitting right there.
    <br>Then he said, there is a young lady here, you have the problem of bedwetting.
    <br>You are seated at the back of the woman wearing spectacles.
    <br>First of all, my mind was not there.
    <br>Something tapped me, "This woman in front of you is wearing spectacles".
    <br>I said, "Jesus, it is me!" - I ran out.
    <br>This issue of bedwetting has been disturbing me.
    <br>It has caused me so much pain for the past twenty years.
    <br>Since my secondary school days I have known that "Yes, this is bedwetting".
    <br>This situation caused me not to stay in a boarding school during my secondary school
    <br>though I wanted a boarding school but my mom, as the kid I was,
    <br>she said, "'No, you will not go to a boarding school".
    <br>I asked her, "Why?"; she said, "That is known to me; don't worry".
    <br>With time, I grew up. When I was in SS 1, it was then that I understood what bedwetting was.
    <br>During that time, the issue of bedwetting disgraced me severely.
    <br>It did not disgrace me as much as when I entered the university
    <br>because I was under my mom's care, and she would try to cover me up, no matter what it was.
    <br>The shame was not there as compared to at the university level.
    <br>When I was seeking for admission, my mom was looking for a university near to us,
    <br>just because of this issue of bedwetting.
    <br>Then came a time that it stopped; I was not experiencing it.
    <br>So she said, "Okay, you can live in the boarding, in the university".
    <br>When I went back to school, in my first year, this situation disgraced me on several occasions.
    <br>In a room, there were four students.
    <br>In the boarding school - some people who know how we live in a boarding school -
    <br>there is a place where two or three stay in a room but this one we were four.
    <br>That day because I came in newly, I was in the up bunk.
    <br>When I was in the up bunk, I was sleeping.
    <br>I just slept off.
    <br>Then I bedwetted.
    <br>It touched the person who was down.
    <br>Then, another case was on broad daylight like this.
    <br>I just came back from school, and I was sitting down on the bed of another person.
    <br>I just dozed off; within five minutes, I had bedwetted on someone else's bed.
    <br>When I woke up, I started crying, "What will I do now?
    <br>If this person comes back and sees this, what will she tell me?"
    <br>In order to be clever, I took the bed up to my own side,
    <br>took my own bed to her's and washed her bed sheet.
    <br>Then, after I washed it, when she came back, she said, "Why did you wash my bed sheet? Did I beg you?"
    <br>I told her, "No, I was drinking Fanta and mistakenly it poured.
    <br>So I didn't want her trouble, that is why I washed it".
    <br>I thought that was okay.
    <br>But often, it started occurring to the extent that they knew about it.
    <br>Whenever all these things happened, I would run to my mom.
    <br>She would tell me, "Continue praying, God will hear your prayers".
    <br>I would say, "Praying? Since you have been praying for me, nothing has happened".
    <br>She was telling me, "Continue praying, have that faith".
    <br>It disgraced me in my cousin's place in the village.
    <br>It disgraced me in many places in this life. I couldn't go out.
    <br>In order not to be cleaning up, because it is not every day one would be washing one's bed sheets -
    <br>because people around would say, "This girl is so clean; she is washing her bed sheets every day".
    <br>They would feel like you are so clean, but they would not know the situation you are passing through.
    <br>But even if you wash the bed sheets, the bed itself - even if you take it outside for the sun to touch it,
    <br>the smell sometimes would come out, and what would you tell them?
    <br>So it resulted in me sleeping on the floor.
    <br>I started sleeping on the floor and I would wake up as early as anything,
    <br>just to wash and clean up.
    <br>Sometimes for people not to be suspicious of what was happening,
    <br>I would put it into a plastic bag and take it back home
    <br>for my mom to wash, to help me and wash it so that I would not be disgraced.
    <br>Could you share with us your experiences and what happened till now?
    <br>Daddy, after the prayer, I went back to the hotel room.
    <br>I was like, "Are you serious? Just like that? I'm not sure it is true".
    <br>Then I went home. My mom said, "Have faith, it is done", and I said, "Okay, let's see".
    <br>I took six sachets of water that night.
    <br>Normally, I wouldn't take water or anything from 5 or 6 pm.
    <br>So I took water and drank all and made sure that I was full enough.
    <br>I said to myself, "Okay, let's try it".
    <br>I went to bed; I just laid down.
    <br>Normally, even if I wanted to pray or do something,
    <br>sometimes I would sleep off, or something would happen.
    <br>So that day, I brought out my faith bracelet and said, "How will I start now?"
    <br>I brought out my faith bracelet and said, "Okay, they are doing like this" - I started meditating
    <br>I was counting, and I asked myself, "What will I say?"
    <br>I remembered that they said, "Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me and give me more of You".
    <br>I was like, "Okay, let's start with that one now".
    <br>I started counting it.
    <br>As I was doing that, I just slept off and  woke up around 9.
    <br>Normally, I had to wake up like four or five times.
    <br>During those processes of waking up, I would be tired of sleeping and say, "Let me not sleep,
    <br>let me just be awake so that if the urine comes, I will just go and urinate".
    <br>But this time I did not wake up; I just slept and woke up without bedwetting on the bed.
    <br>And since then, for the past seven days, I have never bedwetted, I have been sleeping.
    <br>And before now, it happened every day?
    <br>Before now, I bedwetted every day.
    <br>I got used to it. I was like, "When I wake up, I'll just wash".
    <br>It was a normal thing; that was it.
    <br>But when I woke up that morning, I was like, "Hey, let me go and wash it. It is morning now".
    <br>So I woke up, looked around, "I'm dry!
    <br>Okay, let me check the floor, maybe I was turning and urinated on the floor".
    <br>I checked the floor, smelled my clothes and was like, "Ah, this is true!"
    <br>So I am free indeed.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Being a young girl, she has never experienced this kind of thing.
    <br>They have gone to many places.
    <br>Okay, let's see. Where will I start?
    <br>This is to tell you that when it is your time, or when you meet a man God sent to you,
    <br>whether you believe or not, it will definitely happen
    <br>but that your belief will only help you to maintain that God send the man to give you.
    <br>When the prophecy concerning her was given, she looked back and said, "Are they calling me?"
    <br>She was not here because of that situation, she just believed that it was a normal way life
    <br>and it would continue like that - it was a different thing she was here for.
    <br>But even after the deliverance, she began to ask herself,
    <br>"Does it mean I'm free? Is that how things happen?"
    <br>When you meet a man that God sent to set you free or deliver you,
    <br>it may not be a man, it may be an object.
    <br>You know God can use anything, not necessarily a human being.
    <br>An object - it could be water or anything.
    <br>Whether you believe it or not.
    <br>You may not believe but it will happen but to now maintain that blessing, your belief is important.
    <br>This is what youths need now to come back to God.
    <br>Youths - their hearts are so hardened.
    <br>The young people today - this is what they need to come back to God.
    <br>When you tell them about Jesus and you are very eloquent,
    <br>they will tell you they have studied it in the university.
    <br>But they want to see what they have not and what they cannot study in university happens to them.
    <br>What happened now?
    <br>Call youths and begin to preach about Jesus, about God.
    <br>They will tell you, "Look, we have studied all this in school".
    <br>Those who have not studied this in school, they will say, "No, I can take a book and read about it".
    <br>They want to experience what they have not studied in university and what they cannot study in the college.
    <br>They are yearning for a new thing, a new wave, a new direction, a new course.
    <br>This is why it is difficult for us to change or tame our youths or mentor our children.
    <br>These days, you cannot mentor your children. You go this way, they go that way
    <br>because all you are telling them, they know better than you.
    <br>Man of God, I want to thank you for allowing God to use you to deliver me
    <br>because I felt like all hope was lost; I felt isolated.
    <br>I didn't want to come close to people.
    <br>I would be like, "If you knew the problem I am passing through,
    <br>would you like to be my friend and the rest?"
    <br>I felt that this was my world, that that was how I had to face it.
    <br>Can we ask you one question and I want you to be free and tell us.
    <br>While you were going through this problem,
    <br>what were you actually thinking up to do with your life?
    <br>They are problems that your parents cannot help you, nobody can help you with.
    <br>In this situation, you have many things you keep to yourself
    <br>which you did not want to tell anybody and you were always thinking about.
    <br>What were you thinking to do with your life while going through this problem? Tell us.
    <br>So many times I felt like committing suicide.
    <br>I felt like, "Let me end it all.
    <br>How can I come out in front of people and tell them I'm bedwetting?"
    <br>Even when suitors came, I would be like, "Are you people serious?
    <br>If you knew what I am, that I am bedwetting,
    <br>would you want a bedwetter as your wife or anything?"
    <br>I just felt like committing suicide so many times.
    <br>I've tried to do it in front of my mom, and she would tell me, "Stop it; it is not the end of the world".
    <br>It's over. That's why we are asking you questions; we are not making jest.
    <br>We are happy with you, and we want to learn.
    <br>Did you ever think that one day, you will meet a man in your future
    <br>that will accept you with that bedwetting?
    <br>As beautiful as you are, a man will accept to marry you with that bedwetting? Tell us.
    <br>No.!
    <br>Why?
    <br>I concluded that I would not get married; I didn't want to get married.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because I feel like it is a shame - who will accept me, no matter what it is?
    <br>Will you rise up and give glory to God.
    <br>Give glory to God.
    <br>When she was sharing the testimony, you'll just look at it, she's a bedwetter, God has healed her.
    <br>You never knew that it is more than that.
    <br>Inside her, she was planning to commit suicide.
    <br>She said...
    <br>And all this, she kept away from her mom.
    <br>With that, she could never be an obedient child to her mom
    <br>because she felt there was something a parent cannot solve.
    <br>"This problem - my parent cannot solve it." - this is where disobedience comes.
    <br>"Ah, I have this problem, who can solve it? Nobody!"
    <br>Definitely the thought of not obeying your parents.
    <br>Give thanks to God for this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>There were many things she was keeping them away from you.
    <br>She is right.
    <br>Because she thought since you could not help her...
    <br>Okay, what else again?
    <br>You saw her then as an obedient child, she tried to be obedient
    <br>but she had a thorn in her flesh which no one could...
    <br>If it is cancer - no problem. Nobody will know, until it is very serious.
    <br>But this one, you can't keep it. For how long will you keep it?
    <br>All the students knew about it.
    <br>If you keep it away from the man you want to marry, after you get to the house of the man,
    <br>one week or two weeks, the man will know.
    <br>So let's hear from you: What message do you have for the viewers all over the world?
    <br>I advise the viewers all over the world to have faith.
    <br>You are now preaching faith?
    <br>Glory be to God. She said you should have faith.
    <br>A faithless generation now has faith.
    <br>She said, have faith.
    <br>I preached to them to have faith because as I was made to understand, joy is the fruit of faith.
    <br>So have faith; God is the God of the last hour - no matter the time or when you feel, all hope is lost.
    <br>Just believe in God, always trust in Him; He will do it.
    <br>He is the One who makes the impossible to be possible.
    <br>So just have faith in Him.
    <br>And to the youth out there:
    <br>There are so many situations which you are passing through.
    <br>You feel it is the end of the world.
    <br>It is not the end of the world; run to God.
    <br>He is the only true Father that never fails.
    <br>Thank you, clap for her.
    <br>Mama, are you happy?
    <br>Yes, I am very happy.
    <br>Now, you are having a child.
    <br>Before, she belonged to someone, not you.
    <br>She was a child you could lose then in the past suddenly.
    <br>But now, here you have a child.
    <br>Let me ask you a question: When you knew that your daughter was going through all this situation,
    <br>what was your effort to rescue her?
    <br>What effort?
    <br>Tell us, just in a nut shell.
    <br>At what time did you know about it?
    <br>And at the same time, did she actually try to keep this challenge away from you
    <br>or was she open to let you know any time this situation happened?
    <br>Was she open to you? Tell us.
    <br>My name is Mrs Ukpaka.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I discovered this when she entered secondary school, because at that time,
    <br>she was supposed to be free, not to be bedwetting, so when I now noticed that
    <br>I went closer to her and asked her some questions.
    <br>She started telling me that, in fact, she didn't like what she was seeing.
    <br>That it was better for her to die.
    <br>So I told her that it was not the best to...
    <br>She said it is better for her to do what?
    <br>To die.
    <br>Okay, she has told you this.
    <br>That was what made me to even go closer to her.
    <br>So I never allowed her to stay alone.
    <br>So you knew that she was nursing to die.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>When I noticed it, I took her to the hospital for the first time to check her system.
    <br>They said that nothing was wrong with her.
    <br>I went to many places for prayers and there was no solution.
    <br>I now said that I must come here with her
    <br>because I know that this is the only place where I will have a solution to that problem
    <br>and that was why I brought her.
    <br>God is good all the time!
    <br>Thank you. Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>While you are sitting down, wherever you are, viewers all over the world,
    <br>begin to compare your situation to this lady's situation.
    <br>What kind of situation are you having that can be compared with her former situation?
    <br>This is how faith comes.
    <br>Many of you think you have to read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
    <br>Faith is natural.
    <br>Immediately you realise that God is reliable, with what you are seeing now, He is reliable.
    <br>This shows Jesus is reliable.
    <br>Jesus is what?
    <br>He is reliable.
    <br>Immediately you agree and believe Jesus is reliable, faith grows spontaneously, naturally.
    <br>It comes just like that and you begin to build on that.
    <br>So you need to now establish it - "Ah, Jesus is reliable, I can rely on Him. He will never fail".
    <br>No matter the situation you have, you are looking for faith.
    <br>"How will I get faith. I will memorise the Bible.
    <br>I will read my Bible from Genesis, go to church every day."
    <br>Yes, good.
    <br>It is a good idea.
    <br>But one of the shortest ways to have that faith in God is the one we have just witnessed now.
    <br>You have heard, you have seen
    <br>and the lady is confessing what she went through
    <br>and you saw how she was spotted and she came out.
    <br>And immediately, "By the name Jesus Christ, be delivered!", she screamed, "Hii!"
    <br>Without touching her - immediately.
    <br>Now, it is over!
    <br>When you now sit down and meditate over and over and turn it over and over in your heart...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Turn it over and over in your heart".
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>I say, what you hear now, what you have seen now, turn it over and over again in your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Yes, you have to.
    <br>Now you have seen what happened, it is time now to turn it over and over again in your hearts.
    <br>Here faith comes.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>Begin to turn it over and over.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Begin to turn it over and over in your heart".
    <br>Begin to turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>In your heart - that is, in a natural way.
    <br>We call it thinking but it is not thinking - meditation
    <br>because when you think, thinking is here - meditation is above thinking.
    <br>Faith prevails over thinking processing.
    <br>If you now use the word 'thinking', you are not right.
    <br>Faith prevails over thinking processing.
    <br>Begin to meditate over and over again in your heart.
    <br>How do we think?
    <br>The word 'thinking' naturally is "I am poor. Will my prayers be answered today?
    <br>Will this man discover me in the midst of people?
    <br>Will this man fetch me out just in the same way he fetched this lady?
    <br>What time are we leaving here today?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I still feel the pain.
    <br>Will the man pray for me?
    <br>But I'm feeling hungry now. If I leave here, somebody will take over my seat.
    <br>I will not leave and I'm pressed now. I will endure".
    <br>These are the thinking.
    <br>Thinking means, what we don't mean.
    <br>Often, you don't mean it. By the time I meet you, you change because it is not from your heart.
    <br>Oftentimes, what we think, we don't mean it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Oftentimes, what we think, we don't mean it".
    <br>But if you are able to meditate over an issue, you mean it because it is from your heart.
    <br>What is going on in your heart now is thinking.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "What is going on in your heart now is thinking".
    <br>Your mind is floating; it is floating.
    <br>By the time I want to pray for you, you say, "Is he going to fall me?"
    <br>You will not say it out, but in your mind.
    <br>Immediately I face you, because you normally see the way people are rolling on the floor
    <br>and fall down, and you know they will be looking at you at home...
    <br>You say, some people just believe that once you fall, you are a witch or wizard
    <br>whereas there is nothing like that.
    <br>People just believe once you fall, "Ah!".
    <br>But you know when you fall down, people will say "Ah, we saw when they were delivering you.
    <br>We didn't know that you are the cause of our problems".
    <br>Many people are here today, immediately I get to them, this is the way you see them standing.
    <br>In their heart they say, "Is he going to fall me?"
    <br>So that is thinking.
    <br>As we are talking now, people that have God seem to lose it again.
    <br>A lot of things are going on in your heart.
    <br>If you don't believe, you just think everything is money, money, money.
    <br>"How can somebody give me something like this? No!"
    <br>People lost God because they believe that they can't get anything -
    <br>"be healed!" - without money exchange.
    <br>You want God back? Give freely.
    <br>God is looking for people that will give freely.
    <br>Are you ready to give freely?
    <br>Even though you don't have, can you give freely?
    <br>Yes, give freely and see what will happen, your life will change suddenly.
    <br>Before you have abundant in your pocket - you don't have now - you can still give freely.
    <br>Soon you will have abundance.
    <br>We lost God because we believe we cannot give without receiving money.
    <br>Man of God, I want to beg for something.
    <br>Please, I need one fruit.
    <br>Not only you - you and your mummy should come and take a fruit.
    <br>No! If that will make her to follow Jesus fully, in fact I will ask her to carry the whole basket here.
    <br>As I will give you anything for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>She is not the one I delivered oo!
    <br>She now went to carry a fruit. Okay, carry it and go.
    <br>Okay, thank you!

    <br>A better way to pay your tithes is to learn how to give out there free.
    <br>You know them - those who need what you have, give them freely.
    <br>You are paying your tithes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, every good thing the Lord has given you,
    <br>use it to bless and care for those who are in need of what you have.
    <br>Those who are in need of what you have, you know them.
    <br>The poor, needy, widow, and those whom you are better - help them.
    <br>Like I have said, mere smile.
    <br>Just say to your neighbour, "I love you".
    <br>What a wonderful blessing.
    <br>And this must come from your heart.
    <br>When I say neighbour- it could be your enemy, those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Say to them, "I love you" with all your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I love you with all my heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I love you with all my heart.
    <br>Again.
    <br>I love you with all my heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>I love you with all my heart.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>I love you with all my heart.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>I love you with all my heart.
    <br>Love with all your heart.
    <br>It delivers one, it blesses one, it heals the wound of one.
    <br>We are not talking of fleshly love.
    <br>Say, "I love you with all my heart".
    <br>If I love you with all my heart, your wound will be healed.
    <br>You will feel the presence of God immediately.
    <br>Can you say to your neighbour, "I love you".
    <br>I love you.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>I love you.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>I love you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So can you rise up, and let me bless you with this language.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>If you now go out and say "I love you" and it is not from your heart, you are raining curses on yourself.
    <br>It is a message, and you should live by this message.
    <br>Are you ready to receive the word 'love' in your heart?
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When you love your neighbour with all your heart, you love God.
    <br>When you help your neighbour with all your heart, you help God.
    <br>When you greet your neighbour with all your heart, you greet God.
    <br>When you help your neighbour with all your heart, you help God.
    <br>You have been helping people for so long.
    <br>God was not aware because this help was not from your heart.
    <br>You can give trillion dollars, billion pounds to people as a way of help,
    <br>but if it is not from your heart, you are wasting your time.
    <br>If your worship is not from your heart, you are wasting your time.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>When you greet your neighbour with all your heart, you greet God.
    <br>When you help your neighbour with all your heart, you help God.
    <br>If you have being helping your neighbour with all your heart, God will help you, you will be helped.
    <br>Help; you will be helped.
    <br>Show mercy and you will receive mercy.
    <br>Show kindness and you will receive kindness.
    <br>You have been doing this, but not with all your heart.
    <br>This is why you keep asking yourself, "Look, I help people.
    <br>I do this. I trained this man, I helped this man, I paid the loan for this man.
    <br>I paid school fees for this man, I helped this man, I trained this man".
    <br>But at the end, it was opposite to you because all these were not from your heart.
    <br>You were doing them for the reason known to you.
    <br>Viewers, listen.
    <br>Just say to your neighbour - your neighbour could be your enemy,
    <br>those who do not share the same faith with you -
    <br>say to your neighbour, "I love you".
    <br>This must be with all your heart.
    <br>If you love your neighbour with all your heart, you love God.
    <br>If you love God, what happens, what comes next?
    <br>God will be your strength, your Provider.
    <br>If God becomes your Provider, what a blessing!
    <br>I command your heart to receive the word 'love'.
    <br>Love enough.
    <br>When you have this love we are talking about,
    <br>you will always see your contribution to others as God's responsibility.
    <br>Whatever you give, you give it to God.
    <br>Someone runs to you, someone is in need of help, you say, "Ah, this man is not a Christian".
    <br>And he is in need of help!
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>What are you reading in the Bible?
    <br>You need to move above your senses.
    <br>It is mere senses.
    <br>Tit for tat.
    <br>What is the message you are taking home now?
    <br>I love you.
    <br>Are you going to say that to your enemy?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Those who do not share the same faith with you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>I love you.
    <br>Oh my God! Clap for Jesus!
