    <br>I think I need to chip in a word, before we go for healing.
    <br>Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings
    <br>are hindered by the way and manner we go about the issue of money.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings
    <br>are hindered today by the way and manner we go about the issue of money.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>No one can give money from his heart before healing.
    <br>Anybody that gives money before healing is giving that money on condition -
    <br>heal me, have money.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Healing and God's blessings should not be exchanged with money.
    <br>When we give freely as we have been given freely,
    <br>God will raise His people to bless us abundantly.
    <br>Anything that does not come from the heart is a sin.
    <br>If someone gives money before healing, he is not giving it from his heart;
    <br>he is giving it to receive healing.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Anything that is not from the heart is a sin.
    <br>This is why it is so difficult to receive healing and deliverance today.
    <br>All these - Gods blessings, are hindered by the manner and way we go about money.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>South Korea Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>SOUTH KOREA CRUSADE
    <br>WITH TB JOSHUA
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Whatever you give me now, before prayer, is not from your heart.
    <br>Whatever you give me now, before your healing, is not from your heart.
    <br>and anything that is not from the heart is a sin.
    <br>It means, you give me sin, tribulation, sickness - you are giving me affliction.
    <br>The Spirit of God comes on the scene as Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his hand to pray for this lady.
    <br>Remember, where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place
    <br>and healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings are just like breathing.
    <br>I am very, very sure, if I had collected money from her, she would not receive.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>She is under the influence of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Rise and walk.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>The South Korea Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>What a miracle! After receiving prayers from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>this lady begins to vomit out every poisonous substance from her body
    <br>which has been troubling her system for a very long time.
    <br>When Jesus comes into our lives, he brushes away our past and gives birth to our glorious future.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>She waves her hands in appreciation for the mighty miracle she had just received.
