    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Wise Man Daniel moves through the congregation praying for the people in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>As he ministers prayer to the people, every garment of darkness in their lives are removed in Jesus' name.
    <br>Jesus came to preserve us, to heal us, to deliver us and save us.
    <br>Get ready to see and understand that there is more to life than meets the ordinary eye,
    <br>as you watch Wise Man Daniel's encounter with this man.
    <br>Deliverance Time
    <br>- Who are you?
    <br>- Chief priest.
    <br>- Chief priest?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- What have you done to him?
    <br>- Destroyed him.
    <br>- Destroyed him?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Can you explain how you destroyed him?
    <br>We ruined his business. We ruined his marriage.
    <br>We just finished him. By the way, he is supposed to die today.
    <br>- He's supposed to...
    <br>- Die today.
    <br>Why is he here? We have an arrangement.
    <br>Speak louder!
    <br>I'm speaking. I'm a chief priest, okay?
    <br>He is supposed to come home today.
    <br>- You're a chief priest?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>What have you done to the family?
    <br>We destroyed their businesses, there is no progress there.
    <br>What have you done to the marriage?
    <br>I sent the wife away with the daughter.
    <br>- You sent the wife away with the daughter.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>And people that owe him - we removed his memory.
    <br>He doesn't remember where his money or any of his wealth is.
    <br>Those who owe him - you have removed his memory
    <br>so that he would not be able to remember those who are owing him?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Why did you do that?
    <br>Oh! He is a bit smart. So we have to be taking his memory as he ages, you know.
    <br>Every year we remove a 12 months memory capacity from his brain.
    <br>Why?
    <br>We need to slow him down.
    <br>What kind of business does he do? What kind of business do you destroy?
    <br>He has a big supermarket, a popular supermarket. We destroyed it.
    <br>He has a good pharmacy, a household pharmacy. We finished it.
    <br>By the way, if he thinks he will continue to run that business,
    <br>if he is not going to die, we will send him to prison
    <br>for still trying to overturn our decision.
    <br>But anyway, he is supposed to die.
    <br>When is he supposed to die?
    <br>He is supposed to die today. It is the birthday of his daughter.
    <br>So he has to celebrate her birthday over there while we watch what happens.
    <br>He is supposed to commit suicide that is why we brought him home.
    <br>We didn't want him to come in cargo.
    <br>Where was he living before?
    <br>He stays in Botswana.
    <br>- And you brought him home?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Why did you bring him home? Why?
    <br>We don't want him to come in cargo.
    <br>We want him to die at home because we need fresh blood.
    <br>- I've got to go.
    <br>- You've got to go?
    <br>I've got to go.
    <br>Okay, you say he is supposed to die today. Why did you allow him to come in here?
    <br>See, I don't know. I think he tricked us.
    <br>That's another thing - he plays smart.
    <br>He plays smart?
    <br>He agreed he is coming home to die.
    <br>When he got to Lagos, he got stuck in Lagos.
    <br>He is supposed to be in the village by now but he keeps on playing the game.
    <br>Okay, and he is finally here. Do you know where he is now?
    <br>This place is not good for us.
    <br>This place is not good for you people?
    <br>It is not good for us.
    <br>Why do you say this place is not good for you people?
    <br>It is a one way house. When you come in, you don't come out.
    <br>Why did you say, it is a place you come in and don't go out? Why?
    <br>We can only see footsteps coming in. Where did you send them?
    <br>Okay, who are the people that come in and cannot go out? Who are the people?
    <br>All the mermaids, the kings and queens of the world under the ground.
    <br>All the mermaids, queens and kings of the underworld?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When they come in here, they don't go out.
    <br>Yes, where do you keep them?
    <br>Let's just have an agreement and understanding and let me just go, okay.
    <br>Okay, why is it that when they come in here, they don't go out? What is wrong?
    <br>That's the strange thing about this house.
    <br>That's the strange thing about this house.
    <br>But one day we are going to find out. There must be a way out.
    <br>Okay, now you have come in here, are you sure, you are going back?
    <br>For me? That's why I said let's have a gentleman's agreement, okay.
    <br>We will leave him to you. It's okay.
    <br>Okay, the same thing that happened to other mermaids and evil spirits will happen to you now.
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You wicked chief priest - out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire all over your body! Fire!
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You wicked chief priest - out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>You are free. Rise up!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>What are you doing here?
    <br>I'm just wondering.
    <br>You said?
    <br>What happened to you? You just stood up from the floor. What happened to you?
    <br>Shame! Oh, shame!
    <br>How?
    <br>What happened to you? You don't know what happened to you?
    <br>You mean...
    <br>Where were you sitting before?
    <br>I was sitting down there.
    <br>Then what happened to you? Why are you here?
    <br>Okay, you said you are the chief priest in the body.
    <br>Priest?
    <br>Chief priest. Not only priest but a chief priest in the body.
    <br>No.
    <br>You said so now.
    <br>I'm not a priest.
    <br>You said you're out to destroy this body and the entire family.
    <br>Oh God! How?..
    <br>You just said it now.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>You also you said he was in Botswana and you brought him back, that he is to die today.
    <br>Today is the birthday of the daughter and you are meant to die today.
    <br>Yes, I stay in Botswana.
    <br>But you said you brought him back to kill him.
    <br>No, I just came on my own.
    <br>You said you brought him to kill him, that today is the birthday of the daughter.
    <br>When is the birthday of your daughter?
    <br>Today.
    <br>You said you want to kill him. You destroyed all his businesses.
    <br>He has a pharmaceutical company and you destroyed it.
    <br>You didn't say that?
    <br>No, my business is having problems but I can't destroy what I am building up.
    <br>You are delivered, sir. You are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm free.
    <br>THE SCOAN: Why Demons HATE This Church!!!
    <br>Thank you, so you have listened to everything.
    <br>You listened to what has happened?
    <br>He received a phone call, he never believed all this would happen.
    <br>But everything he said in the spirit
    <br>reflects what has happened to him in the physical world.
    <br>Now he is here today.
    <br>Now let us see everything he said. He is now going to take it one by one.
    <br>Because he didn't know what he was saying but all what he said
    <br>was actually what was happening in his life.
    <br>So tell me now what was happening in your life.
    <br>If I call my father here to explain what is happening in his life,
    <br>you will see that those things cannot just come from Heaven - it is from the pit of hell.
    <br>If those things are from the pit of hell, it means definitely, you are possesed.
    <br>And to go straight to the root of your problem is to deliver you from the demon.
    <br>If you are not delivered from the demon and you are healed, we are just joking.
    <br>Let me tell you one thing.
    <br>If the demon is inside a person, and you are healed,
    <br>now it is like somebody who has gonorrhea,
    <br>but as a result, the wife also has gonorrhea.
    <br>But the husband comes here, "Sir, I have gonorrhea, heal me".
    <br>If the man is healed of that gonorrhea, he will still go and meet the wife that has gonorrhea at home.
    <br>And the moment he meets that woman for affection, he will contact another gonorrhea.
    <br>This gonorrhea will not go permanently,
    <br>unless the same woman is also delivered from the gonorrhea.
    <br>If the woman is healed of gonorrhea, and the man is healed of gonorrhea, the gonorrhea is gone.
    <br>But if one of them is healed of gonorrhea - we are just playing around.
    <br>Can you see the reason why our problem continues to persist?
    <br>Imagine, you say you have limitation, problem in your business, you rise to a big position...
    <br>You were prayed for and you rise to a big position - suddenly you...
    <br>Backwards!
    <br>It means we have not touched the root of your problem.
    <br>It says, "Poverty! Poverty!"
    <br>We pray for you and you are blessed, and you get there! 
    <br>Suddenly, the whole thing disappears again.
    <br>It means something is in you that will just strike anytime you want to strike.
    <br>It will just fold hands. It will allow you to continue to enjoy.
    <br>At the time you need that enjoyment most, it will destroy it.
    <br>That everything is smooth - it is too early for you to say, "I'm okay, now".
    <br>It's too early. Are you sure that old man is delivered?
    <br>Are you with me? If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand!
    <br>Can you see the root of your problem?
    <br>I want you to listen to our brother. You will learn a lot of lessons today.
    <br>We want our brother to tell us. Please open up.
    <br>With your word, a lot of people will be delivered.
    <br>So please, don't be selfish.
    <br>Being selfish is not opening up. Now you are delivered.
    <br>And you want this deliverance to affect many people positively.
    <br>A lot of people - million people, trillion people are watching this programme.
    <br>So for them to be delivered too - it's a big promotion for you.
    <br>I want you to open up. Don't be selfish.
    <br>Open up, tell us everything that has happened. Thank you.
    <br>Your name, your profession, your spiritual life.
    <br>Are you a Christian? Who are you? Listen.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Viewers all over the world, please watch and learn.
    <br>The experiences and what you are about to hear is greater than miracle.
    <br>Tell your neighour, "It is greater than miracle".
    <br>Why is it greater than miracle?
    <br>Because it will help you to maintain miracle.
    <br>And what helps you to maintain something you have is greater than that something you have.
    <br>Do you know,
    <br>maintenaince is salvation and salvation is maintenaince.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Maintenance is salvation, salvation is maintenaince".
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ignatius Dijeh.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian; I stay in Botswana.
    <br>I was here last Monday service and what I experienced was quite strange to me.
    <br>As you saw in the clip, when Wise Man Daniel was praying,
    <br>I found out that just in a second I could not understand myself
    <br>and the next second I came to my senses.
    <br>But after the deliverance, when they told me what I had said,
    <br>they even wrote it down for me and I watched the clip again;
    <br>I was more confused as to what had really happened.
    <br>Between then and now, I have been trying to figure out how all these things started,
    <br>how it relates to my life because I consider myself a Christian, an active Christian for that matter.
    <br>I pray and counsel others as a service to my church.
    <br>I hold responsibilities and I advise people.
    <br>I'm an elder in the church.
    <br>When this happened, I tried to reflect on my Christian life,
    <br>as to what I had been doing before and how this spirit had been in me.
    <br>Then when I looked at my life, I found out I had problems
    <br>I had a problem of inconsistency in relationship.
    <br>Even my business relationships were a failure.
    <br>The greatest point where my spiritual entanglement manifested is in my marital life.
    <br>In Botswana, I run a pharmacy business but I'm not a pharmacist by profession.
    <br>I hire pharmacists, but just like any other staff I employ, they hardly stay with me.
    <br>You employ people today - tomorrow they leave the employment.
    <br>In the midst of trying to save my business, I was not yet married then;
    <br>and I decided if I got married to a pharmacist,
    <br>it would do me good and help me to run our business as a family.
    <br>With that thought, I said to my people that I needed a wife,
    <br>on the condition that she was a pharmacist,
    <br>so that we could manage our business together.
    <br>That was done in 2006.
    <br>It is a tradition in our place, if you are far away abroad
    <br>and you need to get married, your people will arrange your marriage.
    <br>They will get you a wife.
    <br>After communicating and sharing pictures, if you feel it's okay, you come home and get married.
    <br>That happened to me in 2006.
    <br>Precisely, on 17th December 2006, I came down from Botswana
    <br>and by the 23rd of December, I was in the church and was wedded to my wife.
    <br>I went back to my business.
    <br>We never courted or met before our marriage.
    <br>Two years later, after her school, she joined me and
    <br>that was when my problem of inconsistency in relationships and affairs started.
    <br>On the very day I picked up my wife from the airport,
    <br>in fact, it started from when I picked up my wife from the airport.
    <br>We were coming home and there wasn't any chat of excitement.
    <br>I didn't feel happy picking up my wife.
    <br>It was just like I was a driver sent to pick someone up.
    <br>I was just focused on driving and in my head I was asking myself, "What are you doing?"
    <br>By the time we got home, I never felt any affection for my wife.
    <br>In fact, I just started seeing her as a roommate to me.
    <br>That really caused a very big strain, even to the extent that I was asking for a miracle
    <br>to realise that I was with my wife and not another man in the house.
    <br>The lady really went through hell.
    <br>Nevertheless, I was in a world of my own.
    <br>All my concern was to wake up in the morning, go to my business
    <br>and come back in the night.
    <br>Even at night when I knew I was coming back,
    <br>when I remembered that I was coming back home to this woman -
    <br>I would prefer to spend more time outside, before going home.
    <br>Eventually, we managed to make do and she became pregnant
    <br>but by the time she was four months pregnant, I could't manage it.
    <br>Fortunately, she had family in the USA, so I arranged for her
    <br>to stay with one of her sisters on the basis that she would have her baby in the USA.
    <br>As if to say that was my wish.
    <br>Actually, it was not my wish but a way of seeing her out of my life.
    <br>All the time she was away in the USA for her pregnancy,
    <br>I was hopeful and wishing that she would change her mind of coming back to me.
    <br>I felt that she was a problem to me and not really a wife.
    <br>Fortunately or unfortunately, she had the baby and I wasn't excited.
    <br>After six months, by persuasion, I agreed that she would come back.
    <br>When she came back with the baby, after six months, I just just as before.
    <br>I first of all took enough time to attend to my business,
    <br>and they were waiting for me at the airport.
    <br>When I picked them up at the airport,
    <br>I wished I had arranged for a hotel to put them in,
    <br>instead of taking them to my house.
    <br>Eventually, they came home on a Wednesday,
    <br>and by Friday, I put them back on a flight to Nigeria.
    <br>By the time they left, my goodness, all I was just doing
    <br>was using every means so that she would call it a day.
    <br>If I was busy at work or even if I was happy and my phone rang,
    <br>once I picked up the phone and it was my wife, I would become annoyed.
    <br>This continued, and I felt that "No, I don't want this marriage",
    <br>I would rather sacrifice everything for me to walk out of this marriage.
    <br>This was happening in 2009.
    <br>Between 2009 and now...
    <br>Between 2009 and now, I was just going out; I was no longer looking for a wife.
    <br>All I wanted was to have children here and there
    <br>because in the society now, people make do with single parenthood.
    <br>I could always take care of the children, without putting a wife into my house.
    <br>As I'm standing here, I'm telling you that I have four kids.
    <br>My wife is not aware of this.
    <br>These four kids - only one is from my marriage.
    <br>The other three kids are from three different women outside my marriage.
    <br>I would just be there and these things just kept happening.
    <br>In my head, I didn't even have the thought to talk to anybody.
    <br>There was something I kept discussing in my head, telling me this was okay.
    <br>I found myself with the principles I learnt from childhood being turned overnight,
    <br>just believing what my eyes saw and no longer what I had in my head.
    <br>As if to say, my head didn't belong to me.
    <br>At this point in time, it is actually true, it was the frustration in my business
    <br>that really brought down all the memories of everything.
    <br>Since these few days of my deliverance, I feel very much ashamed of all I have done
    <br>and all I have been praying for is that the man of God can help me
    <br>and first and foremost reconcile me with my family.
    <br>Of everything I have in life, I will let go, for my wife and daughter.
    <br>I am pleading with the man of God to please help me to recover my family.
    <br>It is just now that we are meeting again at The SCOAN.
    <br>It's aright. Did you listen to that?
    <br>I cannot continue listen to this, it is very touching. He's crying.
    <br>He said, it was like his head was no longer his own head.
    <br>He had different women outside, different children - one child for each woman.
    <br>It was like this head was no longer his head, he just continued to do the other thing.
    <br>After that deliverance on Sunday, and we now called him, all what he said,
    <br>he started telling us what happened.
    <br>Immediately we asked for the wife's number and I called the woman.
    <br>For so long he had separated from the dear woman
    <br>and after hearing our voice, the woman came down.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to see the woman, please.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Well.
    <br>I'm just seeing her for the first time, face to face because I was very busy for the past...
    <br>It's alright, don't worry. She wants to clean your eyes.
    <br>Please, let her clean your eyes.
    <br>Have it, little one. You can use it to clean your mum's eyes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Okay, it's alright.
    <br>Since past Sunday, I've been very busy.
    <br>Just hearing 'TB Joshua', 'The Synagogue', the woman said, whatever the case,
    <br>she cannot disobey the man of God, she has to come and explain herself.
    <br>That is why she is here today.
    <br>You know, the ministry, we are not going to deceive her, we will tell her the mind of God.
    <br>She is a Christian. She realised that in every situation, God has something to say,
    <br>"Let me hear what God said to this man."
    <br>That is why she is here. She is not here to meet the man here.
    <br>But she is here, "I want to hear what God is talking, is speaking to this man,
    <br>what message God has given to this man for me".
    <br>That is why she is here.
    <br>She is not here to meet our father here, but she is here to hear what God says,
    <br>what message this man has for me.
    <br>That is why she is here, and this is the beautiful lady.
    <br>Look at the little girl, looking like the father as well.
    <br>Okay, so now you have seen what has happened.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>You have seen the woman is really crying, you have seen what happened.
    <br>It was never his will; this is the work of satan.
    <br>Satan just wanted to destroy the house
    <br>but today, we thank God we are able to live to see today.
    <br>Look at what happened today and your husband was here
    <br>to ask God to bless his business but suddenly the Lord went straight to the root of the problem.
    <br>Suddenly.
    <br>Just like today, by the time we lay hands on you -
    <br>it is not yet time now to do that as we are here for reconciliation.
    <br>By the time they lay hands on you and whatever inside of you will also begin to speak.
    <br>This is why everyone of us is here today.
    <br>I really want to salute you
    <br>because you knew a time like this was coming,
    <br>that is why you have been waiting for a time like this.
    <br>If not, you would have messed up your life.
    <br>But today you refused to mess up your life, you waited for a time like this.
    <br>She refused to mess up her life.
    <br>Assume she had messed up her life now - no more reconciliation.
    <br>A time like this - we could not call her to come here.
    <br>In fact, she would say, "Man of God, I need to ask permission from so and so person",
    <br>in which case I would not even allow her to come here.
    <br>But today, because she knew that a time like this would come, she knew satan is a liar,
    <br>she has been waiting for a time like this - now the time has come.
    <br>I really want to salute you and say, "God, what a wonderful woman is this!"
    <br>Look at my little one.
    <br>The little one does not even know the father. Who is that?
    <br>Okay. Wait, I'm coming. Let me show.
    <br>For you to know, satan is a liar.
    <br>Look at him!
    <br>Who is this?
    <br>Who is he?
    <br>It's daddy. Baby, say, it's daddy!
    <br>It's daddy.
    <br>I'm very sorry, help me plead with my wife to forgive me. I'm very sorry!
    <br>I'm very sorry, please.
    <br>Look, you know we thank God for what God has done.
    <br>Even if you walk on your knees to your wife, it's not too bad.
    <br>Can you walk on your knees and let's go there.
    <br>Give me my little one.
    <br>Because it's not even enough to pay the price.
    <br>The price is too heavy.
    <br>We know, it's not you that has been doing this; it's satan.
    <br>You have to walk on your knees.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm so sorry.
    <br>I'm so sorry. I was confused. It wasn't me.
    <br>It won't happen again.
    <br>Please, come home.
    <br>Don't talk of the future now, talk of now.
    <br>Because if you now talk of the future, you are confusing the whole thing.
    <br>Talk of what happened now. "It won't happen again. I am so sorry!"
    <br>Please, I'm so sorry, forgive me, please.
    <br>Did you listen to that? We are not fighting flesh and blood.
    <br>It means our husband is not our enemy,
    <br>our wife is not our enemy, our children are not our enemies but spirit being.
    <br>It is not this flesh, the appearance you are seeing,
    <br>that is fighting you, that is destroying the marriage.
    <br>It's not this appearance you are looking at that we are fighting but that spirit being, the devil.
    <br>So please.
    <br>I want to join your family.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Reconciled In Jesus' Name
    <br>Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>She said, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Say it louder again!
    <br>Louder again.
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Reconciled In Jesus' Name
    <br>Chris, can you help me take them to the restaurant; let them be there and have a chat.
    <br>I'm coming to meet you.
    <br>Reconciled In Jesus' Name
    <br>Madam, come. I think once and for all
    <br>because when you are coming next week is thanksgiving
    <br>but it's better I should speak my mind now,
    <br>what God deposited in my heart.
    <br>Look, you are mother, you are everything.
    <br>I'm going to join you in this battle. I'm going to join this family.
    <br>Our duty now is:
    <br>This is the child of the house but those children at home -
    <br>we need to ask where they are so that we can take care of them.
    <br>You are a mother.
    <br>This is the child of the house. We still have to ask about those children.
    <br>We want to see them so we can take care of these children.
    <br>Take care of them. You are a mother.
    <br>We are going to ask those children and bring them home, take care of these children.
    <br>Please, I'm coming. Thank you.
    <br>Reconciled In Jesus' Name
    <br>Can you see God?
    <br>What beyond repair...
    <br>Beyond repair! Because of that deliverance...
    <br>No deliverance - no forgiveness. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Uncle, if somebody is telling you that he forgives you, just like that -
    <br>without deliverance taking place, it is lips.
    <br>That forgiveness is not from the heart.
    <br>If somebody looks at you and says, "I forgive you, it's over. I'm a Christian" - he is lying.
    <br>After deliverance, that forgiveness can come.
    <br>No deliverance - no forgiveness.
    <br>That is Jesus for you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
