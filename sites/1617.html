    <br>This is Prophet T.B. Joshua's first crusade in 1992.
    <br>Listen to him, as he addresses the people in his local dialect.
    <br>Our Father in Heaven, the sins of Your children that are hindering them...
    <br>... from receiving Your blessing; cleanse them with Your blood.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Clap for Jesus.
    <br>We are in a small crusade now, but in the future, it is going to be big!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesies to the people saying,
    <br>"We are in a small crusade now, but in the future, it's going to be big".
    <br>One might question why a church of just a small number on the outskirts of Lagos, Nigeria
    <br>should be called The Synagogue Church of All Nations
    <br>but this is the vision God had given to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You are the Lord
    <br>Let Your name be glorified
