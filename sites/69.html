    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities
    <br>which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen, right now.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Whatever situation you are in,
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Right now, give thanks to Him for His love.
    <br>Ask Him to come in His love and bless you,
    <br>and save you
    <br>and deliver you.
    <br>Come in Your love, oh Lord, and bless me.
    <br>Come in Your love, oh Lord, and heal me.
    <br>Come in Your love, oh Lord, and free me.
    <br>I command the love of God in your life, in your soul, in your spirit,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to enjoy the love of God in your health,
    <br>love of God in your finances,
    <br>love of God in your ministry,
    <br>love of God in your nation.
    <br>love of God in your career.
    <br>love of God in your destiny.
    <br>Come in Your love and restore.
    <br>Come in Your love and deliver.
    <br>Come in Your love and save us.
    <br>Come in your love and bless us.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God
    <br>as you send your testimony.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
