    <br>If your marriage is having challenges, don't give up! Ask God.
    <br>Don't let challenges quit you; let God.
    <br>Your business - don't let challenges quit you.
    <br>Your marriage - challenges should not quit you.
    <br>Your relationships - challenges should not quit you.
    <br>If you allow challenges to quit you. you are destroyed.
    <br>You are running from strength. You are running from grace, more grace.
    <br>Don't let challenges quit you but God. God should say leave, not challenges.
    <br>You abandon your marriage because of challenges.
    <br>You abandon your business partner because of challenges.
    <br>Don't let challenges quit you, but God.
    <br>Challenges are a grace to strengthen, help and equip you more.
    <br>When you are in the midst of challenges, ask God whether to quit or not -
    <br>not for that challenge to quit you.
    <br>No matter what they say about your wife or husband. Don't let it quit your marriage.
    <br>You quit your village because of witches and wizards.
    <br>Many of you that are here now - you abandoned your village because of witches and wizards.
    <br>You left your husband. You divorced because of challenges.
    <br>Everywhere are challenges.
    <br>You should see challenges as a blessing, not enemy.
    <br>See challenges as a blessing, not an enemy.
    <br>See me - my challenges turned to blessings.
    <br>Say with me, "My challenges turned to blessings".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Viewers, take this: Don't quit your marriage because of challenges.
    <br>Challenges could be this, could be that. Whatever they say about your wife or your husband -
    <br>your husband is this, your husband is a womanizer, your wife is a womanizer -
    <br>all challenges, situation.
    <br>Whatever they say, don't quit your marriage. Ask God.
    <br>In every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>If you ask God, "God, with this situation now, what will I do?" - God will tell you what to do.
    <br>Sometimes, these challenges are blessings to strengthen marriage or relationships.
    <br>When you see a wonderful relationship or great marriage today,
    <br>ask them and they will tell you how many times great challenges came.
    <br>They refused to quit but today, they are role-models.
    <br>"Ah, I love that husband and wife. I love them. Look at their home - wonderful!"
    <br>Ask them what they have gone through. They will tell you a story that you could not bear.
    <br>A story that divorced your marriage. A story that separated you from your relationship.
    <br>But yet, they stand together.
    <br>50% of  us here are a good example of what I'm talking about.
    <br>You know before now, some years in the past, your impression about T.B. Joshua was so bad.
    <br>Many of you were asked to pray against me, in your different meetings.
    <br>But I refused to pray against you because I knew you will be coming here one day.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you were asking God to bind me, to loose me, to bind me, to loose me -
    <br>there is nothing you have not said in your fasting and prayer, but I kept quiet
    <br>because I knew you would be coming. You are welcome.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's assume while you were binding me, loosing me, I too was standing here to loose you, to bind you.
    <br>If you could not bind me, I would have bound you.
    <br>If you could not loose me, I would have loosed you.
    <br>If you could not deliver me, I would have delivered you. Something would have happened.
    <br>You take a stone, you throw it at me
    <br>If I show you many stones - your own stones, I stored them.
    <br>Instead of taking it and throwing it back, I said, "No, I will not throw this stone back".
    <br>I kept the stone because I knew you would be coming back here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know, it's a stone you are throwing when you say,
    <br>"Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, this man is a devil, is this..."
    <br>You are throwing stones and each stone bounces in front of me.
    <br>I look at it. God says, "No, don't throw it back!"
    <br>Assume I throw the stone back - if you cannot deliver me, I will deliver you.
    <br>But today, you are here. This is a good example of what I'm talking about.
    <br>You destroy relationships beyond repair.
    <br>When people offend you, your attitude, your behavior -
    <br>you curse the person to the extent that that relationship will not be repaired again.
    <br>That is exactly what many of you are going through now.
    <br>When you know that this person that is bad now can be the best tomorrow, you will take precaution.
    <br>Do you know that someone who is satan today to you, can be your saviour tomorrow?
    <br>I don't destroy relationships beyond repair.
    <br>If I have you as a friend, no matter what you have done to me,
    <br>I will make sure I will not destroy that relationship beyond repair.
    <br>because I know tomorrow, you may be my saviour.
    <br>Brother, come. See my brother here.
    <br>No matter if I am a friend to my brother here - we are very close friends -
    <br>no matter what happens between us, no matter what the attempt,
    <br>if I learn that he is trying to murder me, to kill me, to destroy me and God protects me,
    <br>I will make sure that that relationship will not be destroyed through me beyond repair
    <br>because I know tomorrow, this man may be there for me.
    <br>But if I now, because of what this man wants to do to me and God protects me,
    <br>I now begin to fight back beyond repair,
    <br>I will not be able to have this opportunity in the future, tomorrow.
    <br>But today, you destroy relationships beyond repair because of situations, challenges, conflicts.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You have been destroying your relationships with people beyond repair,
    <br>because of conflicts, trouble and challenges.
    <br>You have been destroying your relationships with people beyond repair".
    <br>You can fight but be conscious that the person you are fighting may be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>Don't destroy that relationship beyond what? - Repair.
    <br>This is the situation many of you find yourself in today. All of you. All.
    <br>There are many people you know - very very great and they were very close to you.
    <br>They were your enemy in the past.
    <br>Because of fight, you used your hand to destroy that relationship beyond repair.
    <br>Today, you can't just have that goal to meet them.
    <br>Even marriage, your former husband - you divorced and separated -
    <br>that relationship should not be destroyed beyond repair.
    <br>That is your former marriage and you divorced, you left the marriage.
    <br>That man can be someone who is your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>You woman too can be a saviour to that man tomorrow.
    <br>I am a good example. People have destroyed their relationship with me beyond repair.
    <br>Today, imagine I stand here and say, "Hey,  praise the Lord. That man is devil, he is evil spirit.
    <br>He drinks blood. he did that...".
    <br>If you now see me with the man tomorrow, how will you feel?
    <br>The church is scattered. You will leave my church.
    <br>"T.B - you said yesterday that the man is a devil. You said the man drinks blood.
    <br>You are now flirting with the man. It means you people are drinking blood together."
    <br>That is the problem. This is why I'm just alone here.
    <br>Imagine I stand here to say, "Hey, that church is devil, that church drinks blood, that man is not good.
    <br>That man is this, that man is that". - I have said it, and all of you know. And it is televised on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So, if you now see me with the man I said is drinking blood, is a devil,
    <br>you know he is a devil, you can bet it, and you now see me tomorrow with the man,
    <br>will you still be a member of my church?
    <br>Ah! You have to leave because we are drinking blood together.
    <br>That is, destroy relationships beyond repair.
    <br>That is the life I live.
    <br>When I know the argument is too hot, I keep quiet
    <br>because I don't want to destroy the relationship beyond repair.
    <br>That is why people, the whole world says, "T. B. Joshua will not reply".
    <br>That is the slogan people say - "Ah, that man will not talk."
    <br>If you say, "T.B. Joshua is this, is that", no matter what you say about T.B. Joshua, he will not talk.
    <br>The reason is that I don't want to destroy any relationship beyond repair
    <br>because the man I'm fighting may be my saviour tomorrow.
    <br>So, it's better I should choose the side of silence.
    <br>If I remain silent, you don't know what is in my mind. I will just remain silent.
    <br>This is why the noise everywhere, they say, "He is not replying, he is not this" - I will not talk
    <br>because the man that is fighting me, the man that wants me to die may be my saviour tomorrow.
    <br>Tomorrow is mystery.
    <br>So, I don't want to destroy that relationship.
    <br>If tomorrow he is my saviour, I can still walk majestically towards him.
    <br>I will tell him, "I never said anything when you were abusing me. I never said anything.
    <br>Quote me, what did I say?" He will say, "You never said anything".
    <br>"Ok, let the relationship continue."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I think this will help you in many things you have in court - going to court, sueing this, that.
    <br>Many things you say, 'over your dead body', your former wife, your former husband,
    <br>whatever he might have done to you yesterday, whatever -
    <br>I think you can still look to see what you can quickly do.
    <br>If you say you are too big, what of your children?
    <br>If I say, "I'm too big to be helped", what of my children?
    <br>The person who wants me to die can be my children's saviour tomorrow.
    <br>Madam, you are crying. Come. What happened?
    <br>Man of God, I am going through that situation.
    <br>I have been so hurt so much by...
    <br>Don't worry. Sit down. The message really touched her.
    <br>She cannot bear it again and started crying, saying, "Ah! Oh! This message is talking to me!"
    <br>Please, don't destroy relationships beyond repair. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour, please.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>Stand up and say it to yourself.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>Tell viewers all over the world.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[Don't destroy relationships beyond repair.]
    <br>That's all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When there is a hot argument, look at the person who is after you.
    <br>He may be the saviour tomorrow.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you. Hallelujah.
