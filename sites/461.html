    <br>HOW To Get FAITH | TB Joshua
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Last meeting was about secret of faith
    <br>and today we continue - secret of faith.
    <br>Let someone say, "Secret of faith".
    <br>All what we are seeing happens as a result of faith in God, not faith in man, not faith in faith.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of Hebrews chapter 4.
    <br>"Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest,
    <br>let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it.
    <br>For indeed the Gospel was preached to us as well as to them..."
    <br>Who are "them", who are "us"?
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>"... but the word which they heard did not profit them,..."
    <br>There is no gain.
    <br>Why the word did not profit them?
    <br>Because it was not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.
    <br>That is why it did not profit them.
    <br>"For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said."
    <br>Faith and rest cannot be separated from one another
    <br>for who have believed, enter into the rest.
    <br>Take your time - read the Book of Hebrews 4 and Romans 10:17,
    <br>also, look at the Book of Hebrews 11:1 - take your time and read it as well.
    <br>Hebrews 4:3.
    <br>THE  SECRET OF FAITH
    <br>Look at what the Bible says.
    <br>Faith and rest cannot be separated from one another.
    <br>And where is that rest?
    <br>Faith is a heart that believes in God through ordinary circumstances.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Not "some things" - no, all things - take note of that.
    <br>Faith grows and develops in the heart of man, you can say, "In the spirit".
    <br>Anything that comes by force is not faith.
    <br>You force me to be a Christian, you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>Giving me money, everything, deceiving me, whatever you want to do...
    <br>Or you do charity, you give me money, you send me to school, you do everything;
    <br>you want me to be a Christian - that is not faith.
    <br>Anything that comes by force is not faith.
    <br>"You are not a Christian, you are not part of our family, you are not part of that, I will not love you,
    <br>you are not part of me, I can't give you a business.
    <br>No, I cannot employ you in my company because you are not a Christian."
    <br>That is not faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Anything that comes by force is not faith."
    <br>Faith is something that comes spontaneously, willingly.
    <br>If you force me to be a Christian by giving me whatever you want to give me
    <br>or you adopt me as your child, you give me everything and I become a Christian,
    <br>such Christianity cannot last.
    <br>If you stop giving me those things, I will stop being a Christian.
    <br>If you become a Christian because of the miracle you receive,
    <br>if there is no miracle tomorrow, you will stop being a Christian.
    <br>Faith is something that comes spontaneously.
    <br>Whenever we truly believe our Lord Jesus, we have rest.
    <br>Whenever we truly believe, our hearts will be at rest.
    <br>That is "truly believe".
    <br>If our hearts are uneasy and restless, if we are afraid of this and that,
    <br>if we are fearful and feeling lost,
    <br>struggling with all our efforts to plan, to resolve this and that, struggling with all,
    <br>then, this shows we have not yet believed.
    <br>When one believes, he is at rest.
    <br>Therefore, when a person believes, he will no longer worry;
    <br>he will leave it for God.
    <br>There must be works to our faith.
    <br>Our works prove our faith.
    <br>Your works complete your faith.
    <br>If you don't have good works, you have no faith.
    <br>Your works complete your faith, perfect your faith.
    <br>There must be works to our faith.
    <br>You say you have faith in God.
    <br>What kind of faith is that without good works?
    <br>When you are there, I know you are there.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>When I see you are there, I know you are there.
    <br>Do we have to force ourselves to believe you are there?
    <br>Do we have to reason and research
    <br>before we can acknowledge the reality of this fact?
    <br>Do we have to contrive, to think that you are there?
    <br>Within a second, we believe spontaneously.
    <br>There is no need for us to struggle to believe
    <br>because faith is something that comes spontaneously.
    <br>Anything that comes by force is not faith.
    <br>If a person has not received the teaching of the Scripture
    <br>or the promise of the Holy Ghost in his heart,
    <br>forcing him to do such acts is indeed a risk
    <br>because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If a person has not received the teaching of the Scripture
    <br>or the promise of the Holy Ghost in his heart,
    <br>forcing him to do such acts is indeed a risk
    <br>because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word."
    <br>You must take God's Word to heart; you must live in God's Word.
    <br>If you have taken God's Word to heart, you can act it.
    <br>It will by its very nature, change you
    <br>and when it does, you will automatically find yourself acting.
    <br>This kind of rest is very real, genuine and natural.
    <br>It is not a pretentious calm.
    <br>Whereas, it is dangerous, like a snake...
    <br>You see a snake calm; if you don't touch the snake, it will not answer, but if you touch it, you will see.
    <br>It is not unnatural.
    <br>Faith brings in restfulness.
    <br>When faith comes, it brings in restfulness
    <br>because of the knowledge that God is for us.
    <br>If God is for us, who can be against us?
    <br>That is the knowledge.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Faith brings in restfulness because of the knowledge that God is for us."
    <br>If God is for us, who can be against us?
    <br>Therefore, there is the rest.
    <br>If God is for you and for me, who can be against us?
    <br>Nobody.
    <br>Therefore, there is the rest.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There is the rest".
    <br>Faith does not rest in itself; take note of that - you ask where faith rests.
    <br>Faith does not rest in itself;
    <br>God is the place where faith rests.
    <br>Only those who have such rest have faith.
    <br>Those who do not have such rest do not have faith.
    <br>Have faith in God; all things are possible.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>All things are possible.
    <br>Why do you always get disappointments?
    <br>Each time you say, "In the name of Jesus, be blessed. In the name of Jesus, be healed" -
    <br>if a person has not received the teaching of the Scripture
    <br>or the promise of the Holy Ghost in his heart,
    <br>forcing himself to say, "Be healed, be blessed, be saved;
    <br>you are blessed; you are healed",
    <br>such acts are indeed a risk.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Today, you see people...
    <br>If a person, whether you are a pastor or Christian, or bishop, or priest, or pope, or whatever;
    <br>if a person has not received the teaching of the Scripture,
    <br>or the promise of the Holy Spirit in his heart...
    <br>That Word must go deep into your blood.
    <br>Forcing himself to say, "be healed, be delivered, be saved, in the name of Jesus. Hallelujah!" -
    <br>such acts are indeed a risk because God does nothing without His Word.
    <br>You cannot talk to God without His Word.
    <br>You cannot heal, bless without His Word.
    <br>You cannot pray for people without His Word.
    <br>He does nothing without His Word.
    <br>If you don't have His Word and you act on His behalf, it is indeed a risk.
    <br>When I say, "indeed a risk" - I mean, you may be saying it many years, many times,
    <br>one day satan will ask you, "By what authority? Who gave you the Word?"
    <br>Remember the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>What has happened to many of us here today
    <br>is a result of the Word we don't have and we are speaking it -  empty professions of faith.
    <br>If we examine our daily lives, we will find out how much faith we have.
    <br>Empty professions or confessions of faith will not help us at all.
    <br>If you examine your life, you will find out how much faith you have.
    <br>You need faith to laugh, to sit, to eat;
    <br>if you don't do all this by faith, but by yourself,
    <br>one day satan will ask you, "By what authority are you doing all this?"
    <br>The Bible is full of promises for every matter.
    <br>Are you sick? - Let the sick say, "I'm healed" - it is there.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Bible is full of promises for every matter."
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>Are you poor?
    <br>What are you facing?
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>As long as you have faith, God will work for you.
    <br>If we examine our lives, we will find out how much faith we have.
    <br>If we examine our daily lives, we will find out how much faith we have.
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things.
    <br>Look; you need faith to look.
    <br>I want to turn, I need faith to turn.
    <br>If I turn on my own, that could lead to anything.
    <br>If you have been turning, looking, eating, walking on your own without faith,
    <br>one day satan will attack you.
    <br>This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives."
    <br>I need faith to talk, to dress, to make up, to comb my hair, to walk, to put on my shoes.
    <br>There is no way God will help you without faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>There is no way God could come to your matter without faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Do you know how much you need God?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>It is a big question.
    <br>Do you know the meaning of that?
    <br>The world today; they believe they can do certain things on their own.
    <br>They believe they can put on their dress without God.
    <br>The world believes they can look without God.
    <br>The world believes, "I can turn on my own, I don't need God to turn.
    <br>I don't need prayer to turn."
    <br>And you don't know that people turn and that ends their career.
    <br>Mere turning like this - spinal cord injury.
    <br>When you know how much you need God, you will know you need God to look, to move,
    <br>to smile, to greet, to wear dress, to say, "Ha ha, ho ho".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives".
    <br>The Bible is full of promises for every matter.
    <br>For every matter there are promises.
    <br>Take note of this.
    <br>If a person has not received the teaching of the Scripture,
    <br>or the promise of the Holy Ghost in his heart,
    <br>forcing him to do this, that, in the name of God -
    <br>such act is indeed a risk
    <br>because God does nothing without His Word.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Using the Word you have read, fill your prayer with Scriptures."
    <br>Live in God's Word.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of John 6:63.
    <br>"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.
    <br>The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life."
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>This means Bible faith comes from God's Word.
    <br>There are many faiths today: faith in faith, faith in ourselves, faith in our belief...
    <br>There is one faith Christians believe -
    <br>faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Bible faith comes from God's Word.
    <br>If Bible faith comes from God's Word, no one can please God without faith.
    <br>How will you begin to act on His behalf, calling His name, preaching, teaching, praying without faith?
    <br>And faith is something that comes spontaneously.
    <br>There is no need for us to struggle to believe.
    <br>If a person believes, he is at rest, he will no longer worry.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>Thank you.
