    <br>A NEW BEGINNING
    <br>Prayer For 2017 With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever medium you are using to view us right now,
    <br>with a handshake, "Good Morning!"
    <br>I say, "Good Morning," once again.
    <br>The year 2016 is coming to an end
    <br>and we are about to enter 2017, which is a new year.
    <br>Let every unfavourable situation you have been in,
    <br>end with this year, 2016!
    <br>Be it your business, be it your health,
    <br>be it your career, be it your family, your marriage, just name it,
    <br>let it end with this year, 2016!
    <br>This is what we call, "New Year!"
    <br>Viewers, I am not speaking to you on my own.
    <br>I am led by the Holy Spirit to pray for you, to usher you into the New Year,
    <br>to stop satan from killing, destroying and stealing from your life.
    <br>This is why we are here.
    <br>What a God we serve!
    <br>Viewers, at the command of Jesus, Peter walked on the sea.
    <br>At the command of Jesus, Blind Bartimaeus regained his sight.
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever in the life of His anointed ones.
    <br>With Him, all things are possible.
    <br>At His command right now, I command every unfavourable situation in your life
    <br>to cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In your business, your finances, your health, every unfavourable situation,
    <br>to cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I decree, in the name of Jesus, let it end with this year, 2016 -
    <br>all unfavourable situations, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, this is the message for you.
    <br>I want you to know that whatever situation you are in this year 2016,
    <br>it will end with it, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>I will be right back to usher you into the New Year!
    <br>Remain in faith; thank you.
    <br>YOU ARE WATCHING A NEW BEGINNING
    <br>WITH PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>A New Beginning Prayer For 2017
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>YOU ARE WATCHING A NEW BEGINNING
    <br>WITH PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Viewers all over the world , I am here with instructions from Jesus to you.
    <br>Let us open to Matthew 5:8.
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."
    <br>This means, if we regard iniquity, sin, wrong in our hearts, the Lord will not hear our prayer.
    <br>If you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You have already grieved God.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, this means our heart is the temple; our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Give me your heart!
    <br>Let us remove the barrier between our hearts and the Spirit of God.
    <br>Let us remove it!
    <br>What could be the barrier?
    <br>Grudges, strife, outrage, bitterness, pain of the past, an unforgiving spirit, hatred.
    <br>Let us remove the barrier between our hearts and the Spirit of God.
    <br>I remove that barrier, in the name of Jesus  Christ!
    <br>That barrier, be removed, in the name of Jesus  Christ!
    <br>I command in the name of Jesus,
    <br>all knees shall bow, all tongues shall confess, "Jesus is the Lord!"
    <br>Every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God, be removed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That barrier, be removed, in the name of Jesus  Christ!
    <br>You barrier, be removed, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Liberty in prayer can only be obtained where there is a right atmosphere.
    <br>That atmosphere can be one of unity and harmony.
    <br>I command that barrier to be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The year 2017 - I don't know the time you are in your nation, your continent -
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Listen to me - the year 2017 will come with challenges.
    <br>No matter the challenges, my brother, listen to me.
    <br>Challenges will make you stronger.
    <br>They will not impair you but improve you.
    <br>There will be many challenges.
    <br>We don't have enough time.
    <br>I have the prophetic messages for the year 2017 here.
    <br>So many challenges, but my brother, listen.
    <br>Those challenges will not impair you but improve you.
    <br>I mean, your struggles will make you stronger.
    <br>Just trust and believe.
    <br>Hear God say to you, "The voice of wailing shall be silenced".
    <br>Listen, "The voice of difficulty shall be silenced;
    <br>the voice of setback and hardship shall be silenced".
    <br>There will be so many challenges but you - just believe!
    <br>I am sent to give you a dream.
    <br>Don't forget, Jesus is the Father of dreams.
    <br>He gave a dream to Abraham, a dream to Daniel, a dream to Peter.
    <br>A new dream of breakthrough for you!
    <br>A new dream of prosperity for you, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>A new dream of good health for you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>A new dream of breakthrough!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to go on my knees.
    <br>Start your New Year on your knees, for you and your household.
    <br>Begin your New Year on your knees.
    <br>A new dream has come - Happy New Year!
    <br>There will be so many challenges - economic challenges, financial challenges
    <br>but your challenges will not impair you but improve you.
    <br>Your struggles will make you stronger.
    <br>The message for the New Year is here but we shall meet.
    <br>Father, I want to leave your children and usher them into a new beginning.
    <br>A new dream has come - Happy New Year!
    <br>A dream of breakthrough for you!
    <br>A dream of walking with the Lord. A new dream for you!
    <br>A new dream of prosperity for you!
    <br>A new dream of good health for you!
    <br>Spiritual uplift for you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is the message for you.
    <br>A new dream has come - no matter the challenges, no matter what comes!
    <br>A new dream of breakthrough for you!
    <br>A new dream of prosperity for you, good health for you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Emmanuel!
