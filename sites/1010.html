    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Lucy Onoriode Aghri.
    <br>I am here to share my testimony of the wondrous deliverance that God has done for me
    <br>via the New Morning Water.
    <br>Two weeks ago I was very lucky and opportuned to be in the service
    <br>when the man of God shared the New Morning Water - the power and the glory of God.
    <br>Prior to that time in March 2017, just a few days after I relocated from Abuja,
    <br>I started having excruciating pains in my womb.
    <br>I could not explain the pains - the pains were such that when they started I would not be able to walk.
    <br>So, I had so much fear.
    <br>And at the same time, I was eating in my dream
    <br>and drinking all sorts of unknown liquid substances in my dream night after night, about three times a week.
    <br>These pains would come and I would drink water. I would not know what to do.
    <br>I went to a HealthPlus Pharmacy and they gave me some medication.
    <br>I took three courses of antibiotics, but the pains continued without ceasing.
    <br>At that point I heard different stories.
    <br>Some said that the water in Lagos was not good,
    <br>but that was not the case.
    <br>I went to the Gold Cross Hospital in Ikoyi when the pains became too much to bear.
    <br>They carried out tests and a scan and they could not find anything wrong with me.
    <br>At that point I knew the devil was after my life and I had to do something about it.
    <br>As I said earlier, I was in The SCOAN two weeks ago
    <br>and the evangelists sprayed the New Morning Water on me.
    <br>Three days later I got back from work in the evening about 6 pm,
    <br>and the pains started and this time it was worse.
    <br>I was wondering what was going on in my life. I did not know what to do.
    <br>I drank two bottles of water and the pains were excruciating.
    <br>I fetched the New Morning Water and I sprayed it on my womb and the pain was even worse than before.
    <br>It was like labour pain. At that point I was losing my breath.
    <br>So, I quickly called a friend of mine and said, "Something is about to come out through my body".
    <br>"I have a lot of pressure. Something is about to come out of my body".
    <br>And she said, "Are you pregnant?". I said, "I know that I am not pregnant".
    <br>She said, "Yes, we know. But what is coming out? Where is it coming out from?"
    <br>And I was panicking. I said, "I don't know".
    <br>It felt as if there was a 5 kilogram stone in my stomach.
    <br>At that point I could not move.
    <br>I just managed to get myself to my bathroom
    <br>and when I got there, I could not talk on the phone.
    <br>All of a sudden, I passed out a long substance into the bathroom
    <br>and immediately when it came out of my body the pain just stopped.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus?
    <br>SUPERNATURAL Woman 'Gives Birth' To Worm!!!
    <br>As you can see here, this is the long substance that came out of my body.
    <br>I don't know what it is; I cannot explain it.
    <br>But I can tell you that immediately when it came out of my body - it was just like a woman that has just given birth -
    <br>the pains stopped and up to this moment I have had no more pains.
    <br>Before now I would feel as though something was eating deeply into my womb.
    <br>I would hear voices that would say, "This could be cancer", and I would rebuke it.
    <br>At that point, when I started hearing voices too, I knew that the devil was after my life.
    <br>I just give God the glory because I don't know what would have happened if this stayed in my body.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty. Only Jesus could have justly done this.
    <br>You heard the testimony of the sister who said
    <br>there was no hospital she did not visit in order to find out what was the cause of this problem.
    <br>But nothing could be detected. She said she had a terrible evil attack whereby she would eat daily in the dream
    <br>and she realised that this was spiritual and only Jesus could rescue her.
    <br>Imagine this object in her womb - we are just seeing it like this -
    <br>when it was still in her womb, you can imagine what would be there -
    <br>eating up her womb and leading her quietly to her grave, as she said.
    <br>But the moment she was ministered the New Morning Water, as the man of God introduced it two weeks ago,
    <br>she delivered this object.
    <br>And since then?
    <br>The pains have completely gone.
    <br>Can you press on your stomach and tell us how you are feeling?
    <br>I don't have any pain there anymore.
    <br>Could you do this before?
    <br>No, it even distracted me at work.
    <br>When I tried to carry on with my daily routine, I would feel the pain and it caused me a lot of embarrassment.
    <br>Press it once again and tell us.
    <br>No, I don't feel any pain.
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah! We give glory to God for this.
