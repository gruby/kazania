  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>I am Doctor Sunday Simon.
    <br>I am an orthopaedic technologist specialising in fabricating prosthetics and orthoses
    <br>that is known as artificial legs and artificial hands.
    <br>I formerly worked with Leprosy Mission International, based in Niger State (Nigeria).
    <br>I am originally from Benue State (Nigeria).
    <br>The people standing behind me are my family.
    <br>This is my wife, my first daughter, my son, my daughter, my daughter and the other one.
    <br>They are seven; the two kids are my grandchildren.
    <br>My first training was in Tanzania; that was vocational training with a vocational job.
    <br>I went to school in Ethiopia also.
    <br>The one I did in Tanzania was a diploma course.
    <br>The NGO employed me as an orthopaedic technologist.
    <br>I was the one making artificial limbs for people who had undergone amputations,
    <br>hands, upper limbs and lower limbs ? that is hands and legs.
    <br>In 2013, the NGO said they could not continue any longer and we were retrenched.
    <br>After I was retrenched, I started going around looking for clients
    <br>so I could make artificial limbs for them to make money and take care of my family.
    <br>I travelled all the way to Abuja to the National Orthopaedic Hospital and did operations there.
    <br>I travelled to other local governments in Niger State (Nigeria) and other states.
    <br>There were three clients I collected money from -
    <br>one was below the knee amputation and two were ?ak?; with ?ak?, I charged N300,000.
    <br>Below the knee is N250,000.
    <br>I used to collect advances to enable me to buy the chemicals
    <br>and other materials needed to make the artificial limb for them.
    <br>I collected and on my way to Jos to buy there and in Kano,
    <br>because I used to get my materials in Jos and Kano,
    <br>on my way, after the rain, we were going down.
    <br>I was involved in an accident in my own car.
    <br>The only thing I knew is that I found myself in hospital.
    <br>I was told by the nurse behind me that I was in the General Hospital in Jos.
    <br>When I asked what happened, she said I had been in an accident and my leg had been amputated.
    <br>I started crying and she said I should not cry, that they had saved my life.
    <br>I, who used to fabricate for other people had now become a victim.
    <br>I don?t know what was really wrong with me.
    <br>The chief medical officer in charge of that hospital said I should not worry.
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>I spent 21 days in the hospital.
    <br>After they calculated everything, the surgery and the drugs,
    <br>it amounted to N250,000 because the medical officer in charge of that hospital knew me.
    <br>He said he was aware of my situation, that I should go without paying anything.
    <br>He said he would take care of everything with the hospital authorities.
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>Upon getting home on the third day,
    <br>the people I had collected the money from came back and said they needed the artificial leg,
    <br>either the artificial leg or the money.
    <br>I said, ?I?m just coming from the hospital.
    <br>How can I use these crutches and make an artificial leg for you? Give me time.?
    <br>They said there was no more time they could give me, that I should pay.
    <br>I said, ?OK, let me think over it?.
    <br>A week later, I was about to eat.
    <br>They put food for me on my table and I was about to eat.
    <br>I saw the man with a policeman.
    <br>They said they wanted to see me at the police station.
    <br>I asked, "Now?"
    <br>They said, "Yes".
    <br>I asked if they could wait so I could eat.
    <br>They said no, that it was a long journey and they couldn?t wait for me to eat
    <br>because at that time, armed robbers used to terrorize people on the road.
    <br>I said, ?OK,? and asked them to get one of my shirts.
    <br>I put on my shirt and started carrying my crutches.
    <br>I started following them.
    <br>When we got there, they said, ?You are a crook!?
    <br>?You collected money from somebody and you cannot pay them.?
    <br>The police started saying things to me.
    <br>I said, ?OK, because I didn?t fabricate the leg for the man, there is nothing I can say.
    <br>You will say whatever you want?.
    <br>Then they locked me inside.
    <br>My wife started crying at home and contacted my friends.
    <br>They gave me one month to either pay them the money or make the artificial limb for them.
    <br>I told them that it was not easy for me.
    <br>Secondly, the landlord gave me a quit notice, he gave me one month to pack out from the house.
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>So, my children had to stop school.
    <br>The one who is playing football is supposed to be outside the country by now;
    <br>the friends he was playing with have gone.
    <br>He cannot meet up with the financial demand.
    <br>One of my daughters there who is pregnant ? it was when the trouble was too much for my wife
    <br>and she brought her here that I realised she was pregnant.
    <br>When the pressure became too much for me, I decided I would not stay any longer,
    <br>receiving this embarrassment, that I would come to Lagos where people didn?t know me.
    <br>However, in northern states, I am well known.
    <br>When I came to Lagos, I walked inside the town
    <br>and saw all these Hausa people sitting down, begging.
    <br>I considered what I would be able to do with just one leg and crutches.
    <br>I didn?t know what to do.
    <br>I just sat down with them.
    <br>I understood the Hausa people very well.
    <br>I can speak Hausa.
    <br>I spent almost 15 years in Hausa land.
    <br>I would stay there with them.
    <br>Whenever they brought money or gifts, they would share them, one by one.
    <br>I would stay among them and collect money.
    <br>Sometimes, they would bring food.
    <br>The clothes I am wearing was a gift from them.
    <br>If you saw the way I dressed, you would think that I was a worker.
    <br>There were only two items of clothing ? jeans and trousers that I came with from Niger
    <br>but I have different types of shirts that were given to me.
    <br>You mean to say, sir, that you actually had to run away from where you were living in Niger State
    <br>to run down to Lagos, because everyone knew you as a medical doctor in Niger State,
    <br>and because of the embarrassment of what you were facing people were running after you,
    <br>trying to collect the money, that you had taken from them to produce artificial legs.
    <br>You actually escaped to Lagos and started to beg, is that right?
    <br>Yes; that is what I said.
    <br>Around Niger State, people know me but in Lagos State, I can say nobody knows me here.
    <br>I can do any type of job here.
    <br>That?s why I ran to Lagos.
    <br>I wanted to look for a way to help my family.
    <br>I could not sit down and watch the way my children would be crying for food.
    <br>People would drive us away and call police on us.
    <br>That is why I came down here.
    <br>When I get this little money, it just helps me to pay for accommodation
    <br>because since last year May that I came here, I?ve been staying in a lodging.
    <br>If I don?t pay, they will drive me out.
    <br>All the money I am collecting, I will pay for the lodging.
    <br>I will eat from it.
    <br>Sometimes, I will not eat anything.
    <br>Things continued like that.
    <br>Then, one day, a woman came and asked me the problem I had.
    <br>I shared my problem briefly with her and she asked me if I had heard about The SCOAN.
    <br>I told her yes and that Hausa people know of it, that they used to bring gifts for them.
    <br>I didn?t know that the woman was video recording me.
    <br>An hour later, she showed me the video of how I sat in the midst of those people.
    <br>I saw all these Hausa people running.
    <br>I asked what was happening.
    <br>Before I could look, all these government agencies called Kick Against Indiscipline came
    <br>and started beating me on my back.
    <br>Before I could put the stump of my leg into the prosthesis, they had started beating me.
    <br>I nearly fell onto the main road and escaped a motor crushing me.
    <br>After I was flogged by those people, I made up my mind that if God be on my side, I would come here.
    <br>OK.
    <br>So, we've heard it from our father here; this is the situation that brought him to The SCOAN.
    <br>We want to hear a quick word from his wife.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome.
    <br>Can you also introduce yourself to us and tell us what you can say concerning
    <br>what your husband has been saying right now?
    <br>People of God; Good Morning, everybody.
    <br>My name is Faith Simon.
    <br>This man by me is my husband.
    <br>It happened as my husband has said.
    <br>My husband left us.
    <br>The police started disturbing us.
    <br>Our house rent has expired.
    <br>The landlord is disturbing us.
    <br>People of God, help me!
    <br>Man of God, help me! I have suffered!
    <br>When I leave here, I don?t have anywhere to go.
    <br>I have suffered.
    <br>No food, nothing ? no help from anywhere.
    <br>I think we have heard from our mother; we can see the emotions because of what she has passed through.
    <br>We can understand that she was left alone with her children, when her husband was forced to leave.
    <br>My name is Janet Simon.
    <br>I am 11 years old.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was that of poverty.
    <br>We have suffered a lot.
    <br>Right now, I am not even going to school anymore.
    <br>My dad is no longer working.
    <br>He has been begging in Lagos for long.
    <br>My mum ? it was just a little business that we have been doing.
    <br>It is only garri (cassava product) that we drink.
    <br>Man of God, please, help us.
    <br>My family and I have suffered.
    <br>I am not even going to school anymore. My mates are going to school; I would be seeing them.
    <br>Man of God, please, help my family!
    <br>We have suffered a lot!
    <br>We have suffered.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help us!
    <br>OK. So, we have listened to the little girl; she is only 11 years old
    <br>but because of the situation she is out of school and she is actually forced to join her mother on the streets,
    <br>selling small items just to try to fend for herself.
    <br>At this point, we want to ask our father.
    <br>Here, we can see a few documents on the board beside him.
    <br>Can you just explain to us what we are seeing on these documents here,
    <br>to back up the experience you are sharing.
    <br>This is my certificate from Tanzania.
    <br>As an Orthopaedic Technologist, I have a diploma in orthopaedic technology.
    <br>This is my certificate as an Orthopaedic Technologist,
    <br>specialising in orthoses and prostheses ? both upper and lower limbs.
    <br>This is my work, this is my certificate that I finished my school in Tanzania.
    <br>This is me, the time I was in school.
    <br>This one is from Sudan.
    <br>This is me - Nigeria.
    <br>This one is from Sudan also.
    <br>All of them are my friends, my colleagues.
    <br>This is me, here.
    <br>This is my profession.
    <br>This is the type of prosthesis.
    <br>You can see it.
    <br>This is the type of prosthesis.
    <br>This is a sample I made for a lady coming from Akwa Ibom.
    <br>So, once again, people of God; we have heard it from this family.
    <br>As we mentioned earlier, as people of God, we can't afford to look the other way,
    <br>when we see our brothers in trouble.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that your rewards in life are determined
    <br>by the problems you solve for someone else.
    <br>We have listened to the experience of this family.
    <br>We are here today to give a message from our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He said that right now, for your immediate needs, to establish yourself -
    <br>we are here right now, on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide
    <br>to give this family the sum of N500,000.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation
    <br>In addition to this, Prophet T.B. Joshua said that the children who are out of school will be given scholarships
    <br>to return to their education.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation
    <br>In addition to that, the accommodation problem that they talked about will also be sorted out
    <br>and accommodation will be provided for this family,
    <br>so that all the family can be together as one
    <br>and the different children that are scattered to different places because of this problem
    <br>can come together as one.
    <br>This is a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua for this family, to let them know
    <br>that there is hope in Christ Jesus.
    <br>This is the sum of N500,000 for their immediate needs,
    <br>a scholarship for the children who had been taken out of school,
    <br>and in addition to that, accommodation will be provided for this family,
    <br>by the ministry and Emmanuel TV partners worldwide.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation
    <br>The children that have been mentioned - here we can see them overcome by emotions.
    <br>The children who were out of school will be taken in under the scholarship program,
    <br>here at The SCOAN, to the glory of God Almighty.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation
    <br>Man of God, I thank you very much.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel TV, The SCOAN team, everybody, all the members - I thank you.
    <br>God will double it for you people.
    <br>And this church will be the "highest" church in the whole world.
    <br>Yes, because this is where anybody can run to and be saved, both spiritually and financially.
    <br>I thank God for what the man of God has done for my family.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>God bless you - you and your family.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners Give 500,000 Naira, Scholarships & Accommodation
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us ? Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I thank you very much.
    <br>Words cannot express my joy.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>As our brother said earlier, the joy is so much that this family did not even have natural words to express it,
    <br>except to say, "Thank You, Jesus Christ."
    <br>We wouldn't want to go much farther.
    <br>We know that they are still overcome by the emotions and joy of what has just happened to them.
    <br>But we want to remind and stress to our viewers all over the world that we are showing you this,
    <br>and presenting this publicly as an encouragement to people all over the world.
    <br>There are many people who have similar challenges, similar conditions to this family,
    <br>who are in your neighbourhood, in your environment, your locality
    <br>and we believe that God has given to you something that is capable of changing their lives.
    <br>Let this be an inspiration to you.
    <br>How many people are you capable of changing, and how many people have you changed?
    <br>This is actually what matters to Jesus Christ, more than church attendance, giving offerings in the church,
    <br>more than just praising or worshipping God on Sundays and fasting and praying;
    <br>"How many people's lives have you changed?"
    <br>Let this inspire you to build your life around your contributions to others
    <br>and definitely your own success and happiness depend on your willingness to help others solve their problems.
    <br>We thank God for what God has done in the life of this family.
    <br>We know that the best is yet to come and they're going to come back with more wonderful testimonies,
    <br>as a result of this blessing that they received here.
    <br>This is just a seed, that will be planted to produce a multiple harvest in their lives,
    <br>and we know that the best is yet to come.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>After sharing his pathetic experience with the people of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners promised to help Doctor Sunday and his family.
    <br>The promise given to me by Prophet T.B. Joshua:
    <br>When I came here last week, he blessed me with some money ? N500,000 ? that I should use it
    <br>to  help settle some of my problems and he also promised me accommodation.
    <br>He said I should go round, find accommodation and he would pay for me
    <br>so that I could settle down with my family in peace.
    <br>I have gone round and found an accommodation.
    <br>That is why I came here this evening.
    <br>How much does your accommodation cost?
    <br>My accommodation for two years is N450,000.
    <br>We are here to present to you the total sum of N450,000 cash, so you can take care of your accommodation.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You have saved us!
    <br>All our problems are over.
    <br>Our past is over!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners give Doctor Sunday and his family
    <br>a sum of N450,000 for his accommodation and also for the upkeep of himself and his family.
    <br>Dr Sunday Simon & Family Sing Songs Of Praise And Thanksgiving To God
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners promised to give Doctor Sunday's children
    <br>scholarship to further their education.
    <br>Tell us your name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us ? Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Alexander Simon.
    <br>I am from Niger State, Nigeria.
    <br>We are the ones whom the man of God provided accommodation for.
    <br>He blessed my father with N500,000 to start his business.
    <br>Now, he has started the business ? to God be the glory!
    <br>He also promised us scholarships and that is why we are here today.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us ? Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Janet Simon.
    <br>I came here with my dad, Mr Sunday Simon, with my mother, and my siblings.
    <br>We came here, my dad was sacked from his work.
    <br>It was very difficult for us.
    <br>We came here hoping for help from the man of God and he helped us,
    <br>gave us accommodation and the sum of N500,000 to start our business.
    <br>Right now, we are here to thank God for the man of God who has made it possible for us
    <br>to continue our schooling, in Jesus? name.
    <br>I had stopped going to school.
    <br>What my friends were learning, I was not with them and they left me behind.
    <br>I missed some classes ? some subjects; I was not there.
    <br>I missed a lot.
    <br>My knowledge was going down because I was not in school.
    <br>Right now, I want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>for what they have done for my life and for the promise he has made for me and my family.
    <br>I pray God will bless him, in Jesus? name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I stopped school in SS3 and I was not able to complete my secondary school education.
    <br>My mates paid for the WAEC and NECO exams.
    <br>What even baffled me the most was that it was a government school
    <br>but I was not able to raise the amount for the WAEC; so, I stopped secondary school
    <br>but now, I want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>for the promise he made to us for a scholarship.
    <br>Not only did Prophet T.B. Joshua provide accommodation for the family,
    <br>he also promised to give Doctor Sunday's children scholarship to go back to school again,
    <br>in order to achieve their dreams and aspirations in life.
    <br>Here is the sum of N140,000 presented to Doctor Sunday and his children.
    <br>Glory be to God and I thank the man of God.
    <br>I want to thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>for the money that my children requested for their schooling has been given to them.
    <br>They requested for a total sum of N126,500
    <br>and the man of God increased the money to N140,000 which I am having now.
    <br>God will bless him, The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>and the staff of The SCOAN.
    <br>Now, I am happy and all my family, including my children, are happy.
    <br>They can go back to school now.
    <br>I pray that everything will be a success, that they will not disappoint the man of God,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank you very much.
    <br>We would like to hear from our brother and sister.
    <br>I want to thank the man of God for what he has done for us.
    <br>I am very exited that I am going back to school.
    <br>I want to thank the Emmanuel TV partners for what they have done
    <br>because they have done a lot for us.
    <br>I want to thank them.
    <br>May God bless them, in Jesus? name.
    <br>I promise the man of God that I will not fail him; I will face my studies
    <br>and make it throughout secondary school.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So, let's hear from our sister.
    <br>I want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>for what they have done in my life and that of my family.
    <br>I want to appreciate him.
    <br>I pray that God will multiply him, in Jesus name.
    <br>I promise to do well in my education and come out with flying colours, in Jesus? name.
    <br>I pray that he prays for me and strengthens me in His way, in Jesus? name.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We also thank God for your life, for this wonderful grace you have received.
    <br>We want to encourage you to stay true to our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Remember, the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners are doing this for your future,
    <br>so that you may come out as a good and successful citizen,
    <br>to be useful to yourself, your family and your society.
    <br>This is because the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners see their contribution to your life
    <br>as an assignment from God.
    <br>Just like you have promised, make sure you face your studies and be serious in school.
    <br>We believe that your coming out will indeed be in flying colours, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
