  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to believe that is the response of viewers over there.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's quickly take a look at the Book of Ephesians 3;
    <br>take your reading from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Our proof text shall be taken from verse 14.
    <br>“For this reason I kneel before the Father,
    <br>from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.”
    <br>That is the name, Jesus.
    <br>“I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power
    <br>through his Spirit in your inner being,”
    <br>This is what we are going to talk about today - inner being - how important it is.
    <br>You can only do things as Christ would have done them, in your inner being.
    <br>So, in verse 17:
    <br>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.”
    <br>He dwells in our hearts through faith.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>He dwells in our hearts through faith – that is, inner being.
    <br>Christ dwells in our hearts through faith.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We talk about the Bible, a Book that reads us even when we read it.
    <br>You understand me?
    <br>As I am reading the Bible, it is reading me.
    <br>That is the difference between the Bible and other books.
    <br>A book that reads us even when we read it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>A book that reads us even when we read it.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>A book that reads us even when we read it.
    <br>You may not know the difference between the Bible and other books.
    <br>The difference is, it is a Book that reads us even when we read it.
    <br>As you read the Bible, it is reading you.
    <br>There is no other book like that.
    <br>As you are reading it, it is reading you.
    <br>It is an uncommon sort of Book; it requires an uncommon sort of reading.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>That is where we are; that is where our trouble lies.
    <br>It is not too far from there.
    <br>Who can tell me, Church - how do you read the Bible?
    <br>Come on.
    <br>How do you read your Bible?
    <br>- Good Morning, Church.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>I go on my knees first and I pray to God, "Thank You, God, for giving me this day.
    <br>Thank You for waking me up this morning full of Your joy, Your happiness, Your mercy and grace."
    <br>Then, I go and take my Bible and always start with Psalm 51, from verse 7 till 19.
    <br>While praying; tell us about prayer.
    <br>Waking up in the morning is by the grace of God.
    <br>When I wake up, I have to thank Him for waking me up.
    <br>What are you expecting when you are praying?
    <br>I'm expecting God to give me more grace for that day.
    <br>OK, it's alright.
    <br>You are still talking about your knowledge of prayer.
    <br>Thank you, sister - you may be seated.
    <br>Prayer is a two-way conversation; as you talk to Him, then, listen to His voice.
    <br>You can't just be like, "Jesus Christ, give me bread, give me biscuit".
    <br>You must also listen to Him; you cannot just talk alone.
    <br>It is a two-way conversation.
    <br>OK, how can you just be talking to me?
    <br>Stand up, madam.
    <br>Can you talk to me?
    <br>Continue talking to me.
    <br>Good Morning, Prophet.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I hope you are doing very well.
    <br>I hope you are praying for us all the time.
    <br>We thank you; we appreciate all that you have been doing for us.
    <br>How do you feel, when you are talking alone, and I'm not responding?
    <br>It's like you are not listening, or you are not hearing me.
    <br>Thank you, madam.
    <br>Can somebody else?
    <br>OK, give it to a man; come on.
    <br>Listen.
    <br>Keep talking to me about whatever you want.
    <br>Hello Prophet. I'm very happy to meet you today.
    <br>It has always been a pleasure for me to meet you.
    <br>How do you feel, when you keep talking alone?
    <br>You say, "Hello Prophet", and I'm not answering you.
    <br>It is quite frustrating, to talk to somebody who is not responding.
    <br>Why do you continue talking then?
    <br>If he knows it is frustrating, why is he talking?
    <br>"Hello Prophet", and the Prophet is not answering.
    <br>If I were you, I would not talk again, until the Prophet answers.
    <br>You say, "Hello Prophet"; even on your phone...
    <br>OK, on your phone - you pick up the phone and say, "Hello, Prophet", and you don't hear a response -
    <br>can you continue to talk?
    <br>You would start talking to yourself, "Maybe Prophet does not hear me. This line is not good."
    <br>And I would be hearing you...
    <br>"This line is not good. What's wrong with the line? Hello Prophet." -
    <br>you keep talking to yourself, and I keep listening.
    <br>"This line is not good. Will I stay in the position? Hello, Prophet. Oh my God. This line is bad."
    <br>You would not want to move forward.
    <br>Can you see the life you people are living with God?
    <br>That is the life all of you live.
    <br>It means you don't know the God you are serving.
    <br>You don't even know the God you are talking to.
    <br>Right from your forefathers; the way you have been introduced to God, you serve the god of your forefathers.
    <br>Just in a traditional way, the way you have been introduced to God, is the way you are going on.
    <br>Prayer is a two-way conversation.
    <br>Talk to me.
    <br>- Hello, Prophet.
    <br>- Oh, how are you?
    <br>- I'm doing great.
    <br>- Thank you. I'm happy to hear from you.
    <br>Yes, I'm happy to hear from you too. It has been a pleasure meeting you today.
    <br>Oh, what a wonderful message.
    <br>This is just the prayer - two-way conversation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is very frustrating to learn now that you are not even a Christian,
    <br>because you don't talk to God; the God you are talking to - you are just faking yourself.
    <br>Very frustrating.
    <br>You should agree with me that you are not a Christian, you are a religious man.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You are a religious man".
    <br>A religious man is someone who believes in one-way talk.
    <br>They don’t believe in two-way talk
    <br>because it takes the Holy Spirit to have that two-way conversation.
    <br>You say, "Hello!", He says, "Hi. How are you?", "Hello. Where are you?" "I'm there", - it takes the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Now, have you put that point down?
    <br>You are putting that point - put it down.
    <br>You need to work on that - what is wrong with you?
    <br>What has happened to you?
    <br>You say you are a Christian; look at what this man of God is saying here.
    <br>So very embarrassing to you as a Christian.
    <br>Write it down, "What do you need to do? What has happened?"
    <br>Think of what you have not done right in the past,
    <br>what do you need to put right.
    <br>Two-way conversation – you talk to Him and then you listen to Him.
    <br>You talk to Him and then you listen to what He has to say.
    <br>It is a dialogue; that is prayer.
    <br>It is what?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Dialogue - that is prayer.
    <br>No one can stand up to say, "Yes, my prayer has been a dialogue. My prayer has been a two-way conversation";
    <br>no one can stand up to say it.
    <br>You just talk, "Jesus, give me bread, biscuit..."
    <br>When you are tired, you say, "Amen".
    <br>That is it - when you are tired, or somebody knocks the door, you go and open the door.
    <br>"In Jesus' name, amen!" - that is full stop.
    <br>Can we look at where our problem comes from?
    <br>Yes, let's dig; why you cannot have a two-way conversation?
    <br>When you hold grudges against your brother or anyone and you are reading the Bible,
    <br>you are just reading literature.
    <br>When you hold  grudges against anyone, you have no excuse, whether you are right or wrong.
    <br>When you hold grudges against anyone and you are reading the Bible,
    <br>you are just reading history, literature, not the Bible.
    <br>You have no excuse.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, as a Christian, you have no excuse to hold grudges -
    <br>whether the person wronged you, or you have wronged the person, you have been cheated.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>When you hold grudges against anyone and you are reading the Bible,
    <br>you are just reading literature.
    <br>And I will define literature for you.
    <br>You are just reading literature; I mean, you are just reading chemistry, biology, history, biography.
    <br>Literature is the letter and Scripture, the Bible, is the Letter inspired by the Spirit of God.
    <br>That is the difference.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>Literature is the letter; the Bible, Scripture is the Letter as well but inspired by the Spirit of God.
    <br>The difference between literature and the Scripture -
    <br>one is inspired by the Spirit of God and one is just the letter.
    <br>And the one that is inspired by the Spirit of God -
    <br>the thoughts of the Bible, the Scripture, are from the Spirit of God and the language is from men.
    <br>Men were carried along as they spoke by the Spirit of God.
    <br>So, if you want to read...
    <br>You must have a free spirit to read the Bible
    <br>because it is a Book that is inspired by the Spirit of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Spirit of God does not share a place.
    <br>He wants to be the Landlord; He doesn’t want to be a tenant.
    <br>He doesn’t want to share with anyone.
    <br>He wants to own the whole place; He is very jealous.
    <br>Like in the house we have tenants - no.
    <br>He wants to be the owner, He doesn't want to share, He wants to be there alone.
    <br>He can't share the apartment with anyone.
    <br>That is why your spirit must be free to read the Bible.
    <br>If your spirit is not free, you should not be surprised to see that what you are reading is not real,
    <br>is a literature, history.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by a free spirit?
    <br>It is a spirit that forgives, forgets the past – the past pain.
    <br>For you to be able to take the Word of God to heart and truly make it part of you,
    <br>you must have a free spirit to read.
    <br>If not, you will only memorise the Word, commit it to memory.
    <br>It will never become an integral part, live in you, dominate you.
    <br>It can never dominate you when your spirit is not free.
    <br>When your spirit is not free, you can read, but you only commit the Word to what?
    <br>To memory.
    <br>We have committed the Word to memory and we thought we were Christians.
    <br>To commit the Bible to memory is to read it, to preach it and to teach it.
    <br>You cannot commit the Word to memory and live in the Word.
    <br>We cannot build one up spiritually on philosophies – on account of that.
    <br>We cannot build one up spiritually on the theory of the Word, on the history of the Word.
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>We can only be spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>If that was the case, every educated person would be spiritual.
    <br>When you are able to take the Word to heart, it will by its very nature, change you.
    <br>You keep asking, "I read the Bible, I have the knowledge of the Bible, I can preach", but you are not changed - no.
    <br>You have not taken the Word to the heart, you only committed the Word to memory.
    <br>You commit the Word to memory, you have the knowledge, you know the Word,
    <br>you can preach it, you can teach it.
    <br>That is why we have many powerful preachers and teachers of the Word.
    <br>When they preach the Word, they say, "Heaven is close" - that doesn't mean they are part of the Word,
    <br>or that they have taken the Word to heart.
    <br>When you take the Word to heart, it will by its very nature, change you.
    <br>It has a purifying power.
    <br>When you take the Word to heart and truly make it part of you, it has a purifying power.
    <br>It has converting power.
    <br>It has healing power.
    <br>It is food for our soul; it is a guide for our feet.
    <br>It keeps one from sin and error.
    <br>It rejoices our heart.
    <br>When you have taken the Word to heart and truly made it part of you, it has a purifying power.
    <br>It has healing power.
    <br>Don't just open and begin to say, "Psalm 23 says..." - you started quoting as if...
    <br>That is not...
    <br>You started repeating the Word of the Bible; you say, "Yes, the Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want" -
    <br>it can't work.
    <br>It is not the word in the letter that works; it is the Word in our heart,
    <br>the Word on the lips of believers.
    <br>We make it work.
    <br>Sometimes, when you enter homes, you see there the Bible at the entrance of the house.
    <br>They hang the Bible at the entrance of the house.
    <br>When you want to enter, you say, "What is this?"
    <br>A big Bible at the entrance of the house.
    <br>Some, when they want to do the foundation, they put the Bible under the foundationm to do what?
    <br>Is it the Bible that will do the job?
    <br>We make it work!
    <br>That is why anyone can go to a bookshop and buy a Bible.
    <br>They will not ask you, "Are you a Christian?" before giving you a copy of the Bible.
    <br>Anybody can obtain the Bible.
    <br>It is the literature, the history about God’s generals that you bought.
    <br>It is inspiring when you are inspired.
    <br>Literature is the letter and the Scripture, the Bible, is the Letter inspired by the Spirit of God.
    <br>The thoughts are from the Spirit of God.
    <br>The thoughts in the Bible are from the Spirit of God while the language is from men.
    <br>So, now, for you to begin to repeat the Word here,
    <br>"The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want".
    <br>You are expecting something to happen.
    <br>You are repeating literature, letters that are not inspired.
    <br>You must be carried along by the Spirit to do that.
    <br>If you are not carried along by the Spirit to do that, you are only vomiting letter, a literature, history.
    <br>And history cannot do it.
    <br>History is all about events.
    <br>It is very painful, when you pick some text book, and they begin to teach you how to pray.
    <br>You begin to say... That will work?
    <br>I want to leave you, but let me take you back where I'm coming from.
    <br>Where are we coming from?
    <br>It is very important.
    <br>Prayer is a two-way conversation; you talk to Him and then you listen.
    <br>You can't be like, "Lord Jesus, heal me!"
    <br>Himself must say, "Be healed!"
    <br>Himself must say something.
    <br>But you say, "Heal me, Lord!" Himself - something must come from Him.
    <br>"No. Hold on. It is not yet time. There are lessons for you to learn. You need to learn enough lessons.
    <br>This is to strengthen your desire for Me. This is to preserve you for Me. Don't worry."
    <br>You must hear a Word.
    <br>But you don't hear any Word, you just come to conclusion and say, "Amen!"
    <br>This is 419.
    <br>You are bribing God, you are duping God, you try to play God.
    <br>It is not right.
    <br>If you agree with me, let me see your hand.
    <br>It is very difficult.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>We have a lot to do.
    <br>So, now, where we are coming from, we talk of two-way conversation.
    <br>How do we break this?
    <br>I have told you.
    <br>If it is a two-way conversation, it means you must hear from God.
    <br>To hear from God is for you not to hold grudges when reading the Bible.
    <br>When you don't hold grudges and you forgive and forget,
    <br>"Forgive me as I forgive those who have..." what?
    <br>If you can stand by that principle and you pick up your Bible, the Bible will speak to you.
    <br>It is a Book that reads us even when we are reading it.
    <br>Now, it is like you are reading it, but it is not reading you.
    <br>When you forgive those who sin against you, when you are reading it, it is reading you.
    <br>That is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When it is reading you, it is God who is reading you.
    <br>But now, you read the Bible while holding grudges.
    <br>Reading the Bible while holding grudges means you are not reading the Bible
    <br>but reading literature, history, James Hadley Chase.
    <br>Can somebody answer me now, "What do you need to do now?"
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>- Praise the Lord!
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>We must always have a forgiving heart, no matter the offence, no matter what pain we feel.
    <br>Because you have no excuse?
    <br>We have no excuse.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong.
    <br>God doesn't want us to hold an offence, and our heart should be free.
    <br>Then, we can communicate with God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>If you have a forgiving spirit, your heart is free; when your heart is free, you can read the Bible.
    <br>That is when you can talk in His presence; that is when you can be in His presence and worship.
    <br>Many of us here; you are holding so much pain of the past, grudges and others, and you are sitting down.
    <br>So, that is it.
    <br>Thank you; clap for my mum.
    <br>I want to hear from our father.
    <br>Good Morning.
    <br>The first thing, before you even pick your Bible; the Bible would be laying down like this,
    <br>the first thing I must do is to say, "God, I release everyone that I'm holding an offence against".
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>He says that first, before picking the Bible, I release everyone.
    <br>The moment you release those who hold an offence against you,
    <br>the Lord will release you, God will come into this.
    <br>Once you say, you are released, your heart is free;
    <br>if there is anyone over there that holds offence against you, they are wasting their time.
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>He will fight for you, He will stand for you, He will support you, He will be on your side.
    <br>Thank you, brother.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can you tell us - have you been doing that in the past?
    <br>I've done it once, and I will tell you what...
    <br>Have you been doing that in the past?
    <br>No.
    <br>You ate once?
    <br>No, it must be every day.
    <br>You ate every day.
    <br>Can you see; you have to have a free spirit.
    <br>The answer you give us now seems to nullify what you have said.
    <br>We begin to doubt what you have said.
    <br>Do you really mean what you are saying?
    <br>I mean it.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where are we coming from now?
    <br>We are told that we must not hold grudges while reading the Bible.
    <br>We need a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a hearing spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that is thirsty and hungry for God’s Word.
    <br>Can you see the reason why you have not been very...
    <br>I mean the zeal, the urge for God's Word is not there, unless you want to send back to sender - Psalm 35.
    <br>It is when somebody has offended you, "It is very painful", or you have a nightmare;
    <br>last night they came, they beat you, you can see the stripes at your back,
    <br>even to the extent they cut your hair; you start looking for a portion in the Bible to retaliate.
    <br>You look for Psalm 35, Psalm 91.
    <br>You look for that, you pray and pray, you open the Bible under your pillow, in case they come.
    <br>Bible is not like that.
    <br>Please, sir, I would like to ask a question.
    <br>If you have a relationship that they don't want you; like family friends - just friend, generally,
    <br>neighbour, people you feel...
    <br>They don't want to see you?
    <br>They don't need your relationship, and you try to stay away.
    <br>Sometimes they keep malice, even when you greet them.
    <br>Let me help you.
    <br>You say you have someone; a friend or someone who does not want to see you
    <br>and just hates you for no reason.
    <br>You need to forgive them if you have anything against them; on their own side, God will fight the battle.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God uses the weapon of forgiveness to fight for us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>God uses the weapon of forgiveness to fight for us.
    <br>Once you forgive everyone and you have a free spirit, you leave the battle for God.
    <br>You will see God begin to fight for you.
    <br>God will meet your enemy and say, "Will you forgive this woman?"
    <br>If he doesn't forgive, He has a way of handling the matter.
    <br>"Forgive Esther"; if Esther forgave everyone and now she has a free spirit,
    <br>the seraphim of God - let me put it that way,
    <br>the seraphim of God will begin to move.
    <br>"You have to forgive Esther" - if you say no, He has a way of handling you.
    <br>Seraphim will continue to go all over to act for Esther, to fight for Esther,
    <br>to meet those who don't want Esther around,
    <br>those who don't want to hear the voice of Esther.
    <br>The seraphim will go all over and do the job.
    <br>You just forgive and see.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You just forgive.
    <br>Can you hear; it is a very powerful weapon.
    <br>Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.
    <br>It means that if you forgive everyone, He will take it up on Himself;
    <br>the seraphim will go around and begin to act for you,
    <br>meeting them one by one,
    <br>"You say you don't want to hear Esther. You say you hate Esther."
    <br>The seraphim will go and begin to act for you, while you are just somewhere;
    <br>because you have forgiven everyone.
    <br>Your own is to forgive and leave the battle for God.
    <br>Leave it for God don’t worry yourself
    <br>Leave it for God don’t cry no more
    <br>Jesus is alive praise God
    <br>You can face tomorrow
    <br>He understands what you are
    <br>Passing through today
    <br>Let us glorify His name
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>To hold grudges against your brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>To hold grudges against your brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The question I want to ask goes thus:
    <br>our papa says we should learn to forgive and not to hold grudges.
    <br>What of a case that you have forgiven and said it was over,
    <br>and you struggle to let go.
    <br>The same case is still stuck to you and the same issue continues that you struggle to let it go.
    <br>You have forgiven and you still see it repeating.
    <br>You say, "Please, can't you let this go?"
    <br>He says, "I want to let it go. You are not going anywhere. I am here."
    <br>How do you go about it, daddy?
    <br>Look,
    <br>our own forgiveness is not because we want our neighbour to forgive us
    <br>but because of eternal life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Our forgiveness is not because we want our neighbour to forgive us
    <br>but because of our eternal life.
    <br>Eternal 
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>Eternal 
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>We do not live right because of our neighbour; we live right because of eternal life.
    <br>"I want to be good, so that my neighbour will know I'm a good man" - no!
    <br>I don't live good because of you, for you to know I'm living good, I'm a good man;
    <br>I'm living good because of eternal life.
    <br>Because you have forgiven now...
    <br>You forgive Mr. Thye, and Thye hates you.
    <br>You say, "I forgive you", and Thye refuses to forgive you...
    <br>God is our witness; our neighbour cannot be our witness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Once you forgive and that forgiveness comes from your heart, God takes up your case.
    <br>If someone is somewhere that refuses to forgive you, and he wants to see your end,
    <br>leave it for God, leave the battle for God.
    <br>You know, your enemy does not want you to walk freely.
    <br>If your neighbour hates you with passion, it is a weapon to draw you closer to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If your neighbour hates you with passion, it is a weapon to draw you closer to God.
    <br>That somebody hates me with passion, I need God more, so that I will not be caught unprepared.
    <br>It is a weapon of drawing you closer to God.
    <br>What is our strategy and our tactic?
    <br>If someone is after you to kill you, you change your tactic and strategy.
    <br>What is your strategy, what is your weapon, what is your armour?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are happy, I think - as a minister of God.
    <br>You have forgiven someone, and you said you forgave.
    <br>That is when he wants you to die, to be killed.
    <br>The reward of our forgiveness is not from our neighbour but eternal life.
    <br>That is the reward.
    <br>Thank you, brother.
