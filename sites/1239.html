    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, you may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Wow! Thank You, Jesus, for the wonderful grace to be here.
    <br>Just before delving into today's message,
    <br>I want to make one thing very clear;
    <br>whatever you will hear from me today and whatever you will see in my life today
    <br>is as a direct result of the amazing grace of God in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At a time where selfishness reigns supreme and materialism runs rife,
    <br>it's so rare and precious to see someone who so selflessly, sacrificially gives his time,
    <br>love, resources, energy, his whole life to the advancement of God's Kingdom
    <br>and to the development of others.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is not a man seeking fame or fortune, wealth or material positions - no!
    <br>He is a man after God's own heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You and I know that this ministry, we could have branches in every country all over the world.
    <br>People are demanding it.
    <br>We could build a cathedral that could seat the largest, highest number of people.
    <br>But Prophet T.B. Joshua knows that these are not the things that are tests to our genuineness.
    <br>These are not the strengths of the ministry.
    <br>The strength of the ministry is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You heard the instructions from God.
    <br>Even now, Prophet T.B. Joshua is removing the overflow congregation
    <br>because obedience is better than sacrifice.
    <br>He is not interested in building structures; he is interested in building people.
    <br>He is not concerned about populating this church but populating the Kingdom of God - Heaven.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today I want to ask you a question.
    <br>This is a question that I believe may have run through your mind before
    <br>and it's a very important issue that we need to talk to ourselves as children of God,
    <br>to examine ourselves in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Why is it that so often, we repeat our wrong,
    <br>we return to our mistakes even after we have seen the repercussions?
    <br>I mean, just examine your life.
    <br>You know the price you pay anytime you misbehave.
    <br>You know the damage that is done -
    <br>damage that is done to you heart, relationships, business, career, destiny, just name it
    <br>Anytime you misbehave, you know what happens.
    <br>Yet, time and time again, we seem to so easily fall into the trap of satan.
    <br>We easily fall for satan's tricks;
    <br>we are so easily enticed, ensnared and entrapped.
    <br>Like Prophet T.B. Joshua said:
    <br>We just see the outward effects of the devil but we seem to be blind to the spiritual cause.
    <br>We are concerned with the fruits; we look at the fruits instead of striking the root.
    <br>This is what I want to talk about today and I just want to share a very quick story.
    <br>This is a true story, a real life experience that happened.
    <br>It was here in the church. I remember it very vividly.
    <br>We were doing a time of counselling on Monday for those that received healing and deliverance.
    <br>A young man came to where the evangelists were and he was crying his eyes out.
    <br>He was distraught, distressed.
    <br>His tears could evoke sympathy from even the stoniest of hearts.
    <br>If you saw the way this guy was crying, wailing, moaning, grumbling…
    <br>In the midst of this, we were trying to find out what was happening, what was going on.
    <br>Long story short, we were able to decipher through the pain, the tears and the cries
    <br>that this young man was a happily married man, two children, great job, picture-perfect life
    <br>when suddenly something happened.
    <br>One day, he received a friend request on Facebook from a lady he did not know and he just accepted.
    <br>One thing led to another - discussions started, exchange of words, conversations, pictures.
    <br>Later, he went to go and meet that very same lady.
    <br>And before he knew it, sin had entered.
    <br>Unknown to him, that lady attended the same college as his wife.
    <br>Through a mutual friend, the secret was leaked, and the wife took away the children and left home.
    <br>This man was distraught, crying.
    <br>He made one statement, "Satan sent this Jezebel, Delilah to come and destroy my marriage“.
    <br>But we tried to probe and go deep to the root of the issue.
    <br>We asked the brother a question, "Brother, who accepted the friend request?"
    <br>He said, "It was me".
    <br>"Who initiated the conversation with this lady?"
    <br>"Me."
    <br>"Who asked for her picture?"
    <br>"Me."
    <br>"Who suggested that you meet up and arranged a meeting with her?"
    <br>"Me."
    <br>"Who put a password on your phone so that your wife will not suspect what is going on?"
    <br>"Me."
    <br>"No Delilah destroyed your marriage. You tempted the devil to tempt you."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By the grace of God, in this particular instance, God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to call the wife.
    <br>She came and after many tears, there was forgiveness and the couple was reconciled together.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>But the story does not end here.
    <br>Six months later thereabout, I was holding one of the Emmanuel TV prayerlines and the phone rang.
    <br>The voice of the person at the other end sounded familiar.
    <br>The brother said, "Please, help me, pray for me. My wife has left".
    <br>I began to know, "Wait a minute. This is the same guy!"
    <br>I asked him a question and his name and I knew it was the same guy.
    <br>The moment he realised that I knew what had happened, he grew silent.
    <br>And I asked him, "Brother, what happened again? The issue was resolved".
    <br>He was silent.
    <br>Until finally, he said, "I met another lady on Facebook".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People of God, I don't want you to judge that young man
    <br>and I am not here to judge him because no one is perfect.
    <br>I want you to examine your own life.
    <br>Those healed of the punishment of sin are likely to return to sin when the pains are over.
    <br>We all fight these battles.
    <br>The battle we fight in our daily walk is with our flesh, our senses.
    <br>By nature, man is rebellious.
    <br>Man's spirit - if we choose, we would likely choose fleshly desires,
    <br>and satan is looking for any opportunity to strike, to hit,
    <br>to get in and corrupt, and get into our heart.
    <br>He is looking for that chance.
    <br>Anytime you succumb to temptations, fleshly desires, fleshly tendencies,
    <br>satan has a foothold in your heart.
    <br>He gets in, starts his work of stealing, killing destruction, injecting his poison.
    <br>He gets busy at work, eroding your morals, dulling your conscience,
    <br>decaying your values, blurring the lines between the acceptable and abominable.
    <br>Before you know it, satan with a foothold in your heart,
    <br>something you vowed that you would never do, suddenly you think,
    <br>"Maybe, I should just try it once. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad".
    <br>Something that you have eaten before and it was bitter, disgusting, destructive.
    <br>You say, "Maybe if I try it this time, there will be a different result. Let me still try it".
    <br>Something that as a child, you were told, "Don’t go there! Don’t do this; this will destroy you!",
    <br>you say, "Well, maybe they didn’t know. Maybe there is a reason why they told me not to go there.
    <br>Let me just try it out and see for myself. Experience is the best teacher".
    <br>Black and white fade to grey.
    <br>People of God know this.
    <br>When the Word of God is in your heart, it will preserve and protect you from desiring sin.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>When the Word of God is in your heart, it will preserve and protect you from desiring sin.
    <br>This brings us to the title of today's message: DEALING WITH DESIRE.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bible to the proof text which is taken from the Book of James 1:13 - 15.
    <br>We need to deal with desire because prevention is better than cure.
    <br>James 1:13-15:
    <br>"When tempted, no one should say, God is tempting me.
    <br>For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone;
    <br>but each person is tempted when they are dragged away
    <br>by their own evil desire and enticed.
    <br>Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin
    <br>and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death."
    <br>Everyone has fleshly desires but do you provide a platform for them in your heart?
    <br>Do you lay a foundation for them to flourish,
    <br>a base for them to bloom in your heart?
    <br>One thing I want to let you know, brethren; it is important we understand this.
    <br>The day you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Saviour,
    <br>the day you make a commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against satan.
    <br>This means war.
    <br>By identifying yourself with Christ, you have made satan your bitter enemy.
    <br>Becoming a Christian is basically making yourself a mark, a target for satan to shoot at.
    <br>He hates you the way he hates Jesus.
    <br>That is the meaning of our Christian journey.
    <br>That is why our journey as Christians, our road to the throne is not a bed of roses.
    <br>It's not just easy; it's not rosy.
    <br>We have loss and gain. We experience ups and downs, highs and lows.
    <br>We experience social, moral and economic uncertainties.
    <br>We harbour internal and external troubles.
    <br>The road to the Kingdom of God is not just a bed of roses because satan is looking for a way to strike.
    <br>Looking for an avenue to hit, to penetrate.
    <br>And God knows this.
    <br>Look at the case of Job.
    <br>With God's permission, you can be tempted.
    <br>Temptation can come in any form, at anytime, from anyone; temptation can come.
    <br>With God's permission, you can be tempted.
    <br>If God is aware of it, if God has knowledge of it, if God allows it,
    <br>you can be tempted just like Job.
    <br>Don't think it strange and doubt your Guard.
    <br>No, you can be attacked but you can never be destroyed.
    <br>I hope you are listening to what I am saying, people of God.
    <br>As a Christian, you can be attacked but you can never be destroyed.
    <br>Satan is never permitted to block our way without the providence of God making a way out.
    <br>If satan today brings iron to block your way,
    <br>look left, look right, look back, look front, you don't see any way out,
    <br>God will bring a welder to cut a way out through the iron.
    <br>1 Corinthians 10:13:
    <br>"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man;
    <br>but God is faithful and He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear
    <br>but with it, will provide a way out."
    <br>In fact, if we are on God's agenda, in line with God's will, God's Word,
    <br>often the very things that seem an abortion of God's plan are actually the road to it's fulfillment.
    <br>What you look at as the end, with Christ, it will open the door to new beginnings.
    <br>But the problem lies when you step out of your way, out of your duty, out of God’s agenda.
    <br>Then you forfeit His promise and put yourselves out of God’s protection.
    <br>The promise of God that says, "I will be with you.
    <br>Even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil for I will be with you".
    <br>When you step out of God's will, out of God's agenda,
    <br>you forfeit the promise and you are on your own.
    <br>Our natural strength cannot defeat satan in battle.
    <br>When you tempt the devil to tempt you,
    <br>you provoke God to withdraw His strength and leave you to your own strength.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't tempt the devil to tempt you".
    <br>Now I want to try and use an illustration to gain great understanding of this principle.
    <br>And for this illustration, I need three volunteers, male volunteers.
    <br>Oh, there we go, three straight, Thank you very much, brethren.
    <br>The language I want to use to demonstrate this example is a language that is universal.
    <br>The language of football.
    <br>Where are you from, sir?
    <br>From Lagos.
    <br>Nigeria.
    <br>Akwa Ibom.
    <br>From Spain.
    <br>Wow, we have a bit of a world cup here.
    <br>Now, brother from Spain, if you come with me.
    <br>We are going to split ourselves into two teams.
    <br>Just turn around and face the crowd, sir.
    <br>We are going to split ourselves into two teams.
    <br>This is Team Jesus.
    <br>Here is Team Satan.
    <br>Very sorry, brother; just for now, just for a moment.
    <br>We want to have a very quick exercise that will help illustrate this principle of what it means
    <br>when you tempt the devil to tempt you.
    <br>Ok, so this is our playing ground. This is our ball.
    <br>All of us have played some street football before, especially the men.
    <br>Irrespective of  where you are from - we all know how to play football on the streets.
    <br>Alright, so let's make the goal a little bit bigger, a little bit easier.
    <br>So the aim of this game is very simple.
    <br>I and my brother here - Team Jesus - we want to score in this goal.
    <br>Team Satan wants to score in this goal.
    <br>I think the easiest way to  do this is with a whistle.
    <br>Another rule I forgot to tell you.
    <br>I am playing in this game but I'm also explaining the sermon.
    <br>So any time you hear this whistle, pause.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Crowd, I hope you are going to support Team Jesus.
    <br>If we see people cheering for Team Satan, don't worry - we will pray for you later for your deliverance.
    <br>Come, my brother. Ok. Three, two, one - go.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok, the ball is with Team Satan. Come on, Team Satan, let's see if we can...
    <br>I see skills.
    <br>Ok, no problem.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We got the ball again.
    <br>Oh, look at that. Come on!
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Goal!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brilliant! Alright.
    <br>Don't worry, the example is still coming. We have to score a goal first.
    <br>1:0 Team Jesus. Ok, come on then guys, let's go.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yeah, this guy is good.
    <br>Ok, now watch this.
    <br>Hold on.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What just happened?
    <br>Team Satan is my enemy, my adversary, my opponent but I just gave him the ball.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I just gave him the ball. We are on the opposite side.
    <br>I gave him the ball and don't be surprised if he strikes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He scored! Why did Team Satan score?
    <br>Why?
    <br>Why do you complain when satan strikes when you are the one that gives him the ball?
    <br>Each time you go where Jesus is not welcomed, you give him the ball.
    <br>Each time you listen to what you know is corruptive and destructive to your spirit,
    <br>you give him the ball.
    <br>Each time you as a married man ask for a phone number from that lady you met,
    <br>you give him the ball.
    <br>Each time you are on your computer, your laptop, your phone and a pornographic advert comes up,
    <br>which says, "Click here to see more" and you look to your left, look to your right and click,
    <br>you give him the ball.
    <br>Each time you put a password on your phone that even your wife doesn't know
    <br>because what you are doing on there, you don't even want your own wife to know what you are doing,
    <br>you give satan the ball.
    <br>Don't be surprised when he strikes.
    <br>Don't be surprised if he scores because he is a very good attacker.
    <br>He is a very good striker.
    <br>Don't tempt the devil to tempt you.
    <br>Do you know what we as people of God are supposed to do? I will tell you what.
    <br>We are not even supposed to be playing games with Team Satan.
    <br>We are children of God - what is our business with them?
    <br>When we see that they have come into our heart, do you know what you are supposed to do?
    <br>Out! Go!
    <br>Send them out.
    <br>Give them a red card. Send him out.
    <br>You have no business with him.
    <br>When you send him out of the way, there is no way -  you can score.
    <br>But today, many of us, what we do, we give satan just a yellow card.
    <br>"I will give you another chance, satan. I will give you a warning. Let's try again."
    <br>You give him a yellow card, instead of you to take your position in the believer's authority,
    <br>'You satan, you have no business in my life, my family, my marriage, my career. Get out!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It was a good game so we have to compensate our brethren.
    <br>I think Team Jesus won 2:1.
    <br>Please come and take an altar fruit as a blessing for your life.
    <br>We will not give you a red card on the altar. Don't worry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No mortal man or devil can supersede the plan of God for your life.
    <br>There is only one person who can get you out of the will of God -  and that is you.
    <br>That is you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>One of the greatest gifts God has given us is the freedom to make decisions.
    <br>All of us who have fallen made a decision
    <br>and all of us who have not fallen faced a similar temptation and made a different decision.
    <br>It is not our challenges, temptations, troubles that make us fall;
    <br>it is our reaction to them.
    <br>While some of us yield to the pressure and make wrong decisions,
    <br>others face the same pressure and make the right decisions.
    <br>Whoever you yield yourself to obey, that is whose servant you are.
    <br>Romans 6:16.
    <br>Brethren, our heart is a treasury.
    <br>Luke 6:45 says that a good man brings forth good things out of the good that is stored up in his heart
    <br>but an evil man brings forth evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
    <br>What are you storing up in your heart?
    <br>Pride or humility?
    <br>Love or hatred?
    <br>Offence or forgiveness?
    <br>What you store up in your heart will be revealed at the point of temptation.
    <br>Temptation provokes what you are hiding, what you are storing.
    <br>What you have been keeping in your heart provokes that temptation.
    <br>That your weakness comes out in the face of temptation.
    <br>What you have been keeping, hiding, harbouring in your heart.
    <br>Look at Judas Iscariot in the Bible - the betrayer.
    <br>Judas Iscariot  lived and walked with Jesus
    <br>He was one of the twelve that Jesus sent out to heal the sick and deliver the demon-possessed.
    <br>He heard the teachings, he saw the miracles, he lived with Jesus.
    <br>But the Bible says in John 12:4-6 that Judas Iscariot harboured the secret sin of stealing.
    <br>He took from the money bag when no one was looking.
    <br>What he harboured in his heart gave satan a foothold to enter
    <br>and manipulate him to the point of betraying the Son of God.
    <br>Cain - you know the story of Cain and Abel in the Bible.
    <br>Let's quickly turn there; turn to the Book of Genesis.
    <br>Genesis 4:7.
    <br>You know, Cain gave an unworthy offering -
    <br>an offering to honour himself and dishonour God.
    <br>God was not happy; God told him in that Genesis 4:7,
    <br>"If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?
    <br>But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door;
    <br>it desires to have you but you must rule over it."
    <br>Even with this warning from God, because Cain bore a grudge against his brother Abel,
    <br>because God accepted Abel's offering,
    <br>satan had a foothold in his heart and manipulated him to the point of murdering his own brother.
    <br>On the contrary, Joseph - we know the story of Joseph.
    <br>Do you know the reason why Joseph did not succumb to the temptation from Potiphar's wife?
    <br>Potiphar's wife was trying to seduce Joseph, wanted to sleep with him at all cost.
    <br>Do you know the reason why Joseph did not give in or yield or submit to that temptation?
    <br>He knew who he was; he was a child with a promise of God.
    <br>I tell you today - you are children of promise.
    <br>You are children of destiny.
    <br>You are children with a promise from God.
    <br>Your destiny does not permit you to give your heart to fleshly desires.
    <br>Your destiny, your promise from God is too precious to be corrupted, tainted, perverted.
    <br>Your destiny does not permit you.
    <br>Consider your destiny.
    <br>Your destiny does not allow you to waste time on things that have no lasting value and significance.
    <br>Your destiny does not permit you to strive and struggle against flesh and blood.
    <br>Consider your destiny.
    <br>Be God conscious.
    <br>Cultivate a consciousness of God.
    <br>If you are conscious of God, your heart will not rest until it rests in Him.
    <br>You go where Jesus will not be welcomed -
    <br>your spirit will be agitated until you leave that place.
    <br>You have a conversation with someone and you sense a satanic influence - you will quickly cut it off.
    <br>But today, the problem is that satan's traps for us are often hidden.
    <br>He would disguise himself as an angel of light and come with his hidden agenda.
    <br>It takes the grace, the strength of one grounded in the Word of God,
    <br>to be able to identify the devil's tricks for what they are.
    <br>If you ask any man here, "Will you sleep with a snake?",
    <br>he will say, "No, over my dead body!"
    <br>Satan knows that so he will put a spirit of snake inside a beautiful lady.
    <br>By the time you meet them, it's not just your bodies that meet; it's your spirits.
    <br>No physical protection can withstand spiritual contamination.
    <br>Many destinies have been diverted, many homes broken, many lives shattered
    <br>because we've given our hearts away to fleshly desires.
    <br>I'm coming to a conclusion, brethren, but I want to tell you something that happened to me;
    <br>how God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to preserve my life.
    <br>When I came here to The SCOAN as a visitor, many many years ago;
    <br>I was in the prayer line, I was about 14-15 years old.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua walked up to me and gave me a word of prophecy.
    <br>He walked up, looked at me and said," Young man, there is a lady that you are close to,
    <br>and you have to be very careful because she is demon-possessed".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I didn't do that on the outside.
    <br>You know when you receive a prophecy, you say, "Yes, Man of God, it's true".
    <br>But within me, I was like, "Ah! What? There is a lady close to me that is possessed?"
    <br>In fact, I began to think, "Maybe it is this one. Oh my God, what is happening?"
    <br>You should have seen me when I got back to UK.
    <br>If a lady came close to me, "Be gone from me, you satan!"
    <br>I quickly gave her the red card because I was so scared that someone would come.
    <br>This is Prophet T.B. Joshua who had told me; I didn't know who the person was.
    <br>But that prophecy preserved me from making a stupid mistake.
    <br>As a young man, you know the temptations that we face -
    <br>peer pressure, temptations up and down, here and there.
    <br>Anytime this temptation would come, I would remember what the Prophet had told me,
    <br>"There is a lady that is close to you. She is demon-possessed".
    <br>"Ay! Ok, I’m gone! Goodbye. Thank you."
    <br>Leave the place just like Joseph. Get out.
    <br>When Joseph was tempted, he didn't just stay there; he got out.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Get out before sin gets in".
    <br>If you ask Samson, he will tell you -  a night of pleasure is not worth a lifetime of blindness.
    <br>In conclusion, brethren:
    <br>The truth of this sermon is enough to change your life.
    <br>But don't just listen to this sermon; study the sermon of your own life.
    <br>Your life experience will testify to this truth.
    <br>Poison is poison, irrespective of how it is packaged.
    <br>Please, don't tempt the devil to tempt you.
    <br>Life already has enough challenges.
    <br>You are a Christian; you have declared war against satan.
    <br>There are already enough challenges in life for you to create one for yourself -
    <br>to create your own trouble, challenge, temptation.
    <br>Jesus said to His disciples, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>It means He knew situations would come that would test them, tempt them
    <br>and try to remove them from their faith
    <br>but He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>This means, our faith may fail but not fall off.
    <br>If faith is kept up in the hour of temptation, though we are cast down, we will not be utterly destroyed.
    <br>And if God allows it, it will not lead to our end, to our downfall.
    <br>It will lead to our promotion.
    <br>Just stay in line with the will of God.
    <br>And He is there to see you through whatever life brings.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
