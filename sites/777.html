  <p>    
    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for the people in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>He encounters this lady and the power of God exposes whatever that is not of God in her life.
    <br>Let's see how she was delivered.
    <br>I want blood.
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>You want what?
    <br>Blood!
    <br>You want blood?
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>I want to kill.
    <br>What have you done to her career and her family?
    <br>Speak!
    <br>I split.
    <br>Speak loud, you demon!
    <br>I split.
    <br>You split the family?
    <br>I split.
    <br>How many are you in this body?
    <br>Eleven.
    <br>Who is number one?
    <br>Number one!
    <br>Death.
    <br>Number two?
    <br>Spirit of what?
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>Look at this man. Who is this man to you?
    <br>She married him.
    <br>She married him?
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>A man.
    <br>You are a man?
    <br>What can you say about your wife?
    <br>She is my wife; she has been struggling.
    <br>She has been afflicted for quite a while.
    <br>Who is the cause of the troubles in the marriage?
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>Who is the cause of their troubles?
    <br>I am.
    <br>You are the cause?
    <br>How long have you been in her?
    <br>Since birth.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>In a dream.
    <br>In a dream?
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua offers spirit-filled prayer to her,
    <br>and the evil spirit flees at the mention of the name Jesus Christ.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>She is free in Jesus' name.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Danielle Amy and I am from Australia.
    <br>The man beside me is my lovely husband Trevor.
    <br>You are both very welcome.
    <br>All the way from Australia - you've really come a long way.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is the rewarder.
    <br>You have been delivered as we saw on the screen.
    <br>We want to hear from you about how those evil spirits have been affecting your life.
    <br>Please, go ahead with your testimony.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was that
    <br>I had been struggling with my health and had been diagnosed
    <br>with several autoimmune diseases and disorders.
    <br>My family members are quite sick and I was looking at them.
    <br>I just believed that God had more for myself and my family
    <br>and I wasn't going to take "no" for an answer.
    <br>We applied to come to The SCOAN to receive healing and deliverance.
    <br>Our sister mentioned that she came not only due to the evil attacks she was facing
    <br>but also because she had some eating disorders and allergies that had been affecting her life.
    <br>Please go ahead and let us know how these problems had affected you.
    <br>Autoimmune is when the body attacks itself.
    <br>I was constantly being diagnosed with different problems within my body
    <br>because my body kept on attacking different areas.
    <br>It was just exhausting.
    <br>I would spend the majority of my time by myself or in bed because I was just beyond exhausted.
    <br>The Lord has healed me.
    <br>Since the deliverance and healing, I haven't taken any of the medications that I usually take on a daily basis.
    <br>I feel a lot better, I have a lot more of energy.
    <br>Let's put our hands for Jesus!
    <br>You mentioned that you were having some different health-wise problems
    <br>but it was as a result of the evil attacks you had been facing.
    <br>You mentioned that you went to the doctors and they kept diagnosing different problems with you.
    <br>Can you explain more about the evil attacks you experienced and how they affected you?
    <br>I had been having evil attacks.
    <br>The first one that I remember was when I was about five or six years of age.
    <br>I've been having them throughout my entire life - either in dreams or visions but often in the physical.
    <br>Sometimes, I would just wake up from my sleep and I would have bruises and strangle marks around my neck.
    <br>I would have bites on my body in places that I wouldn't be able to reach by myself.
    <br>I would have bruises and scratches all over me.
    <br>I would have evil spirits come and visit me and speak to me when I was awake like I am now.
    <br>OK. You mentioned that when you woke up, you would physically see bruises and scratches on your body
    <br>in places that you couldn't reach yourself,
    <br>letting you know that something else had been doing these things to you.
    <br>Yes, that's correct.
    <br>Did you ever explain these things to the doctors in Australia?
    <br>No.
    <br>I actually felt quite ashamed and isolated.
    <br>There are very few people that I would actually share this with
    <br>because I guess culturally, it's very different in Australia.
    <br>If I ever told the doctor how I got the bruises or some of the injuries I'd sustained,
    <br>which actually led to me being hospitalized,
    <br>I was afraid that I would be institutionalized because they would think I was insane.
    <br>Did you explain these things to your husband?
    <br>Yes, I did but he began to encounter them for himself.
    <br>He was a witness after we got married.
    <br>You mentioned that you would also see them physically, not just in the dream.
    <br>Can you give us an instance of when this happened to you?
    <br>I had one night just after we got married.
    <br>I wasn't able to sleep so I went into another room to lay down.
    <br>I fell asleep and I had a dream.
    <br>There were three beings standing in my room and they were talking about how I was going to die.
    <br>I was going to be involved in a car accident but it wasn't the car accident that was going to kill me -
    <br>it was a ruptured artery that was going to kill me.
    <br>I woke up from the dream because I heard talking, and I physically saw the three beings standing before me.
    <br>Can you describe what you saw standing before you?
    <br>They were tall and dark in appearance.
    <br>I saw like a shimmering green as if they had green coats or capes on, although it was very dark in the room.
    <br>The room was very cold.
    <br>I just felt...
    <br>Any way to describe it - it is just death.
    <br>Danielle Amy & Husband - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I called my husband.
    <br>He came in and commented that there was something wrong, before I even said to him what had happened.
    <br>We began to pray.
    <br>We both got up and went into our dining area.
    <br>We had a big book case.
    <br>On top of the book case were several candles.
    <br>One of the candles had been taken down and put on the kitchen bench.
    <br>A green flame was burning in the candle.
    <br>Neither my husband or I had touched the candle.
    <br>Neither of us had brought it down or lit the flame.
    <br>We felt such an evil presence in the house.
    <br>You mentioned just before that the three beings were standing there
    <br>and you heard them discussing a plan of how to kill you
    <br>but your husband walked in and said something was not right.
    <br>Did he see the beings as well at that time?
    <br>No, he didn't.
    <br>After praying together, we went back to bed together.
    <br>I was laying awake.
    <br>My husband fell asleep.
    <br>While I was lying there, this being came over me and began to scream violently in my face.
    <br>My husband woke up from his sleep, rebuking in Jesus' name.
    <br>He turned to me describing what he had just seen, what had just happened in his dream.
    <br>What he had seen in his dream was exactly what I had witnessed being awake as I was laying.
    <br>What you experienced physically; a demon shouting over your head -
    <br>your husband saw it happening too, as he was sleeping but he woke up rebuking this demon in Jesus' name?
    <br>Yes, that is correct.
    <br>What happened after that?
    <br>At that time I wasn't working because I was quite unwell.
    <br>I had a friend that was also unwell and I wanted to cook for her and her family.
    <br>I made food and put it in the car to go.
    <br>As I was driving, I went to turn down the street to her house.
    <br>Out of nowhere, a car came and hit me and totaled the car that I was in.
    <br>I hit my head and hurt my neck but I didn't want to go to hospital so I just went home.
    <br>My husband came home to be with me.
    <br>As I was laying on the couch, because I was in quite a bit of pain,
    <br>a sort of a tiger came and bit me on the neck.
    <br>I was in excruciating pain and I couldn't move.
    <br>My heart was not beating properly and I had pain down my arms.
    <br>I was admitted into hospital, into emergency.
    <br>OK, sorry...
    <br>We just want to get some thing clear from you.
    <br>You mentioned that after having that strange encounter that day,
    <br>listening to evil beings explaining how they planned to kill you in a car crash,
    <br>the very same day, as you were in your car on your way to drop some food to a sick friend,
    <br>you had a car accident.
    <br>Then you went home and you said a tiger came in and bit your neck.
    <br>Were you sleeping that time when you saw a tiger coming in or was it physically?
    <br>Yes, that was physically.
    <br>I hadn't been asleep.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The only way to describe it is like when you have a fire and there is smoke -
    <br>it was the same density and texture but very clear and there were colours.
    <br>It came and bit me.
    <br>So, the tiger physically came into where you were?
    <br>Yes, it did.
    <br>What happened after you went to the hospital?
    <br>I was admitted for five days in intensive care.
    <br>They weren't able to find out what the problem was.
    <br>I was in such a bad pain I couldn't get out of the bed to go to the bathroom, or anything.
    <br>They couldn't relieve the pain so they accidentally knocked me with too much pain relievers.
    <br>I ended up going catatonic and unresponsive for a period.
    <br>Just before that happened, whilst receiving one of the injections,
    <br>again, I saw the tiger come and bite me.
    <br>Eventually, they ended up doing an MRI scan.
    <br>They found that the muscles around my artery and neck had been constricted.
    <br>They were concerned that it was going to cause a stroke.
    <br>They couldn't work out what was causing it.
    <br>The doctors couldn't understand what was happening to you.
    <br>You mentioned that they gave you so much medication that your whole body became unresponsive
    <br>and you were in a critical condition.
    <br>Yes, that's correct.
    <br>At first I was showing no signs at all that the medication was affecting me negatively or positively.
    <br>There was a "build up" in my system and it ended up just hitting me in one go.
    <br>So, at this point you realized that your problem had gone beyond human solution, beyond physical means?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I knew that it was spiritual.
    <br>I'd known all my life that it was spiritual.
    <br>I became desperate for a breakthrough.
    <br>I believed that God heals, delivers, and He is a good God.
    <br>We decided that we wanted to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>We made an application to come.
    <br>How did you find out about The SCOAN?
    <br>About a year after this attack, my husband and I were looking at some things on Youtube.
    <br>I don't think it was related but we ended up seeing a video pop-up.
    <br>At first we didn't want to click on it because we thought it might be evil
    <br>but we decided to click on it anyway and our lives were changed as a result.
    <br>So instantly, when you started watching videos from The SCOAN, your life began to change?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Our house was filled with peace.
    <br>Instead of feeling a demonic presence, we began to feel an angelic presence.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for Emmanuel TV - one of the means He is using to change lives.
    <br>Finally, you and your husband came to The SCOAN for your deliverance.
    <br>Can you share with us what happened on the day when you received the prayer and the deliverance?
    <br>Watching the video is actually quite surreal.
    <br>I just got hit and it was on my slack and I was stunned.
    <br>I guess any way to describe it is like I was behind a pane of glass and a 3D movie was happening
    <br>around me but there was no interaction on my behalf.
    <br>I heard talking but it was like I was waiting to hear what someone else was saying.
    <br>There was a strange voice coming that I was hearing.
    <br>As you were receiving the deliverance you saw that there was a spiritual warfare going on at that time?
    <br>Yes, I did.
    <br>Now, you are delivered.
    <br>What are the differences that you have noticed in your life?
    <br>I am a lot more peaceful.
    <br>I haven't had any more evil attacks or spiritual visitations.
    <br>I have just got a lot more energy.
    <br>My body feels really good.
    <br>My appetite has got a lot better as well.
    <br>Glory be to God! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We want to hear a few words from your husband standing beside you,
    <br>what he would like to say about the experiences, what he noticed in your life previously and now
    <br>that you are delivered in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please go ahead, starting with your name and what you have to say
    <br>about what God has done in the life of your wife.
    <br>My name is Trevor Philips and I'm from Australia.
    <br>Just to testify to the goodness of God...
    <br>Prior to my wife's deliverance and encounter with the Father,
    <br>she was experiencing a lot of demonic, evil attacks, frustration, stress, serious health conditions
    <br>that medically could not be resolved.
    <br>Visits to different doctors just led to dead ends.
    <br>After her deliverance by the grace of God, she is full of peace, radiant, calm, relaxed.
    <br>She just seems overall like a different person.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together!
    <br>That is the evidence of Jesus Christ: lives changed.
    <br>Madam, we'd love to hear from you once again.
    <br>We want to hear your words of advice for others
    <br>because we believe that many people have been going through a similar thing.
    <br>We believe you have some words of advice to encourage them.
    <br>My advice especially to people of the "Western world" is that the spiritual realm is a reality.
    <br>I believe that there are a lot of people who have suffered in similar ways as I did.
    <br>But Jesus has conquered the enemy.
    <br>Jesus has given us salvation.
    <br>He has delivered us and He has healed us.
    <br>I think it is important that we allow Him to save us, to heal us, to deliver us because He is more than capable.
    <br>He is total in His healing, His deliverance and His salvation.
    <br>There is no partiality about it.
    <br>He is amazing.
    <br>Amen! Let's clap for our Lord!
    <br>Danielle Amy & Husband - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>He is amazing indeed.
    <br>He has totally transformed the life of this lady.
    <br>You mentioned before that you had an eating disorder, some allergies,
    <br>you were taking a lot of medication as a result of this.
    <br>How about now? 
    <br>How is your physical health?
    <br>I feel really good.
    <br>I have got a lot of energy, strength and stamina that I didn't have before.
    <br>My appetite has returned.
    <br>For the benefit of the viewers;
    <br>we also want to ask once again about the time when Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for you
    <br>and the spiritual warfare was going on.
    <br>Can you explain how you felt at that time?
    <br>What happened to you at that time of deliverance?
    <br>It was like I was just removed, like I was in "echo" of something that was happening.
    <br>It was like me as a person was lagging behind whatever was going on, whatever warfare was happening.
    <br>Spiritually, it was like it all was one second delayed for me, and I was watching it after it had happened.
    <br>I guess the way to describe it is that my body felt stunned.
    <br>Actually, there was like a hand upon my head, upon my forehead for quite a while afterwards.
    <br>It was very soothing and comforting.
    <br>When the man of God delivered you, you fell to the ground.
    <br>How did you feel when you got up?
    <br>I felt a bit disoriented about what just happened but I felt really good and like "lighter".
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Him!
    <br>Do you mean that today you are completely delivered and free?
    <br>I'm free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for allowing us to eat of the fruit of your life.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>"Thank you" is a response from a happy and free heart.
    <br>Let's put our hands together one more time!
