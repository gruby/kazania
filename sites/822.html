    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>On Sunday May 7th 2017, during The SCOAN Live Sunday Service,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy concerning the outcome of the 2017 French Presidential Election,
    <br>shortly before the results were officially announced.
    <br>These were his words:
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name we pray.
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>There is so much uproar in the French-speaking country.
    <br>We look at the two candidates.
    <br>But for me, immigrants, refugees - because my Father in Heaven was once a refugee too.
    <br>So, we pray for any one of them who supports refugees – like Emmanuel Macron.
    <br>We are praying for him and our prayer will
    <br>answer!
    <br>I will leave it; I will not say more than that.
    <br>It is prayer that will put him there, not
    <br>anything –
    <br>because of his heart for refugees and immigrants.
    <br>Half of this world are immigrants and refugees.
    <br>Where will they go?
    <br>I pray every day for Emmanuel Macron.
    <br>I am not a politician - because of what he believes.
    <br>What he believes is what my Father in Heaven
    <br>believes.
    <br>We will see what we can do to protect these refugees and immigrants.
    <br>Many of them – it is not their will to leave
    <br>their country; it is the war.
    <br>When there is war, you run helter-skelter - anywhere you know you can run to.
    <br>But we know there are some bad people among the refugees.
    <br>But we cannot say because there are some bad people that we reject all of them. No!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am not saying you should pray for him.
    <br>Me – I am praying for him, Emmanuel Macron,
    <br>because of what he believes.
    <br>I listened to his profile – his belief about
    <br>the refugees and immigrants.
    <br>Today is declaration.
    <br>I am praying, not you; I am not saying you because we are not playing politics in the Church.
    <br>That is just what I believe; thank you.
