  <p>    
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Good Morning Church.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>BELIEF IN HIS WORD
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>BELIEF IN HIS WORD
    <br>You begin to believe the Word of God when it dominates your heart.
    <br>No amount of Word of God in your mouth can influence your conduct and character.
    <br>No matter how brilliant you are in committing your memory without your heart.
    <br>It is when it dominates your heart, you begin to believe.
    <br>You begin to believe when the Word dominates your heart.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>It is when the Word of God dominates your heart, you can go forth and go on
    <br>in the discharge of our Christian duty.
    <br>When the Word of God dominates your heart,
    <br>you can go forth and go on in the discharge of your Christian duty.
    <br>The words we preach, the words we say in counsel, in prayer, in teaching
    <br>must be according to God's Spirit.
    <br>The more you think more about what you read,
    <br>the more your heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>I said, "The more you think more..." - not just thinking because...
    <br>Faith prevails over thinking process.
    <br>But thinking more...
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>The more you think more about what you read in the Bible...
    <br>How do we think more?
    <br>When your passion and all of you is carried along while reading.
    <br>You may be reading and at the same time your mind would be somewhere.
    <br>While you are reading, you keep thinking of your situation, that you are sick or business failure;
    <br>your handset is beside you somewhere; you are expecting a call from your debtor
    <br>and you are reading your Bible.
    <br>Mind will be telling you, "When this man will call me? When will I receive this call?"
    <br>For you to think more, your passion and all of you must be carried along while reading the Bible.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>All of you must be carried along when you read the Bible - you must turn off your handset.
    <br>It means you are done with the things on the outside,
    <br>you want to receive the food for the spirit.
    <br>You know what it means?
    <br>When you are eating food, you enjoy it.
    <br>When you are lucky to eat a food, you enjoy it.
    <br>While you are eating it and someone is calling you - you may not answer.
    <br>Your passion and all of you will be there.
    <br>In the same vein, for you to think more -
    <br>while reading, your passion and all of you must be carried along.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of John 6.
    <br>Let's take a look at verse 63; I will first of all read from verse 1.
    <br>"After this, Jesus crossed over to the far side of the Sea of Galilee,
    <br>also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
    <br>A huge crowd kept following him wherever he went,
    <br>because they saw his miraculous signs as he healed the sick."
    <br>Let's go to verse 63.
    <br>"The Spirit alone gives eternal life.
    <br>Human effort accomplishes nothing.
    <br>And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The more you think more, the more your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>If your spirit has not acted upon the Word, the Word will remain on your lips.
    <br>And I told you there is no amount of Word is your mouth that can change you.
    <br>It is when the Word dominates our heart that it can influence our conduct and our character.
    <br>That is why today you can see many preaching the Word powerfully, but
    <br>we cannot do anything with the Word.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord..." - we preach powerfully but we can't loose or bind.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>We preach...
    <br>Every Word of God is Spirit and life.
    <br>When we receive and obey the Word of God, the power of God works in us.
    <br>This means, the Word of God becomes the power of God.
    <br>How does the power of God work in us?
    <br>The power of God begins to work in us when we think more
    <br>about what we read in the Bible.
    <br>The more we think more about what we read,
    <br>the more our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>When our spirit acts upon the Word, the Word becomes part of us.
    <br>When something becomes part of you, you can loose, bind - it becomes an instrument.
    <br>Like this - it is part of you.
    <br>This one is part of me...
    <br>I can...
    <br>But if it is not part of me, it is not an instrument.
    <br>Take note of what we are talking of.
    <br>Every Word of God is Spirit and life.
    <br>When we receive and obey the Word of God that is Spirit and life,
    <br>the power of God works in us.
    <br>This means, the Word of God becomes the power of God.
    <br>How do we have this power of God?
    <br>We have the power of God when we think more
    <br>about what we read in the Bible.
    <br>Not thinking because faith prevails over thinking processes.
    <br>When we think more...
    <br>To think more is to meditate.
    <br>When you are thinking, you cannot think above your situation.
    <br>All you would think about, "My health, business, home, husband, wife, setback, challenges...",
    <br>you would compare yourself with others, measuring yourself - these are the things you think about.
    <br>You think about your age, "Look at my age. My colleagues made it. See me - I'm still there."
    <br>Your limited education...
    <br>These are the things you would think about.
    <br>You can't think about that - it is not possible.
    <br>When you think more, you will begin to think when this life is over,
    <br>what happens next?
    <br>Think more about what will start when this life is over.
    <br>What else?
    <br>When today is your last day on earth, what next?
    <br>That is 'think more'.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>People keep asking me, "How do we have faith?"
    <br>In our messages everyday:
    <br>You must know God.
    <br>Before you can have a foundation for faith, you must know God.
    <br>Faith does not originate in us; faith originates with God.
    <br>Faith does not originate in us; it does not originate in saints, apostles of the old.
    <br>If faith originates in us, it will become fragile, weak
    <br>because we have an end and we have a beginning.
    <br>We and apostles - we have an end, we have a beginning -
    <br>the day you were born and the day you will die.
    <br>Faith will die if faith originates in us.
    <br>It would suddenly die.
    <br>Faith does not originate in us; you cannot find faith in yourself.
    <br>Faith originates with God.
    <br>God has no beginning; He has no end.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>If faith originates with God, how do we get faith?
    <br>You must know God.
    <br>If you know God, you will simultaneously have faith.
    <br>How do we know God?
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>You say, "Where is God? I can't see God."
    <br>By the Word He speaks.
    <br>The Word He speaks represents His heart's desire.
    <br>If you see any ministers of God that say,
    <br>"Be delivered! Be healed!" -
    <br>it is not God, it is human being like you
    <br>but the word he spoke - if there is 'before and after' -
    <br>he speaks it and it happens - God is that Word.
    <br>When God said, "Let there be light", assume there was no light, He's not God.
    <br>He said, "Let there be light" and there was light.
    <br>That made Him God.
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks.
    <br>The Word He speaks represents His heart's desire.
    <br>How do I have faith?
    <br>I have faith when I know God
    <br>and that faith continues to grow simultaneously
    <br>as I continue to look unto God, look at God, meditate on God.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You want me to take you back again?
    <br>How do we have faith?
    <br>You have faith when you know God.
    <br>Faith continues to grow as we continue to look unto God, look at God, meditate on God.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>If you know God, you will simultaneously have faith.
    <br>It grows...
    <br>Look at the case of a farmer; like we have read in the Book of John 6:63...
    <br>When a farmer gets his seed into the ground,
    <br>he does not dig it up every day to see how it is doing.
    <br>We are all farmers - that is where we all came from.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When a farmer gets his seed into the ground, soil,
    <br>he does not dig it up every day to see how it is doing.
    <br>He believes it is OK, it is settled.
    <br>If a farmer could have faith in nature, we Christians must have faith
    <br>in the imperishable Seed.
    <br>They have faith in nature but we must have faith in the God of nature -
    <br>imperishable Seed, the Word of God.
    <br>They have faith without any definite promise.
    <br>There is no assurance.
    <br>They carry their seed and make some heaps...
    <br>Some make heaps and dig the ground and put their seed inside.
    <br>They have faith without any definite promise.
    <br>They believe.
    <br>"Tomorrow it will germinate. Next week it will germinate." - No.
    <br>It could vary; it depends on the soil.
    <br>The rain may not fall and the weather may not be OK for the seed.
    <br>So, they have many challenges that would actually frustrate their crops.
    <br>But yet - they have faith!
    <br>You will never see a farmer coming everyday to dig up and see whether the seed is growing.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Why don't we Christians have faith in the God of nature?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Why not have faith in the God of nature?"
    <br>Your father has faith in nature.
    <br>Not even your father - you; that is what brought you up.
    <br>90% of us came from village.
    <br>I say 90% of us here were brought up by farmers.
    <br>You were educated, sent to school, given scholarship by these farmers.
    <br>Your upbringing from cattle rearers, farming...
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>But you suddenly forgot your roots.
    <br>You were brought up in that way.
    <br>Until now, many of us are still in that business.
    <br>You have faith in nature, but now, to have faith in the God of nature - problem.
    <br>Everyday you want to dig up to see whether God is at work.
    <br>If I'm talking to you...
    <br>Everyday you want to look at your bank account to see whether the money is increasing.
    <br>Every day, when I say, "Be healed!" - after healing you look back and say, "I'm healed";
    <br>following day you are going to doctor to check your blood, your kidney.
    <br>You want to dig up to see whether God is actually working.
    <br>You come with your medical report, "Heal me".
    <br>"Be healed, in Jesus' name!" - "Amen."
    <br>I say, "You are healed"...
    <br>Walk!
    <br>That is not walk, you are jumping.
    <br>Even you who are fit - you can't jump.
    <br>Suddenly, you are healed - "Walk!" - you started jumping.
    <br>It is still an element of doubting, "If I'm healed, I should be able to jump, not only walk".
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Everyday you dig up to see whether God is at work
    <br>but your fathers, when they get the seed into the ground,
    <br>they would never dig up to see how the seed is doing.
    <br>They believe it is well, it is settled, it is doing well.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Rise up...
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Ask God to give you grace not to be ignorant of your faith
    <br>under any pressure of sickness, temptation, setback, poverty, hardship.
    <br>Ask God, "Give me the grace not to be ignorant of my faith
    <br>under pressure of temptation, sickness, disease."
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Not to be ignorant!
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Look at what I'm saying now:
    <br>ignorance of your faith under the pressure of sickness.
    <br>You are here; you say, "Jesus, heal me".
    <br>The man of God says, "You are healed, in Jesus' name"...
    <br>Look at what happened to the man at the Beautiful Gate.
    <br>Peter and John - when they saw this man at the Beautiful Gate begging;
    <br>he was stretching hand to collect the money.
    <br>Peter said, "Silver, gold I have not. What I have I give you - in the name of Jesus, rise and walk".
    <br>The crippled man was looking at them.
    <br>"I said, 'Rise and walk' "
    <br>He refused to rise and walk because he was ignorant of his faith.
    <br>Peter tapped and pushed him, "Rise and walk" - money is not everything.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>In the same vein today, "Be healed, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>and what you could not do before - you start to dance...
    <br>Upon that, immediately you get home, you are going to your doctor again,
    <br>"Check me here, take my blood. Do I still have those traces of blood? Are you sure?"
    <br>After that you go to see another doctor.
    <br>You are digging up everyday to see whether God is really working the miracle.
    <br>If the farmer, after putting their seed in the soil...
    <br>Imagine they begin to dig it up to see how the seed is doing -
    <br>what would happen to the seed?
    <br>After putting the seed in the ground, you would never see them going there to dig it up,
    <br>to see how the seed was doing.
    <br>They believe it is alright, it is settled.
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Ask God, "Give me the grace not to be ignorant of my faith
    <br>under pressure and tension of sickness, disease, poverty, hardship"
    <br>because it is this pressure that caused it.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Not to be ignorant of your faith under pressure of sickness, disease, poverty.
    <br>ESSENTIAL Teaching On FAITH - TB Joshua
    <br>Open your lips.
