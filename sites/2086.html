  <p>    
    <br>Man of God, help me! I cannot walk!
    <br>My back has pain; my whole body has pain.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>- Is this your mom?
    <br>- They want to kill me.
    <br>They have operated on me two times.
    <br>The pain is so much, Man of God!
    <br>I cannot do anything.
    <br>It is alright.
    <br>Even at the back, I cannot do anything.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>Come on! Stand up! Stand right.
    <br>Who are you? Look here!
    <br>The evil spirit says, "She refused to serve me".
    <br>She refused to serve you. Who are you?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I'm a goddess".
    <br>Are you not surprised to hear what your mommy says?
    <br>- What do you want to do to her?
    <br>- The evil spirit says, "I want to destroy her".
    <br>- Why do you want to destroy her?
    <br>- The evil spirit says, "She is the pillar of the house".
    <br>Stand up! Come!
    <br>Ok, come on.
    <br>Our Lord Jesus Christ has delivered her spiritually from the hand of the enemy.
    <br>I am free!
    <br>And physically from the debilitating conditions of degenerative spine and osteoarthritis.
    <br>She is now walking in the light of God for the first time after nine years of inability to walk.
    <br>This is the transformative power of Jesus Christ!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Honourable Faith Orima Woko from Rivers State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am from Omoku town.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>was the degeneration of my spine and osteoarthritis in my two knees.
    <br>The pain was so severe that I could not walk.
    <br>They were the ones who had to bring me because I could not walk on my own.
    <br>But look at me now! Praise God!
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>We thank God for the amazing miracle in your life and just before you go further,
    <br>can you tell us who are the two people standing beside you?
    <br>The young man standing beside me is my first son, Engineer Gabriel Nathaniel.
    <br>The person next to him is my younger brother. He is the one that brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was in pain and agony.
    <br>I couldn't sleep.
    <br>All that I knew was that my food was just pain.
    <br>My name changed to "Pain", because I was crying all day and all night.
    <br>I couldn't do anything for my children.
    <br>I couldn't even do business.
    <br>I couldn't even pursue Politics, because it is a requirement of the job to follow up.
    <br>The severe pains in my legs did not allow me to walk.
    <br>This affected my life and that of my family -
    <br>everyone, including my loved ones: my husband, my sisters, my brother and my children.
    <br>We were all affected.
    <br>But thank God, I am free today!
    <br>I am free from pain.
    <br>I am free from crying.
    <br>I have gone to many hospitals in Nigeria, as well as outside Nigeria.
    <br>I have undergone surgeries, but they were unsuccessful.
    <br>I have gone from one prayer house to another in this country, but still they could not help me.
    <br>I have even taken native drugs from herbalists in order for me to walk, but to no avail.
    <br>Oh God of TB Joshua, thank You!
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>Even this picture in my hand is one of the MRI's that was taken outside Nigeria before my surgery took place.
    <br>But even after this, my problem was not sorted out.
    <br>I went for the first surgery; I went for the second time.
    <br>During the third time, they injected me six times in my spine in an effort to stop the pain, but to no avail.
    <br>Oh God of TB Joshua, thank You very much!
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>The knee braces were given to me by a doctor outside Nigeria.
    <br>I have used many of them, but I still was forced to wear them as the pain was still there.
    <br>I don't know how to thank God. The God of TB Joshua I say, "Thank You!".
    <br>We want to ask you, what was your experience that moment
    <br>when Prophet TB Joshua came up to you when you were in the vehicle, unable to walk, and he prayed for you?
    <br>What happened?
    <br>It was just as if there was fire.
    <br>When he touched me, there was fire on my back, from my head down to my toes.
    <br>And something left me immediately.
    <br>There was fire inside me.
    <br>And I couldn't even understand that thing that left me, because it was too fast.
    <br>Once the man of God touched me, it left me and I became light.
    <br>And the pains left me too.
    <br>The crying left me too.
    <br>Now I don't have any more pain.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the Miracle-working God.
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>Madam, we want to see you demonstrate your healing, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you stand up for us?
    <br>I will stand to the glory of Jehovah God who has made me to walk in the land of the living.
    <br>He has even given me strength to move like a soldier.
    <br>Jesus, thank You. God of TB Joshua, thank You.
    <br>You are a living God.
    <br>[Speaks in her own language]
    <br>I worship You.
    <br>Thank You for healing me.
    <br>[Speaks in her own language]
    <br>Jesus, thank You.
    <br>I am greeting Him in my language.
    <br>[Speaks in her own language]
    <br>Jesus, thank You, because You have done it.
    <br>No other man or doctor could do it.
    <br>Lord Jesus, thank You.
    <br>I have not taken drugs since the day of my healing and deliverance until today.
    <br>I have not taken any analgesic.
    <br>Jesus, thank You.
    <br>Even though I was using an analgesic, I was still not sleeping.
    <br>I was still crying.
    <br>But because of the touch of the man of God, I am free from pain.
    <br>Help me and thank the God of TB Joshua.
    <br>God of TB Joshua, thank You.
    <br>You are a living God.
    <br>Thank You.
    <br>- Hallelujah.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Nine years of inability to walk, terrible pain, was wiped away in an instant
    <br>and we can see the joy in our mother's life.
    <br>My advice: Believe in God.
    <br>It is not going from one prayer house to the other.
    <br>Come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>They are not collecting money; salvation is free.
    <br>He cured me for free.
    <br>He even assisted me when I said that I don't have anything.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>We thank God for this wonderful advice from our mother,
    <br>advising us to seek Jesus Christ.
    <br>And remember that salvation, healing, blessing are not for sale.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Engineer Nathaniel Gabriel. I am from Nigeria, Rivers State.
    <br>This is my mom, Honourable Faith Orima Woko.
    <br>Today is a very joyous day in my life indeed, and in the lives of our family.
    <br>The past nine years have not been easy.
    <br>Imagine a young man like me having to take my mother from the bedroom, driving her all around.
    <br>Her sickness affected my career.
    <br>In short, it has affected the whole family.
    <br>Because if she wanted to go out, I would have to drive her.
    <br>When she called me, I would have to leave my place of work or residence to go and pick her up,
    <br>carry her to the car or to move.
    <br>But to God be the glory, you can see she can now walk. Praise the Lord!
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>Actually, I was not a fan of Emmanuel TV at all. I was a 'doubting Thomas'.
    <br>Previously, if I saw Emmanuel TV, I would walk out of the place or look for something else.
    <br>I would tell them to change the television station.
    <br>But today, I am a living testimony. He said, "Test and believe".
    <br>And TB Joshua touched me that day.
    <br>Prior to that day, my brother here told me that
    <br>if the man of God should touch me, it would feel like a warm bag of cement was thrown at me.
    <br>I told him that that was not possible with just one hand.
    <br>He said that even if the wisemen or any of the evangelists should touch me...
    <br>I said, "It cannot happen".
    <br>Lo and behold, ... [He laughs].
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>When the man of God just raised his hand, I was on the ground.
    <br>She Came For HEALING   But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>It felt like ten bags of cement, not one.
    <br>After that touch...
    <br>I used to be a drunkard.
    <br>I have been drinking for the past fifteen years.
    <br>No day would go by without me drinking.
    <br>I have also been smoking for the past four years.
    <br>My parents, my mother and my sister never knew that I used to smoke.
    <br>But on the 29th, last week Sunday, after that ten bags of cement touch ...
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>If I should see anyone drinking alcohol it irritates me.
    <br>If I walk on the street and see a young man smoking I will tell the person, "This thing is killing you".
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I have been delivered!
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Right now, people want to learn from your experience. What advice do you have for people?
    <br>My advice is for the youth and young men: Stay far from alcohol.
    <br>Stay close to God because He is the Author and the Finisher of our faith.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>She Came For HEALING But Then THIS HAPPENED!!!
    <br>Amen. We give thanks to God for this amazing miracle in your family.
    <br>And we want to encourage you that now that you have been healed and delivered through Christ's Word,
    <br>you should be ruled by that Word and make that Word the standard for your life
    <br>to make this miracle, this healing, this deliverance permanent, in Jesus' name.
