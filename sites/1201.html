  <p>    
    <br>Right now, this is the time now to strengthen your relationship with Jesus.
    <br>You have listened to the message today; that message is for you and for me.
    <br>In the Church we have two Christs:
    <br>The Christ of history and story and song - the baby Jesus.
    <br>Then, there is this Christ which the Holy Spirit reveals to us.
    <br>Which one are you following?
    <br>You cannot know Jesus without the help of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Worshipping Jesus without the help of the Holy Ghost is worshipping a god you do not know.
    <br>You can read your New Testament over and over and still never find Jesus in it.
    <br>You can be convinced that He is the Son of God and still not find Jesus.
    <br>You can know about Jesus Christ dying for you and still never know Jesus.
    <br>You can be a publisher of the Bible and still never know Jesus.
    <br>Where is Jesus? Jesus is in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.
    <br>Again.
    <br>If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.
    <br>Again.
    <br>If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.
    <br>Take your pen and write it down.
    <br>If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.
    <br>Because you don't know Jesus that is why you can run to spiritualists.
    <br>You can run to this. You can run to spiritualists.
    <br>You can run to that. You keep running.
    <br>Because you have not learnt to worship one Man.
    <br>If you have learnt to worship one Man, you will not worship other men.
    <br>I love the Man of Galilee
    <br>For He has done so very much for me
    <br>He has forgiven me all my sins
    <br>And sent the Holy Ghost to me
    <br>I love that Man of Galilee
    <br>The most dangerous one is that if you are not filled with the Spirit of God,
    <br>you cannot obey the written Word.
    <br>So then, what is your business with the Bible?
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The most dangerous - if you are not filled with the Spirit of God,
    <br>there is no way you can obey the written Word!
    <br>If you cannot obey the written Word, you quench Him.
    <br>So what is your business with the Bible then, when you are not filled with the Spirit,
    <br>when you are carrying it, carrying it to cause confusions all over.
    <br>You say, "This one is not good. That religion is not good. that one is not good".
    <br>That is the confusion we are having all over the world today.
    <br>Accusing this, accusing that, other religion, shouting this and that.
    <br>Is that what we are taught?
    <br>If you are not filled with the Spirit of God, you cannot obey this Bible.
    <br>And if you cannot obey this Bible, you quench Him.
    <br>So what is your business with the Bible?
    <br>"I am Christian" - you see everyone with the Bible.
    <br>Everyone with the Cross, big big Bible.
    <br>There is no Bible now - it is laptop everyone is having.
    <br>The Bible they are supposed to carry is inside the laptop.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If you are not filled with the Spirit of God, you cannot obey the written Word.
    <br>And if you cannot obey the written Word, you quench Him.
    <br>If your faith is to be a New Testament, if Jesus is to be the Christ of God
    <br>rather than the Christ of history and stories, then the illumination of the Holy Spirit
    <br>will tell your heart that you are worshipping Him, learning at His feet.
    <br>Right now, the business of today: Talk to yourself in your heart; keep your heart busy.
    <br>Begin to meditate right now. Meditate in His Word.
    <br>Hymn in your heart, spiritual song - keep your heart busy with songs of praise.
    <br>I will praise Him
    <br>I will praise Him forevermore
    <br>Keep your heart busy with this.
    <br>Soon, you will be filled.
    <br>I will praise Him
    <br>Keep your heart busy.
    <br>Forevermore
    <br>In my situation I will praise Him
    <br>I will praise Him forevermore
    <br>In my affliction I will praise Him
    <br>I will praise Him forevermore
    <br>Your affliction is not to kill you.
    <br>It is not to kill you but to strengthen your desire and determination for God.
    <br>That's all. That is the purpose of that.
    <br>Once you start praising Him, your affliction is not to kill you
    <br>but to strengthen your desire and determination for God.
    <br>In my situation I will praise Him
    <br>I will praise Him forevermore
    <br>So, keep your heart busy with this all the time.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>A break in faith is a break in prayer and a break in prayer is a break with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>A break in faith is a break in prayer and a break in prayer is a break with God.
    <br>When you have a break in your heart, when you stop meditating or praising God, satan comes.
    <br>Your heart - continue right now.
    <br>Are you doing that now in your heart?
    <br>"I will praise Him" - when you are eating...
    <br>Soon, you will be filled with the Spirit.
    <br>That is how to invite the Spirit of God.
    <br>Our heart is in a strong conflict - there is a conflict between the flesh and spirit.
    <br>"Go - don't go; come - don't come." - that is what is going on in our hearts.
    <br>Our heart is busy. There is a conflict.
    <br>There is a division in our hearts.
    <br>When this is out, the Landlord will take over.
    <br>Jesus is not a tenant; He is the Landlord. He is the owner of your heart.
    <br>But your heart is divided now: There is for and against in your heart.
    <br>When this is cleared, then you invite the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Our heart is the contact point, the communication point.
    <br>So start with this.
    <br>I will praise Him
    <br>Continue this in your heart.
    <br>By the time you continue this, it is not for you to choose the prayer to offer.
    <br>The heart will switch into prayer, switch into speaking in tongues.
    <br>You just hear a prayer in your heart.
    <br>It's not just for you to choose a prayer; just praise Him.
    <br>We are created to praise God.
    <br>You are created to praise God, your heart to praise God.
    <br>Your heart.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>This is the prayer for you now.
    <br>The prayer you have been offering, "Jesus do this for me, Jesus...",
    <br>an hour of prayer - that cannot work for you because you are not strong
    <br>You are a baby when it come to things of the Spirit.
    <br>You need to build your foundation first.
    <br>Your foundation is to keep your heart busy with praising.
    <br>You are still crawling. You are a baby, just a baby.
    <br>You cannot offer prayer here now because whom are you praying to?
    <br>- To a god you do not know.
    <br>Do you know God? - You don't know God and you are praying.
    <br>How can you pray to a god you do not know?
    <br>Until you know God before you pray.
    <br>If you don't know your Father, can you ask your Father things?
    <br>You need to know your Father before you pray, before you ask your Father.
    <br>But yet now, you don't know your Father because there is no Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You need to know God before prayer.
    <br>But if you don't know God and you are praying, whom are you praying to?
    <br>Foundation first - get your heart to your side.
    <br>Your heart is not on your side. It's like your heart is somewhere
    <br>When you are looking at me, your heart will say, "Hm, can T.B. Joshua do it?
    <br>Hm, look at what is happening. Oh, time is going.
    <br>This man should finish quickly. Someone is waiting for me".
    <br>Your heart keeps jumping, jumping. Your heart is not on your side.
    <br>Until you get your heart to your side, then the Holy Spirit comes in.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Get your heart to your side.
    <br>So now your heart:
    <br>I will praise Him
    <br>I will praise Him forevermore
    <br>Let this one keep running in your heart all the time, all day long.
    <br>Even when you are sleeping, till you sleep off.
    <br>This is why we give you faith bracelets to help on the outside.
    <br>Build the foundation before prayer. Know your Father before prayer.
    <br>You don't know God and you are praying to God.
    <br>How can you pray to a god you do not know? If you know Him, He will answer you.
    <br>But this time you pray - no answer because you don't know Him.
    <br>Someone keeps telling you, "This is your God, Jesus is your God".
    <br>But you are trying to know God in what way? - Without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>When you know your God, He will tell you, "Pray this time, meet me this time, appointment this time".
    <br>God relates to all like a father.
    <br>Like I am talking now - if I hear, "It's alright", I will just say the grace and leave from here.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You need to know God before prayer.
    <br>If you don't know God, whom are you praying to?
    <br>This is the time for foundation. Get your heart to your side; the Holy Spirit will come in.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. This is a special grace.
    <br>The Word given to you today - be a hearer, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, open your lips and confess whom you are now.
    <br>I am what God says I am!
    <br>I can do what God says I can do!
    <br>I have what God says I have!
    <br>Confess it - that is the platform now.
    <br>I am what God says I am!
    <br>I can do what God says I can do!
    <br>I am what God says I am!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Can someone tell me, "What is your problem now?" You should be able to tell me.
    <br>All these challenges, sickness - sickness is not a problem,
    <br>setback is not a problem, stagnation is not a problem.
    <br>The problem is: We don't know God we are praying to.
    <br>If you know me, you talk to me and I will answer you.
    <br>If I cannot tell you, I will tell you, "Hold on".
    <br>But this is absent. When we pray, we don't hear from God.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, do it for me!" - why can't you wait and let God reply?
    <br>We pray and say, "Amen".
    <br>It is two sides - you talk, God talks.
    <br>That is God - real God.
    <br>God talks.
    <br>If you are my father, "How are you, sir?"
    <br>"I am doing fine."
    <br>- "How are doing?"
    <br>- "I'm doing okay."
    <br>That is God.
    <br>But in this case today, we are the only person that is talking.
    <br>We never hear from Father, Jesus.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Make us a channel of faithfulness, a channel of shining light.
    <br>Make us Your channel of love.
    <br>Make us Your channel of pardon.
    <br>Make us Your channel of forgiveness where there is sin.
    <br>Make us Your channel of faithfulness, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>You are a channel of God. As you are going now, anywhere you are, you are a channel.
    <br>He has no mouth but your mouth to talk.
    <br>He has no hands but your hands.
    <br>He has no feet but your feet.
    <br>I am a channel of God - channel of love, pardon, forgiveness, faithfulness, obedience.
    <br>In Jesus' name. Amen!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Amen!
