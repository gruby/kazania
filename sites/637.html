    <br>This is your time, right now be ready.
    <br>If there is any area of your life the Lord has not touched,
    <br>our Lord Jesus Christ is concerned about you.
    <br>He loves you just like any of His apostles.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Right now, bow down your head and give thanks to Him.
    <br>You have seen the name Jesus working in the spirit.
    <br>You have seen the anointing of God working in the spirit.
    <br>The power of God working in the Spirit.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>What a God we serve, what a Son we have.
    <br>Father, thank You. Holy Spirit, thank You.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I can't hear you.
