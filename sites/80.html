    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Wiseman Racine moves with the force and power of God,
    <br>as he touches the people and they begin to manifest,
    <br>for satan has no hiding place in the presence of the power of God.
    <br>At the name of Jesus Christ, demons will tremble and flee,
    <br>for authority and power come when we are not standing in our own name
    <br>but in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The power of God challenges and pulls down the kingdom of satan
    <br>in the lives of the people, as they are being disconnected from the chains satan has used
    <br>to bind them to himself.
    <br>Remember, when the power of God is present, deliverance is like breathing.
    <br>As the Wiseman moves among the congregation,
    <br>he encounters this young man, who at the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the evil spirit within him begins to speak out.
    <br>Let's watch to see how he was delivered.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Speak louder!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am lust.
    <br>Speak!
    <br>I am the spirit of stealing, killing and destroying.
    <br>What have you done to his life, to his career?
    <br>I have destroyed him.
    <br>How did you destroy him?
    <br>I did not allow him to finish high school.
    <br>He earns money and then loses it.
    <br>He spends it on drugs.
    <br>He destroyed his family.
    <br>He made his family cry and hurt them.
    <br>What have you done to the family?
    <br>I destroyed them. I stole, hurt them and made them cry.
    <br>What of his career?
    <br>He can never get anything going.
    <br>Every time he got a job, he got fired.
    <br>He got caught doing something - stealing or coming to work high.
    <br>For how long have you been tormenting him?
    <br>Six years.
    <br>What are the other things that you evil spirit used to do?
    <br>Steal. I can remember credit card numbers and would be able to steal all the money they had.
    <br>What have you done to the parents?
    <br>I made them suffer.
    <br>They are pastors and I got caught with drugs in the church.
    <br>What have you done to the mother?
    <br>The mother - when they tied me up from being really high, I hit her.
    <br>I had no control.
    <br>Why do you want to destroy him?
    <br>I just want to kill everybody that hurt me and I want to destroy everybody.
    <br>What else have you done to him?
    <br>Every time he gets money or a career going, something happens -
    <br>he gets fired or loses the job.
    <br>He can't finish anything.
    <br>Everything he starts, he fails.
    <br>I took everything from him.
    <br>What have you done to his freedom?
    <br>He has no freedom.
    <br>Every night he is tortured.
    <br>He wakes up at night screaming.
    <br>He can't go to sleep sometimes.
    <br>Two or three hours of sleep every night.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ - come out!
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>Out, you demon!
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>Out - in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>Out - in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- I am good. Thank you.
    <br>- Do you remember what you have said?
    <br>- No.
    <br>That evil spirit that was destroying your life, career, destiny and family, bringing hurt -
    <br>Jesus has cast it out.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>- You are free.
    <br>- Follow Jesus.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is David Parkhotyuk.
    <br>I am from USA, Washington State.
    <br>In my life, I was always rebellious against my father.
    <br>I would never listen to anything he said.
    <br>At a young age, I got introduced by my cousin to smoking marijuana
    <br>and then, I became a drug addict.
    <br>Everything I ever did was smoking weed and marijuana.
    <br>I was motivated by the spirit of stealing, killing and destroying.
    <br>That spirit led me to leave my family and run away from my house.
    <br>I ran to join a drug house
    <br>where people like me, who had the same spirit of stealing, killing and destroying, lived.
    <br>They introduced me to harder drugs.
    <br>They introduced me to crystal meth, pills and cocaine.
    <br>I would be doing it and would run mental.
    <br>I wouldn't know what I was doing or where I was.
    <br>I called my mum and dad and told them, "Mum, dad, I am getting high;
    <br>I am smoking and doing drugs," just to hurt them.
    <br>The spirit would lead me to hurt and destroy them as much as I possibly could.
    <br>One day, I called them and they invited me to come home.
    <br>After I came home, my father and I got into a big fight.
    <br>After we got into a big fight, he told me that I had to leave the house
    <br>because of what I was doing.
    <br>Then, I started fighting him and he tied me up.
    <br>After he tied me up, I started fighting even more.
    <br>I tried to fight it. The whole family came together to try to stop me.
    <br>I was trying to kill them.
    <br>Everything in my power, I was trying to destroy and kill them.
    <br>Thank God that they tied me up and restrained me
    <br>because if it wasn't for them restraining me, I would have killed them and destroyed them.
    <br>After that, the police came and handcuffed me.
    <br>They took me to a hospital where they drug tested me
    <br>and found that I had drugs in my system, that I had crystal meth in my system.
    <br>I didn't sleep for days.
    <br>After that, they took me to prison.
    <br>Prison was something I was already well-known to.
    <br>I had been in prison three times.
    <br>Every time I went to prison, I would meet the wrong people.
    <br>I would meet people who were rapists, murderers, armed robbers and drug lords.
    <br>I even wanted to be a drug dealer,
    <br>selling illegal drugs to people but by the grace of God, I didn't go that far.
    <br>After I got out of jail, I wanted to hurt my family,
    <br>I wanted to destroy them as much as I could.
    <br>After that, I came out.
    <br>I still continued living my bad life and wanting more.
    <br>In that jail, I got possessed with more evil powers.
    <br>I wanted to steal, kill even more and then, I went to jail for my last time.
    <br>The last time I went to jail was worse because I had a spirit telling me that I needed to steal a car.
    <br>So, I went and stole a car.
    <br>After that, I got home and told my parents that the car belonged to my friend.
    <br>That same night, the spirit told me that I should go and steal more cars
    <br>because I felt I had strength and power to steal more cars.
    <br>That same night, I went to an auto store where they sold and fixed cars.
    <br>I went and waited until everyone was gone and there was no security,
    <br>there was no lock on the gate.
    <br>I ran and broke through the window.
    <br>I came inside the auto store.
    <br>I stole really expensive tools, up to $15,000 worth of tools.
    <br>After that, I stole a BMW and loaded all the tools from the shop into the car.
    <br>I drove off, thinking I was going to get away but later that night,
    <br>the police caught me and took me to jail.
    <br>After they took me to jail, the judge told me that for Auto Second and
    <br>Burglary Second, I was facing 15 years in prison
    <br>and I could have got the maximum penalty.
    <br>But by the grace of God, I only got two months out of the 15 years
    <br>that I could have spent in there.
    <br>After I spent two months there, I came out and
    <br>my parents told me that I needed to go to The SCOAN, to get saved and delivered
    <br>because there was nothing that they could do to help me;
    <br>nothing that they could even do to help me out of the situation I was in.
    <br>On my way to The SCOAN, Lagos, at the airport I encountered more trouble.
    <br>I ran away from the airport to get high and do more drugs
    <br>because the spirit in me was longing for drugs; it wanted more inside of me.
    <br>So, I took drugs and pills.
    <br>I don't know how I got back to the airport.
    <br>I don't even know when or how I arrived in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Arriving in Nigeria, my criminal acts were still there.
    <br>I still wanted to find drugs, I was running around, up and down,
    <br>just trying to find places where I could find drugs
    <br>and there was nowhere I could find drugs.
    <br>Then during the Sunday service, they pushed me to the prayer line.
    <br>I thought this was just another prayer, just another place.
    <br>My father took me to many places in America to get prayed for and nothing worked.
    <br>Many pastors and preachers prayed for me but nothing worked.
    <br>But when Wiseman Racine came and touched me,
    <br>it was as if something locked inside of me.
    <br>I had no control.
    <br>A voice was speaking through me and I didn't know what voice was speaking.
    <br>I had no control on myself.
    <br>It was as if a man was speaking through me and I couldn't do anything to stop him.
    <br>After that, I found myself on the ground.
    <br>I woke up and felt free.
    <br>I felt as if I was a new person;
    <br>I felt light and I felt something had escaped from inside of me.
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>After the deliverance, I feel free and I thank the man of God for delivering me.
    <br>I thank the man of God for everything that he has done for me.
    <br>A million thanks cannot express the thanks that I have for you.
    <br>I was on the verge of dying, I was on the verge of giving up
    <br>and committing suicide because I did not want to live anymore.
    <br>The spirit kept on tormenting me and destroying me.
    <br>Everything I ever tried in life failed.
    <br>Everything I ever tried to do failed in life.
    <br>I thank God for this deliverance.
    <br>After this deliverance, it was as if something that was inside of me left me.
    <br>Something that was torturing me and tormenting me left me.
    <br>I thank God for that.
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, I don't know what I can do to repay God for what I have done
    <br>or for giving me the grace to be saved and delivered.
    <br>Father, I need to ask you, tell me what I can do to repay God for what He has done for me.
    <br>Many people in the USA go through the same trouble that I went through -
    <br>the same things, the same problems that I went through.
    <br>I know people in the USA are controlled by drugs and drugs destroy them the most.
    <br>If I can travel to and around the USA to rehabilitation and reformation centres,
    <br>I can share my testimony of how God has changed my life and set me free
    <br>from this disease and bondage that I was in.
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>After my deliverance, I feel amazing, sir.
    <br>I need to spread the word about this church and what God is doing in this place.
    <br>This place is a real church and there is real power in this church,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>My advice to the whole world and for people in the USA,
    <br>the people that are running around with guns, killing innocent people, children need deliverance.
    <br>People who are doing drugs need deliverance.
    <br>For a person to go grab a gun and kill innocent children and people, it not normal.
    <br>They are possessed by the same evil spirits that I was possessed with.
    <br>They need to find a living church where they can go to get delivered
    <br>and set free by a real man of God.
    <br>"I Tried To KILL My Own Family..." | Drug Addicts DELIVERANCE!!!
    <br>I can't express the thanks and love that I have for you, sir, for what you have done.
    <br>I thank you so much for everything that you have done, sir.
    <br>I do not deserve to be alive.
    <br>Sir, I deserve to be dead.
    <br>For what I have done in my life, I don't deserve anything.
    <br>I thank you for doing everything you could for delivering and setting me free.
    <br>Father, I thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>He has been delivered for the past two months now.
    <br>We decided to leave him after the deliverance.
    <br>You know, in this trouble, initiation into drugs,
    <br>after the deliverance you need to give time to see,
    <br>because he also needs to build character.
    <br>For the past three months, after he has been delivered...
    <br>The first week this guy arrived here, the whole of Ikotun Egbe knew someone was in The Synagogue.
    <br>He doesn't walk - he runs.
    <br>He would be running like this.
    <br>In the supermarket, if he could not find Indian hemp or drugs, he stared drinking anything.
    <br>The water turned to a drug.
    <br>When he finished with drinks, he would come to the altar here and carry...
    <br>Imagine someone carrying a water melon.
    <br>He carried it and began to eat it.
    <br>He wanted his mouth to be busy.
    <br>For one week, we had to be arranging him for deliverance.
    <br>After the deliverance, for the past three months now - wow.
    <br>I think he has said it all.
    <br>This is exactly what is happening all over the world.
    <br>Our young ones, the youth, the leaders of tomorrow, they are in trouble.
    <br>Look - he is free.
    <br>He has said it all.
    <br>That is his joy - his ministry is to go into those reformation centres
    <br>and talk to them and educate them.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Congratulations to you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
