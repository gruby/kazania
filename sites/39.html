  <p>    
    <br>My name is Ezekiel Ayodeji, I'm a widower.
    <br>I am a member of The Blood of Divine Church, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I have three children.
    <br>On the 5th of June my wife died; after her death, I was at home.
    <br>One week later, my shop, where I sell electrical parts got burnt.
    <br>The Governor came there and promised to help me.
    <br>I appreciated what the Governor did for me.
    <br>But after that I did not see any help again.
    <br>My children were sent out of school.
    <br>I am suffering; I don’t have food to eat.
    <br>I am physically challenged.
    <br>I watched Emmanuel TV and saw how our father in the Lord (Prophet T.B. Joshua) helped people like me.
    <br>These are your children?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I am physically challenged.
    <br>I have a leg problem.
    <br>OK, you are the father of these 3 children?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>These children are going to school?
    <br>They have been sent out of school; they are not going to school any more.
    <br>They are no more going to school?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When this problem arose, my landlord gave me a quit notice.
    <br>I never packed, I promised him I would give him the money.
    <br>I beg the man of God to help me because all my children are my future tomorrow.
    <br>I want him to help me to send them to school.
    <br>You have listened to that; there are many people like this in your community.
    <br>These are the people that make your money useless
    <br>because it has meaning when you spend it on these people.
    <br>But without spending it on them, it becomes opposite.
    <br>Money becomes a curse when we are not spending it on the needy.
    <br>We see what we can do for the scholarship.
    <br>Give the father N300,000 to get something doing first.
    <br>Thank God, my Lord.
    <br>We can now talk about how these children will go back to school.
    <br>We support you.
    <br>We will continue that support.
    <br>And the house you are living in - we are interested to see what we can do to get you...
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>You listened to Mr Ezekiel Ayodeji.
    <br>Give them bags of rice.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>As we are here now, I am expecting people to begin to think of
    <br>how you can get him a car, an automatic vehicle which he can be using.
    <br>I will expect somebody here to do that.
    <br>He is disabled, but he can walk.
    <br>There is a vehicle this man can use.
    <br>Get him a car and with all this financial support...
    <br>Look at thousands of people all over the world, "How much is a car?"
    <br>Get him a car and see whether you will not receive millions of joy.
    <br>We are all listening; get this man a car.
    <br>If he doesn't know how to drive, they will train him in 2-3 months - automatic car, just hands.
    <br>You will make his life better.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>The following Sunday, Mr. Ezekiel Ayodeji came back to give his testimony.
    <br>My name is Ezekiel Ayodeji.
    <br>I am a member of The Blood Of Divine Church, Akure.
    <br>My age is 45 years.
    <br>I am always watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I know how he (T.B. Joshua) helps the physically challenged like me.
    <br>Because of that, I came to this place for help.
    <br>When I got to this place, I explained to them the story of what happened to me
    <br>and the man of God gave me the sum of N300,000 and six bags of rice.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>After the man of God gave me the money, I went back to my state (Akure).
    <br>The first thing I did is that I went to my church to pay the tithes.
    <br>That is the sum of N30,000 to my pastor.
    <br>All the debts that I owed, I paid them.
    <br>The money remaining was N200,000 plus.
    <br>When I went to sleep, I thought that if I kept this money in my hand, I would just waste it.
    <br>Since this incident happened, I had promised in my heart that if I got a plot of land, I would buy it.
    <br>So, that money gave me the opportunity to buy one plot of land.
    <br>That is the sum of N150,000 for the plot of land.
    <br>So, I am here to thank God for what the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua has done for me.
    <br>I appreciate it.
    <br>How much money remains now?
    <br>The remaining money is N50,000.
    <br>With how many children?
    <br>Three children.
    <br>Me, I a bit disagree with the pastor that collected the N30,000.
    <br>I’m going to return that N30,000 back to you now.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Because there are many areas you can render your services to the ministry,
    <br>but financially you are not strong.
    <br>What are you doing in that church?
    <br>I was an usher, but as time went on they appointed me as the technical director there.
    <br>That kind of area you are rendering is the area you are strong in,
    <br>because you are not strong financially; it is poverty that chased you to this place.
    <br>So, I think my honourable man of God; I think there are areas he can pay the tithes.
    <br>He is not strong financially.
    <br>He will still pay tithes, but not now.
    <br>He should invest the money and start doing something.
    <br>When he starts doing something, he will begin to pay tithes out of those things.
    <br>Not suddenly huge money - bam.
    <br>I will return the tithe of N30,000 back to you.
    <br>I’ve given the other N30,000 for his ministry.
    <br>They should not return it back.
    <br>It’s for the ministry, it’s for God’s work.
    <br>We are going to present you a car.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You should serve God in that church.
    <br>It is a good church.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Help me to greet the man of God there.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Give him back the tithe he paid to the church.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>Thank God.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>That is the tithe he paid to the church.
    <br>When you get back, tell the man that you bought the land from that T.B. Joshua says,
    <br>he should please return your money; you don't need land.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>We were expecting you to say, "I reserved some money for feeding".
    <br>You said you bought land.
    <br>And the best is yet to come.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>Let's see the car.
    <br>This is the new car given to Mr Ezekiel Ayodeji by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank God!
    <br>Look at the amazed expression on his face, as he hears the promise of a new car from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is obviously a great surprise to Mr Ezekiel.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>The man that brought the car is here.
    <br>Let's welcome the man please.
    <br>This is the man that brought the car for you.
    <br>This is the man that donated the car to Mr Ezekiel on hearing his plight last week Sunday.
    <br>He steps forward, presents him with the car keys and the legal documents,
    <br>thus making Mr Ezekiel Ayodeji the official owner of this new car.
    <br>This is what you call giving.
    <br>Give the less privileged.
    <br>This is the right giving, because he needs it.
    <br>He really needs it.
    <br>He has now become a car owner.
    <br>Mr Ezekiel Ayodeji holds up the keys to his new car and the cash gift of N30,000 from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>Mr Ayodeji and his children are there outside the church auditorium to see their new car.
    <br>He climbs into the car with joy and gives thanks to God.
    <br>TOUCHING: Why TB Joshua Returned This Man's TITHES!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I didn't expect this thing at all.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>I'm the proud owner of the car. Thank God!
    <br>To God be the glory.
