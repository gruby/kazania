    <br>God Is Still Saying Something
    <br>On the 29th of December 2013, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied a coming challenge in the aviation industry
    <br>that would negatively affect both passengers and airlines.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>Those of us who are into the business of
    <br>airlines, aeroplanes, flying or whatever,
    <br>you will be at the airport for two or three days and you may not get a flight to go to where you are going
    <br>because the demand will be more than supply.
    <br>There will be a shortage of flying -
    <br>airlines, airplane shortage.
    <br>It will be so difficult.
    <br>The business will not be as usual.
    <br>Most especially in Africa.
    <br>It will affect Africa so much - 
    <br>the African Continent, most especially.
    <br>If your business is about flying from one country to another,
    <br>I think there will be a challenge.
