    <br>Get ready for life after the sickness lockdown:
    <br>A word From T. B. Joshua!
    <br>If you don't get your job back, or you don't get a proper job or a full-time job,
    <br>or you run into loss or lose a loved one after this lockdown,
    <br>don't despair; don't doubt your Guard.
    <br>God is about to establish you.
    <br>Ask any successful man or woman and they will tell you about how much disappointment
    <br>and setback they had to endure to come to a new level in life.
    <br>For many, it was a sack letter, an accusation, a petition against them, and they lost their job,
    <br>but today they are established.
    <br>I want to believe the similar signs I am seeing now will happen to many
    <br>while others may lose loved ones or run into loss.
    <br>I can see beyond many of our situations at hand.
    <br>That is why I am telling you that behind that situation lies your future.
    <br>After the lockdown, whatever disappointment you will receive
    <br>or whatever happens - think deeply and you will see the reason why this is happening to you.
    <br>Remember, many successful people today once had the same experience
    <br>and they were moved to a higher level in life thereby.
    <br>Ordinarily, you would not want to leave your position or status
    <br>and say you want to establish yourself without a situation like this.
    <br>Something must happen - and that seems to be happening now.
    <br>Sometimes God allows situations like this - I mean, disappointment or something more serious -
    <br>so that you can take your proper position and possessions.
    <br>Sometimes it is to enable you to get to where you belong.
    <br>I know where I belong!
    <br>What is your dark moment?
    <br>It may be to make you see clearly where you belong, I mean, to prepare you for your future.
    <br>I know where I belong!
    <br>It is time to know where you belong; that is why all this is happening now.
    <br>Don't forget everything big starts little.
    <br>If something big starts big, it calls for concern.
    <br>Starting little with a sincere heart is evidence that you will grow.
    <br>Everything genuine likes to start little.
    <br>You have to be ready to start little,
    <br>cut your coat according to your cloth and endure temporary pain.
    <br>You know what I mean: the type of life you live must be in accordance with little.
    <br>It may cause you to withdraw from the city to a rural life or to do away with some of your properties.
    <br>You will have them back at the right time but let them go now for preparation to grow.
    <br>Many things you have now may not be necessary for the journey,
    <br>may not be relevant to the situation that is coming.
    <br>Let them go and believe this word you are hearing.
    <br>It is a word from God.
    <br>Ask your family members to cut their coats according to their cloth.
    <br>If any of them was living big before,
    <br>they have to prepare to adjust now to the situation that is coming.
    <br>Check your store and bring out the things you may need to sell.
    <br>Right now, you need to be living modestly.
    <br>Women that married men because of affluence or men that married women because of affluence:
    <br>divorce should not be the order of the day.
    <br>We just need to adjust.
    <br>You may likely need some new friends because not all of your friends will be able to cope and adjust.
    <br>The future is still there, but only calls for adjustment.
    <br>Get ready for life after the sickness lockdown: A word From T.B. Joshua!
    <br>Many things we are seeing now will go and many new things will come.
    <br>If you know you've got anything by injustice, such will not be able to stand.
    <br>Whatever you might have received by injustice will go.
    <br>It is only our genuine sweat that will see us through while nature is ready to take its course.
    <br>God just started this judgment somewhere.
    <br>It will soon get to me; it will soon get to you.
    <br>Let us be ready.
    <br>All that I am saying does not mean you are down but this is just what has come in our own time.
    <br>Every age has its own challenges.
    <br>People of yesterday had their own challenges in a different way;
    <br>others have gone through so-called challenges in their own way.
    <br>Today those who adjust will be able to overcome
    <br>and those who are unable to adjust will go by the level of their challenges -
    <br>down, fall, death.
    <br>Something must happen every 100 years to affect the whole world.
    <br>This is what has happened in our own lifetime.
    <br>It has been like that for generations.
    <br>Those who respond to the demands of the age will end up as overcomers, victors, winners.
    <br>However, those who fail to respond appropriately will eventually go down with the times,
    <br>either by disappointment, failure, death.
    <br>It is unchangeable. It must happen.
    <br>The nature of the challenge may be different.
    <br>Irrespective of how it happened, the nation that caused it, the person that caused it, it had to happen.
    <br>Something just had to cause it.
    <br>Get ready for life after the sickness lockdown: A word From T.B. Joshua!
    <br>By the ending of June to the first week of July, this will begin to become a point of reference:
    <br>"This man said this; that man said it" - but it is God that said it.
    <br>Good Morning and Win Today!
    <br>Get ready for life after the sickness lockdown: A word From T.B. Joshua!
