  <p>    
    <br>Let's hear the viewpoint of the SABC - South Africa's national broadcast channel -
    <br>on the incident that happened at The SCOAN on September 12, 2014.
    <br>More viewpoints from the international media will follow.
    <br>HOW THE SCOAN BUILDING WAS DESTROYED!!! | Shocking Media Report (SABC)
    <br>This is Newsroom. From Johannesburg here in South Africa, my name is Eben Jansen.
    <br>This show is always live.
    <br>This week, the International Journal of Scientific Engineering and Research
    <br>questioned the verdict of a Lagos State Coroner's Court ruling. 
    <br>In an edition titled, "The Elimination of Structural Failure and the Placement of Chemical Explosives...",
    <br>weapons expert Paul Iguniwei says the collapse was caused by an infrasonic weapon.
    <br>Iguniwei, who is a lecturer at the Kaduna Polytechnic College of Science and Technology,
    <br>argued that the only viable scientific option to explain the unique nature of the controversial collapse
    <br>was an infrasonic weapon.
    <br>Now, Paul Iguniwei joins us from Benin City in the south of Nigeria via Skype to quickly give us his views.
    <br>Good morning to you Paul; thank you for joining us.
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>Just tell us the evidence that made you come to the conclusion that you did. What was that?
    <br>Basically, why I came to that conclusion was the fact that when I looked at the whole scenario,
    <br>the accepted signatures we look out for after an explosion - those signatures were not found at the site.
    <br>The government's position has been that the building collapse was due to poor engineering development.
    <br>That option - when we looked at it critically we discovered that the way the building came down
    <br>is not consistent with a structure of poor materials.
    <br>On inspection of the foundations, we discovered that the foundation was as if it snapped off.
    <br>There was no crack, there was no stress.
    <br>Then consequently, Lagos State Materials Laboratory stated a result that showed to a high level
    <br>that the material structure and the materials used in the construction were in order.
    <br>So, it generated a lot of controversy in Nigeria.
    <br>I have been a scientist with an interest in such occurrences.
    <br>I took a personal interest and I looked at the site.
    <br>That led to my conclusions.
    <br>There was this low flying aircraft that flew over the building several times.
    <br>When it flew for the last time, after 30 minutes the building came down.
    <br>After extensive research, I came to the the conclusion that that plane was carrying an infrasonic weapon
    <br>in the form of an infrasonic generator and it fired repeatedly over the building.
    <br>Once the building, at the atomic level, absorbed such energy - this high level of energy can cause
    <br>such a uniform crumbling collapse.
    <br>It is very important that we understand how the building came down.
    <br>That led to the evidence that I gave at the Coroner's Court.
    <br>I decided to go further by testing my principles in an international journal, outside Africa.
    <br>To my delight, it was accepted and published.
    <br>Paul, I want to ask you - you're a man of science, a man who deals with evidence
    <br>and international benchmarks as you just mentioned - I want to ask you:
    <br>In this case, what international benchmarks did you look at for the use
    <br>of this weapon when you did your research?
    <br>I am asking specifically, do you have any video or photographic evidence of an infrasonic weapon
    <br>being used anywhere else in the world, in your research, to prove that this could be possible?
    <br>When I did my research, apart from the fact that the Americans and Russians
    <br>had looked deeply into infrasonic weapons research, the closest we have is that of
    <br>a Russian sonic weapon which you can find on the internet.
    <br>Don't forget, it is not a weapon that anybody can get their hands on it.
    <br>So far, the one we have is on the internet - you can find it in one of my citations -
    <br>having a parabolic antenna which has the capability of firing sonic force, which is a form of infrasonic weapon.
    <br>As we may know, what comes to the limelight, or to people's knowledge in the news media,
    <br>is almost nothing, incomparable to the things we don't know about.
    <br>A lot of research has been going on.
    <br>Currently they have no smart weapons or drones that can target individuals.
    <br>You don't see that on the news but it is being done -
    <br>we know from the body language of these nations and the tests they are carrying out.
    <br>So, based on that, I personally have not handled an infrasonic weapon.
    <br>Only a few nations have that capability.
    <br>But different forms of this energy have been used in the past; it has been used in crowd control in Ireland.
    <br>The French have also used it as an anti-riot control weapon.
    <br>The Russians have tested a variation of that and the Americans are also deeply funding such research.
    <br>So, based on that, that has happened since the Americans took a strong position in 1997 -
    <br>from then until now a lot of research has been going on and we do not know how deep,
    <br>if you have read my submission, this research has gone to.
    <br>For me, I believe that it exists and it is clandestine and therefore not in the public domain.
    <br>Thank you for joining us.
    <br>That is the man who wrote this report.
    <br>Here is South Africa, Bally Chuene and Kirsten Nematandani are with us this morning.
    <br>They are with an architect, a man with more than 50 years experience, Derrick Garvie.
    <br>They are in the studio with me this morning to talk about the latest scientific research into this.
    <br>Mr Nematandani, if I can start with you, just give us your overview of how you view the latest information.
    <br>Good morning to you and thank you for the opportunity.
    <br>Let me say, I was privileged to have been out there at The Synagogue and saw the collapsed building.
    <br>At the time we had Mr Ntonga, an engineer from Tanzania, who took us through
    <br>the structure itself, in particular the foundations.
    <br>I personally saw how intact that foundation was, nothing that shows any cracks,
    <br>showing that the structural failure issue should be ruled out.
    <br>It was a privilege to have been there with the families that were affected.
    <br>All of us came to a conclusion that it would appear that the reasons given by the Coroner
    <br>on the structural failure do not really qualify for the building,
    <br>in particular comparing it with various previous structural failures.
    <br>Because the way the building came down in a few seconds, and of course the dust, fits exactly...
    <br>I think we saw 10 or 11 examples of such, and that is why we feel this seems to be the solution.
    <br>Let me just correct two very important aspects that you missed there.
    <br>Firstly, Paul is not a 'Nigerian scientist'. He is a scientist by himself.
    <br>The article that he published is in the International Journal of Scientific Engineering and Research.
    <br>Secondly, what he is saying is not that the Americans or Russians caused the building to collapse,
    <br>but that technology has been used by these particular two countries.
    <br>Mr Garvie, you have more than 50 years experience.
    <br>Just tell us how you view the collapse itself and what has followed after.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>There is no question in my mind that it was a controlled demolition.
    <br>There are different ways to take down a building of that size.
    <br>51 years ago in Durban, I used to do it with a hammer and then sell all things they extracted from the building.
    <br>This was an implosion that was controlled, as was done with me in Durban 50 years ago.
    <br>There is no doubt about that.
    <br>When the building falls in on itself in a cloud of dust, it cannot be anything else.
    <br>It was an imploded controlled demolition.
    <br>There is absolutely no doubt about that.
    <br>Mr Nematandani, we have to look at where else in the world this kind of thing has happened
    <br>and which organisations would have this kind of advanced science that you mentioned
    <br>and that is looked at in this report.
    <br>Have you found any evidence of that around the world, either video or photographic?
    <br>What we have as certain is the fact that any controlled demolition will bring a structure down symmetrically
    <br>in a few seconds and there will always be the dust smoke that you see.
    <br>And it is similar; it looks like ash and that fits the description.
    <br>Of course, the researcher would give us more evidence, and as you can see,
    <br>the research article is actually approved by international board members.
    <br>The editorial board members come from the US, Russia, and all the major contributors are people
    <br>who spend their time in labs, who have evidence.
    <br>What more can you look for if your experts say that indeed they agree with the facts?
    <br>That is what we have.
    <br>Mr Nematandani, you have the floor to speak to South Africa and the rest of Africa on this channel
    <br>to give us your final views on this matter and how yourself and T.B. Joshua would like to close the book
    <br>on what was a very dark day for South Africa.
    <br>Once again we would like to say to the viewers out there, we have been very clear from the outset that
    <br>at some stage the truth will come out,
    <br>and this is the process towards the truth that we have been talking about.
    <br>Thank you for coming and being so frank with us today and for putting this forward to us.
    <br>That is Mr Bally Chuene sitting in the middle, Mr Kirsten Nematandani, and with them was
    <br>Mr Derrick Garvie who is an architect with more than 50 years experience here in South Africa.
