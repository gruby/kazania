  <p>    
    <br>Miss Danielle Kriel has come to The SCOAN from South Africa with the terrible problem of bipolar disorder.
    <br>At just 16 years old she has been tormented by this terrible problem for several years,
    <br>having to live in isolation and to be consistently watched due to her obsession with cutting her veins,
    <br>just to see blood.
    <br>The medical report clearly states the symptoms that have plagued Danielle's life,
    <br>as a result of the bipolar disorder; depression, suicidal thoughts, and self-harm.
    <br>The disturbing photographs by her side show Danielle's self-inflicted wounds in an attempt to commit suicide.
    <br>We can also see a "missing child" notice, showing how the bipolar disorder
    <br>had even caused this young teenager to run away from home.
    <br>There are demonic forces that cause people to be bowed down in bondage.
    <br>Now, in the arena of liberty, the demonic forces behind the bondage of this young girl are about to be exposed
    <br>and disconnected, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's listen to her.
    <br>My name is Danielle Kriel; I’m 16 years old, and I’m from South Africa.
    <br>Who is the person sitting next to you?
    <br>It’s my mum.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is mental disorder – bipolar disorder,
    <br>borderline personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and chronic depression.
    <br>I also have the problem of self-harm and suicidal tendencies.
    <br>For how many years have you had all these problems?
    <br>For nine years.
    <br>I can’t go to school.
    <br>I do home-schooling.
    <br>I also have panic attacks.
    <br>I can’t wear short sleeves because I have to hide the cuts and scars.
    <br>I would have anxiety and rage attacks in school.
    <br>So, that made it impossible for me to go to school and I had to have home-schooling.
    <br>Normally, I would just rush out of the classroom, go to the bathroom
    <br>and there, I would either cut myself or punch the walls or I would bite – anything to inflict pain.
    <br>It was always on yourself, not towards others?
    <br>No - it was always on myself but I felt the urge to do it to others; that is why I isolate myself -
    <br>not to do it on others.
    <br>Can you show us your arms and the scars you are talking about?
    <br>These are all the scars.
    <br>Some of them have faded.
    <br>There are a few like this one where I almost died – it was near fatal – these two.
    <br>It is only by the grace of God that I am still alive.
    <br>The multiple scars that criss-cross her arms tell their own story of pain and agony,
    <br>as the addiction to cutting herself and seeing blood has almost taken her life.
    <br>What is it that makes you start cutting and harming yourself?
    <br>Most of the time, it’s when emotionally, I am too overwhelmed and I can’t cope.
    <br>Then, I would get into a rage.
    <br>Also, when I feel the urge to hurt others, I will do it to myself instead before I would calm down
    <br>so that I would not hurt others.
    <br>It is satisfying to see the blood and even sometimes, I get the urge to drink the blood.
    <br>It is also satisfying and numbs every emotion.
    <br>It cuts everything off – I become like a total zombie and don’t have to face reality.
    <br>The first time, it lasted a long time and then, as I cut more and more, it lasted a shorter time
    <br>and I had to cut deeper to get the same effect.
    <br>So, when you were cutting yourself - how do you normally go about that?
    <br>Sometimes, I would do it on impulse.
    <br>I would just grab something and randomly slice wherever I can.
    <br>I used razor blades, glass and the blades of sharpeners.
    <br>Sometimes, it’s on impulse – I just grab something and do it;
    <br>at other times, I plan it for a long time and then do it.
    <br>Anytime this rage comes upon you and you don't have the opportunity to cut yourself,
    <br>how does this affect you; what else do you do?
    <br>Then, I start biting, scratching and eating walls.
    <br>Normally, when there is someone there, I will isolate myself and then do it
    <br>because I know I can’t make any noise.
    <br>I would just use anything I could find and if that was not enough, I would break a mirror.
    <br>I would use anything sharp I could find to cut and inflict pain.
    <br>Have you tried to stop these kind of things by yourself?
    <br>I can’t stop; it has gotten worse and worse.
    <br>I have to do it; I can’t stop.
    <br>You mentioned that you have had suicidal thoughts and tendencies.
    <br>Tell us - what were some of the close encounters you have had.
    <br>There has been quite a few.
    <br>The latest one was that I drank poison.
    <br>The one before that, I am not sure; it was amitraz – something to kill fleas and dogs.
    <br>I found it in the cupboard.
    <br>I prepared everything and wrote notes and took everything.
    <br>Just a while before that, I cut and I cut too deep.
    <br>I hit the artery and bled almost completely out.
    <br>The doctor said I had 30 millilitres of blood left in me.
    <br>So, it was only by the grace of God that He kept me alive, that I didn’t die in that incident.
    <br>Also, on numerous times, I have overdosed on pills – any pills I could find.
    <br>I have tried hanging myself and every time, it just failed.
    <br>It either has no effect on me or someone just comes and interrupts and stops it.
    <br>Every time, something just stops it.
    <br>Now, you are here at The SCOAN, what do you believe God Almighty will do for you?
    <br>I believe He will deliver me and set me free completely and then
    <br>I will have a relationship with Him and be able to help others in the same situation as me
    <br>who isn’t understood and I can help them through the grace of God.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We believe with you that God Almighty will heal you completely and set you free, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's hear a word from your mother.
    <br>I am Mrs Kriel, from South Africa and I am the mother of Danielle.
    <br>I must watch her 24/7, 365.
    <br>It is quite a job – to be a watcher, to hear any sounds,
    <br>all the knives and every sharp item, there is nothing there -
    <br>even stuff to clean the house, I lock it away.
    <br>My weapons, I lock them away in the safe.
    <br>My marriage – I nearly divorced my husband because it has an influence on our family life.
    <br>I myself have rage and I can’t take it anymore.
    <br>A friend suggested that we must come to The SCOAN and get deliverance from God.
    <br>How did you first discover this problem in the life of your daughter?
    <br>At the age of 12, the teacher phoned me.
    <br>She was doing home-schooling in a centrum and the teacher phoned me
    <br>that I should quickly come to the office.
    <br>I drove to her office and then she informed me that Danielle had cut herself.
    <br>From there on, I was watching her.
    <br>She would go from friend to friend watching Danielle
    <br>because I was the sole breadwinner at that stage.
    <br>After work, I would pick her up.
    <br>At one stage, she was staying with friends on a farm for 10 months and they would look after Danielle.
    <br>We took her to the institution, Denmar in South Africa but it was not successful
    <br>and the doctors stated that she was supposed to be in an institute for the rest of her life.
    <br>Now, you are here at The SCOAN, what do you believe God Almighty will do for your daughter?
    <br>He will deliver her completely.
    <br>Amen. We believe with you that God Almighty will deliver both you and your daughter,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Man of God, deliver me!
    <br>I’ve been struggling with self-harm and suicide.
    <br>Please, Man of God, have mercy on me!
    <br>I cut myself.
    <br>I have been doing this since 12.
    <br>Please, Man of God, deliver me!
    <br>We can't take it anymore. 
    <br>Please, God!
    <br>It’s spiritual attacks – evil spirits.
    <br>Stuff which happened to her as a child – she never told me.
    <br>Many times – more than 20, 30 – she is cutting her veins.
    <br>Man of God, please, help me!

    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Danielle Kriel, I'm 16 years old, I'm from South Africa, and this is my mum.
    <br>The problem that brought me here, to The SCOAN was:
    <br>I had cut myself since the age of 12 very badly, I attempted suicide numerous times,
    <br>and I was diagnosed with a lot of disorders -
    <br>bipolar disorder, border line personality disorder, and chronic depression.
    <br>It all started when I was about 6 years old.
    <br>I was sexually abused till the age of about 10, numerous times by numerous people.
    <br>Since the age of 8 I started biting and scratching and bruising - just lightly.
    <br>I wasn't sure what it did to me, it just made me feel better.
    <br>When I was 12 years old, I started cutting.
    <br>I was institutionalized for that and they told me that I would be in an institution for the rest of my life
    <br>and I would be on medications; that it was only manageable, not treatable.
    <br>Then, my suicidal attempts also started.
    <br>From then till now I have attempted suicides almost 120 - 150 times, and that's not even exaggerating.
    <br>We really fought it a lot and my parents couldn't really cope with this, so I was living with other families.
    <br>Every time my parents sent me away to other families, I would try not to mess up;
    <br>but then I would cut or attempt suicide, and they would send me back to my parents again.
    <br>When I messed up at my parents, they would send me back, so it was back and forth rejection the whole time.
    <br>The first time I attempted suicide - it was an overdose;
    <br>I overdosed on pills that I found in my mum's cupboard.
    <br>I have done it many times.
    <br>There were few near-death experiences as a result of that.
    <br>I have also taken poison and it made me sick but it didn't kill me.
    <br>I tried hanging myself.
    <br>At one point, when I was at my grandmother's house, I found a gun
    <br>and I thought that I could end it finally but then the grace of God stepped in:
    <br>As I held it in my hand, I just couldn't pull the trigger.
    <br>There were times when I would try to hit the vein, the artery to bleed out and to finally die.
    <br>When I was 12, I went on the internet and I literally typed it out on how to commit suicide.
    <br>It is surprising how many sites are there, encouraging people,
    <br>giving them methods how to commit suicide.
    <br>They encourage; they don't say, "Please, don't do it", they give structured methods how to do it -
    <br>step one, step two...
    <br>I've got a few ideas on that as well.
    <br>I've tried to electrocute myself.
    <br>I thought that if I could step in the bath with water, and I would cut a cable while it was plugged in and on,
    <br>and put it in the water, that it would electrocute me but it didn't work.
    <br>Recently, at the end of the last year, I was sleeping and then I woke up and I was in rage,
    <br>and I just thought to end it all - I grabbed the blade and I cut here, I hit the artery.
    <br>I cut it almost completely off.
    <br>I almost bled out.
    <br>The people I was staying with rushed me to the hospital; I was unconscious -
    <br>I couldn't really remember anything.
    <br>I remember; while I was there, I said, "I don't want to die".
    <br>I remember saying that when I felt that I was so close to death.
    <br>In the hospital, when I woke up and they got me stabilized,
    <br>the doctor told me that I had 30 millilitres of blood left inside of me.
    <br>He told me, "You have no idea how close to death you were".
    <br>It is physically impossible to even survive the drive from the house to the hospital on 30 ml of blood,
    <br>and I did, by the grace of God.
    <br>I didn't have brain damage or any other damage,
    <br>but by the time I got there, my organs started to fail and shut down,
    <br>but they didn't have any damage.
    <br>The first time I attempted it, I overdosed on pills because I thought that was the best way to do it,
    <br>and nothing happened, so I thought maybe I was doing it wrong.
    <br>I thought about going online; there must be a lot of people that have done it.
    <br>I just thought I could look for ideas there, and they gave me a lot of bad ideas.
    <br>It was really bad that they encouraged me.
    <br>I even asked there what the best, fastest and surest way to kill oneself was
    <br>if one has limited weapons or anything
    <br>because at that time, I was monitored by my mum, and I wouldn't have any weapons,
    <br>so I went to see what ordinary things I could use to kill myself.
    <br>I read that if you overdose on dettol, if you take a lot of it, it can kill you.
    <br>I have tried that but it also didn't work.
    <br>So you mean you physically drank dettol - the liquid - in an attempt to commit suicide?
    <br>Yes, they said that if you took enough of it, your lungs would swell up,
    <br>your heart would stop and you would die.
    <br>When I was 12, I started cutting.
    <br>From then till now, the cutting has gotten worse and worse.
    <br>At the beginning one cut would be enough to numb every emotion,
    <br>but the more I cut, the deeper I had to go.
    <br>I wanted to see the blood flow.
    <br>The craving was more to see the blood.
    <br>At the later stage, I started craving not to just see the blood, but also to drink the blood.
    <br>I started to crave that more and more.
    <br>The first thing that came was pain, an extreme emotional pain - it felt unbearable.
    <br>It came so suddenly.
    <br>After that thing, there was extreme rage.
    <br>Whether I wanted to do it or not, I still felt that I had to do it - I was like pushed into doing it.
    <br>It was like I would shut down and get everything ready and do it, regardless if I wanted it or not -
    <br>I just didn't have any control.
    <br>So, there was a force beyond your control, this urge that was pushing you to kill yourself and see blood?
    <br>Yes, it was.
    <br>I have tried to resist it on my own, but I just couldn't.
    <br>What about your dreams; can you describe to us the kind of attacks you were having spiritually in the nights?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since I was 8 years old, I had really bad nightmares.
    <br>I would dream about wild animals - tigers, wolfs attacking me,
    <br>I would dream of people abusing me in every kind of way.
    <br>I started to experience sleep paralysis; that was really horrifying to me.
    <br>I really didn't get a lot of sleep at all - it was really rare for me.
    <br>Either I would go to sleep and have a nightmare and when I woke up,
    <br>I didn't want to go back to sleep again because the dream would just continue,
    <br>or the whole night would be just a struggle to get the rage out that I was feeling,
    <br>and not to make any noise that somebody might come in and try to stop me.
    <br>The month before I came to The SCOAN, the attacks were getting worse and worse.
    <br>I would go for like a week without sleeping one night at all - just no sleep.
    <br>When I tried to sleep during the day, I would wake up and be in a rage.
    <br>Only in the month before I came here, I attempted suicide more than 15-20 times.
    <br>Even the night before I came here, I decided to end everything, that I mustn't come here,
    <br>I must die before I come here.
    <br>I don't know why but I was really scared.
    <br>We watched the movie "The Shack" about God's love, and I remember going to my room,
    <br>and I prayed to God and said, "God, I see Your love but I don't experience it".
    <br>Right then, they came into my room and told me, "You are flying to The SCOAN tomorrow".
    <br>I was so overwhelmed that I just gave the blades and the glass up.
    <br>Nothing really bad happened; because in the past, if I would give up blades,
    <br>I would experience hell, it would be a torture for more than a week -
    <br>I would really experience torture because I gave the blades up.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We understand that the night before our sister came here to The SCOAN,
    <br>she actually was very close to committing suicide,
    <br>but to the glory of God, that was the night she was told she would be coming to the church,
    <br>and she submitted the blades that she had secretly found, with which she wanted to end her life,
    <br>and God brought her here today, to The SCOAN.
    <br>Sister, we saw in the clip earlier; as Prophet T.B. Joshua approached you, you were crying out,
    <br>and suddenly, as he began to pray, your hands began to shake and vibrate.
    <br>Could you just describe to us, for the glory of God, what happened to you at that moment,
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua began to pray for you?
    <br>As he was standing in front of me, I held the photos, and he started shaking his hands,
    <br>and I just started shaking uncontrollably; I couldn't control it.
    <br>I can't really say what I felt - it was as if I was in kind of a fog.
    <br>Then he touched me on my head; it really hurt bad, and it felt like lightening or something had struck me.
    <br>So, all of that time you were not even conscious of yourself, when you were crying,
    <br>when that demon was manifesting, you just felt an electric shock hit you, as Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Have you ever experienced anything like that before?
    <br>No, never.
    <br>In the church I am now in South Africa - it is really a living church -
    <br>they have prayed for me a lot of times, but nothing would happen.
    <br>But now, to the glory of God; it has been one week since this encounter with Jesus Christ -
    <br>can you just testify to the world, what are the changes that you have seen in your life ever since then?
    <br>The changes are really incredible.
    <br>When he finally touched me, I felt lighter, I knew something left me, and I knew I was finally free.
    <br>My thoughts - they have really changed.
    <br>Normally my thoughts would be negative, disturbing and I didn't like it.
    <br>I would look at anything as a method to hurt myself, or to commit suicide;
    <br>anything could become a weapon.
    <br>Now, that is gone.
    <br>I can look at glass and knives and the thought wouldn't even come up.
    <br>As I looked on the tape, I saw the pictures of my open wounds, and normally that would satisfy me;
    <br>the deeper the wound, the more satisfaction,
    <br>but now, it really scared me to think that I really did that to myself.
    <br>In the past week, I really slept well - that's one thing that has changed completely.
    <br>I didn't have any nightmares in this whole week, which is really great,
    <br>because most of my life I had a nightmare or two every night.
    <br>I haven't experienced sleep paralysis even once.
    <br>I haven't had the urge to cut even once.
    <br>And the most important thing is: The pain of the past is over - it is over, and it doesn't hurt anymore.
    <br>Anything of the past is over - it is now just a testimony to glorify God.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, since that encounter, the negative, suicidal thoughts have disappeared?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I don't have any thought of hurting myself - everything is gone.
    <br>In the past week, my faith has grown so much.
    <br>I have experienced God's love for me.
    <br>Last week Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "Heaven knows you are here".
    <br>This week I experienced it.
    <br>It was so overwhelming for me to realise
    <br>that Heaven, the Creator of everything, He is interested in this situation.
    <br>I looked back on what happened in the past, and I thought,
    <br>"Wow, the devil really tried to stop me, so there must be an awesome testimony, future and destiny
    <br>that he doesn't want me to step into".
    <br>Now, giving my testimony is the first step into my destiny.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>All these are the scars that I...
    <br>Many of them have faded a lot, but these are no more to remind me of my past,
    <br>but rather they are a testimony to glorify Jesus.
    <br>My advice is: Anyone who is in my situation - do not give up hope, there is always hope.
    <br>There was a loving person who helped me; she paid for me to come here to The SCOAN.
    <br>She unconditionally loved me, like a mother, she was always there for me and supported me.
    <br>I know now, it was God loving me through her, God showing me His love through her.
    <br>Do not give up hope - by His stripes we are healed.
    <br>He has already shed every drop of blood for you.
    <br>You don't have to try to cover it with your own, because it is not going to work.
    <br>He already did everything for you.
    <br>People of God, the reason we are listening to this testimony and asking these questions
    <br>is to really encourage the world with what Jesus Christ is doing here.
    <br>The spirit that our sister was delivered from is the same spirit that we are seeing in operation around the world,
    <br>pushing people to join terrorist, militant groups that are involved in suicide bombing.
    <br>We read every day and see on the news what is happening.
    <br>This is the spirit that our sister was delivered from; a spirit that would push her to kill herself,
    <br>and even if she couldn't kill herself, that same spirit would eventually push her
    <br>to also end the lives of others.
    <br>As you heard her say earlier, the spirit was actually pushing her just to see blood,
    <br>and she tried to isolate herself because she felt if she was in the public,
    <br>she would even injure or maim others as well.
    <br>We can imagine the spirit that we are talking about, that our sister was delivered from.
    <br>That spirit is what is pushing people to travel overseas to join terrorist groups,
    <br>to actually end their own lives and kill innocent people, just to try to satisfy that evil spirit.
    <br>We give glory to God that our sister was delivered.
    <br>If not for this deliverance, who knows what would have happened.
    <br>Perhaps she would not only have ended her life,
    <br>but that spirit would have pushed her to also injure and affect others as well.
    <br>The light of God that exposed that spirit and sent the darkness packing in her,
    <br>that is the light of God that is present here, in the arena of liberty.
    <br>It is time for us to celebrate that light.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Yes; when the light of God speaks, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>We can see clearly that our sister is completely delivered from that wicked, tormenting spirit,
    <br>that wanted at all costs for her to end her life, to see blood, to kill herself and others.
    <br>Today, she is free, and that same power of God that set her free
    <br>is available for those who are ready and open to receive.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I'm Mara Kriel and I'm the mother of Danielle Kriel.
    <br>During this week, after the deliverance of Danielle, she sleeps completely through the night,
    <br>she doesn't have nightmares anymore, and the other thing is: She is very optimistic and enthusiastic.
    <br>She is talking a lot; in the past she didn't talk much to me, she avoided me, she was quiet.
    <br>She is completely changed - 180 degrees from what she was and what she now is.
    <br>Glory to God, and to the man of God, and to the people who support and sponsored us to come here.
    <br>All glory to God for His mercy and His grace.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Madam, as her mother, could you just compare her life before she came here to the differences now -
    <br>just give us a quick example of her life before and to the changes you have seen since that deliverance.
    <br>When she was still sick, I was watching her 24/7, and it took a toll on me.
    <br>She was not focusing, she was acting like a zombie, so to speak.
    <br>This even had an influence on my work.
    <br>I feel rest, complete peace now that she is here and she has been delivered.
    <br>She sleeps during the night and she is fine.
    <br>I'm very grateful.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Don't despair, God is there for everybody.
    <br>Jesus Christ gave His blood for us and we are created in the image of God.
    <br>Through the blood of Jesus Christ we can be saved, if we allow Him, if we act upon His Word,
    <br>and if we obey Him, there is hope for us; there is salvation.
    <br>There is joy, peace - only God can give peace.
    <br>Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus - I'm completely free!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Danielle Kriel and I'm from South Africa.
    <br>Three weeks ago I was delivered from the spirit of suicide.
    <br>My life has completely changed around; I couldn't sleep, now I sleep like a baby throughout the night,
    <br>I don't have any more nightmares, no more depressive thoughts, everything is positive,
    <br>I'm getting happy again and I'm thinking about my future - something that I normally didn't do.
    <br>I've been so blessed in these 3 weeks - it has been a really awesome experience.
    <br>My faith has grown so much.
    <br>I've learnt so much through the lectures every Sunday service - it has been really amazing.
    <br>I'm feeling awesome; I'm very strong.
    <br>My spiritual life has really grown - I feel confident in my relationship in Jesus Christ.
    <br>These 3 weeks changed my life.
    <br>I'm really going back a wholly different person than the person that came here.
    <br>No more thoughts of suicide, depression, of hurting myself or others.
    <br>No more negative thoughts; everything is positive; thinking about the future,
    <br>praying a lot and engaging with God - my relationship has grown stronger.
    <br>With my mum, the reconciliation also happened; and the relationship with God.
    <br>Even to come here, we couldn't afford to come here - someone had to sponsor us to come here,
    <br>where I stayed for 3 months - this person said she was going to pay for us coming here.
    <br>Our sister is fully equipped to go back to her home, to her country,
    <br>and maintain the deliverance, and to make the Word of God the standard for her life.
    <br>Sister, right now, we actually have a wonderful message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua said on behalf of himself and Emmanuel TV partners around the world,
    <br>he really wants to support you, as you start your new life in Christ Jesus,
    <br>returning back to your country - South Africa.
    <br>Especially in the area of your academic life, and to provide for you and your mum,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said he is here to present to you the gift of $2000.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We needed this.
    <br>We didn't expect this coming here, we just expected deliverance.
    <br>We have been blessed so much, spiritually and financially.
    <br>We have been blessed with the faith tools - thank you, man of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Do not give up hope; no matter how dark things seem.
    <br>God will use one of His servants, someone that is willing to listen to Him,
    <br>to shine His light and His love in your darkness.
    <br>I have experienced it.
    <br>It seemed that there was no hope - this was my last bus stop,
    <br>and I said, "If this doesn't work, then nothing is going to work".
    <br>There is always hope - never lose hope; hope in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I'm Mara Kriel, I'm from South Africa.
    <br>She is delivered completely.
    <br>She is so happy, enthusiastic.
    <br>She is now talking about the future; things which she didn't do in the past.
    <br>I'm very grateful.
    <br>Thank God, for His mercy and His grace.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua - to give us this gift on his birthday - we are very grateful.
    <br>And I thank God for my daughter - I've got my daughter back - she is talented.
    <br>May she just expand in her spiritual life and wisdom.
    <br>Really, I'm overwhelmed, because I've got so many financial constraints.
    <br>When I'm going back, there are a lot of things to pay and this money will come in very handy.
    <br>Just for Danielle - for her education, I will not worry for that part anymore.
    <br>That's wonderful - thank you, man of God.
    <br>Never despair, God is there.
    <br>Even if your life is in a dark pit, never give up hope, because God is light, He is Spirit, He is Love.
    <br>We are created in the image of God.
    <br>If He is interested in making a small snowflake, with such detail - just for a while, and then it fades away,
    <br>it melts - how much more does He care about me and you.
    <br>We are in His image.
    <br>What can I say?
    <br>Thank God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
