    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Let the power of the Lord from Heaven above
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Every familiar spirit, hindrance - be caged!
    <br>Be caged!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say to you, you darkness - let there be light!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer in Jesus' Name
    <br>After the mass prayer, the evil spirits inside this lady speak out.
    <br>Let's hear what they have to say.
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>I am the queen mother.
    <br>Who is the number 2?
    <br>I am the queen of the coast, snake and the family idol.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>As a snake, what have you done to her?
    <br>We move in her body.
    <br>What is this mark for?
    <br>It is our symbol.
    <br>Symbol of what?
    <br>Manifestation In Jesus' Name
    <br>We use it to monitor her in our kingdom.
    <br>T.B. Joshua prays for her in the name of Jesus, and she is set free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My name is Rosemary Edem.
    <br>Here is my mum - Mary Magdalene from Ghana.
    <br>My daughter.
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Here is my auntie - Benedicta.
    <br>My sister Jessica.
    <br>Another sister of mine - Belinda.
    <br>My uncle.
    <br>Another uncle - John.
    <br>It all started when I was very young - at the age of 7.
    <br>My mum used to have a room and in that room, there were some idols -
    <br>believed to be mermaids.
    <br>Some had three heads.
    <br>The one with three heads is called Dansu in our language (Volta Region).
    <br>It is believed to be a mermaid in the sea.
    <br>There were other images like crocodile, snake and a woman with a fish.
    <br>My mum was asked to worship those idols because it is believed
    <br>where we are coming from that we have water spirits.
    <br>At that age, I was asked to make a covenant with the idols, which signifies that
    <br>I would inherit those idols from my mum upon her death.
    <br>The covenant was made this way: I was wearing a white cloth - half-naked,
    <br>and I was kneeling behind my mum.
    <br>A cow was killed during the ceremony and they poured the blood into a calabash.
    <br>I dipped my middle finger in the blood and placed it on my tongue.
    <br>That was how the covenant was made.
    <br>After that covenant, growing up, I encountered challenges.
    <br>I was not happy, I was always angry for no reason.
    <br>When I reached the age of 25 to 27, the water spirit brought married men my way.
    <br>I would only meet married men.
    <br>When I dated them for a while, the spirit would put anger in me
    <br>and I would fight with them and the relationship then ended.
    <br>In their marriages they would encounter challenges, fighting with their wives.
    <br>In the end, their homes would be destroyed.
    <br>You mean to say, sister, that right from the beginning of your life, you realised that
    <br>only married men approached you and were attracted to you. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It continued until I met my baby's father who was also a married man.
    <br>Along the line, I became pregnant, and I had a baby.
    <br>That spirit made me to be angry and fight with him all the time until the relationship just ended.
    <br>Now I am alone with the baby, and the baby is right here.
    <br>After that, I used to dream about a huge, giant man. Sometimes, the giant man would sleep with me.
    <br>Sometimes, he would carry me up.
    <br>Sometimes, I would give birth in the dream - in the river.
    <br>I would go to the river like in normal life, pick up the baby,
    <br>and we would walk for some distance - somewhere.
    <br>Then, I would come back with that man.
    <br>I would eat and fly in the dream.
    <br>These problems continued - disappointments; always meeting married men.
    <br>One day, I told my mom that "this is not normal. I need some answers".
    <br>We went to see a fetish priest.
    <br>After divination, it was revealed that I had a spiritual husband in the river
    <br>to whom I was supposed to get married to.
    <br>Otherwise, my life would be a total mess; things would not go on well with me.
    <br>I would not even get married physically or have kids.
    <br>So, I told my mum that I had no choice.
    <br>I had to go on with this physical marriage to the spirit because I also want to enjoy my life.
    <br>I told my mum and we went to see a fetish priest.
    <br>He told us to buy some items - a white cloth, two sets of rings, Florida water,
    <br>oil, a white bucket, local sponge, and beads.
    <br>We went with the fetish priest to the riverside around midnight.
    <br>That was were the marriage was supposed to take place.
    <br>This is something that happened physically?
    <br>Yes, physically.
    <br>We went there and then the spiritualist took me to the river.
    <br>We left the river banks and went for a distance into the water.
    <br>I was completely naked in the water.
    <br>There I was given a white dove.
    <br>The spiritualist told me to speak into the ears of the dove,
    <br>telling the dove all my problems, and I did that.
    <br>I was then asked to walk some distance and throw the dove very high into the sky.
    <br>I did that and the dove flew away.
    <br>As soon as the dove flew away, the spiritualist told me, "That is your spiritual husband over there".
    <br>He came there physically but he came in the form of a bright light - far away.
    <br>He told me that was the spiritual husband.
    <br>So that is how you got married to this demon in a physical ceremony?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What were the things given to you as a symbol of this demonic marriage?
    <br>When we left the river, we went to a place where they gave me two sets of rings.
    <br>They gave me one.
    <br>This is mine and I am supposed to wear it on this finger like this.
    <br>This represents my marriage to a spirit.
    <br>The other one, which belongs to the spirit, was placed where there was an idol.
    <br>That was for the spirit.
    <br>Just show us the ring you are talking about.
    <br>You mean to say that after this spiritual ceremony at the riverside at midnight,
    <br>this was the ring given to you as a symbol of that spiritual marriage
    <br>and you had to wear it all the time?
    <br>Yes. I had to wear this ring to represent the marriage to a spirit.
    <br>I was not supposed to remove this ring.
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I was given some beads to wear on my hands; I threw them away. This one was for my waist.
    <br>All the beads represented my marriage to the spiritual husband - spirit in the river.
    <br>These beads you are holding - you had to them around your waist all the time?
    <br>All the time - yes.
    <br>After you had this spiritual marriage, what were the conditions that you were given;
    <br>the strange conditions you found yourself in because of this situation?
    <br>After the marriage and after these things were given to me,
    <br>I was given another bath with Florida water
    <br>and they poured some powder on me.
    <br>On that powder, there was an image of mermaid.
    <br>After that, I was given a white cloth to tie.
    <br>Some instructions were given for me to follow.
    <br>I was not allowed to sleep with a man on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays
    <br>because that is when the spirit would come and sleep with me.
    <br>On those days - Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays - I was to dress in white.
    <br>I was asked to pour some soft drinks on the floor to praise my spiritual husband.
    <br>These were the things you were doing after you involved yourself in the spiritual marriage?
    <br>Yes, I have been doing that.
    <br>Do you have a image that shows when you were in that form
    <br>so we can understand more about what you are saying?
    <br>Here is the image.
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Just explain to us what we are seeing on the screen. What does the image show?
    <br>This image was taken when I had a spiritual bath.
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We have heard it all from our sister.
    <br>She is explaining that this is something that happened physically.
    <br>You can see how she is dressed in white and had the powder on her,
    <br>which represented this mermaid spirit that was within her.
    <br>She actually did not only have this spiritual husband in the dream,
    <br>but she actually entered physically into a covenant, an engagement, with this spiritual husband
    <br>by going to the riverside.
    <br>So after this, sister, what continued to happen to your life?
    <br>After the covenant and spiritual marriage, things became worse.
    <br>I had nightmares, disappointment, spirit of anger. I used to get angry.
    <br>I used to beat my daughter; I beat her a lot.
    <br>This is a picture here, showing how I beat her one day.
    <br>You mean because of that anger -
    <br>when the spirit of anger comes, you would start to physically abuse your daughter?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What are we seeing on the picture of your daughter?
    <br>Is that your daughter in the picture?
    <br>That is a picture of my daughter's back after I had beaten her one day, after the spirit had come upon me.
    <br>I would get angry a lot. I was always moody; I didn't smile.
    <br>The spirit made me very angry.
    <br>After doing all this, I didn't see any improvement.
    <br>I was disappointed.
    <br>I told my mum that even after this marriage, things are still the same.
    <br>Maybe something went wrong. Maybe the spiritualist didn't do it well.
    <br>So I told her that I wanted to go and consult another spiritualist
    <br>to find out why things were still not moving in my life.
    <br>My mum didn't want to take me but I pleaded with her that I wanted to be happy.
    <br>She took me to a fetish priestess where I was supposed to make another covenant.
    <br>The priestess told me that I had to make a covenant with my own spirit.
    <br>She told me that everything was going to be OK as it would make the covenant complete.
    <br>I went through with the covenant.
    <br>We bought some items like cola nut. I grounded it. The fetish priestess mixed it with a drink.
    <br>She invited my own spirit who came in the form of a man.
    <br>I was seated outside and I heard a spirit speaking in another language.
    <br>The fetish priestess translated to us what the spirit was saying.
    <br>The spirit said I had to make a covenant with him
    <br>so that for whatever purpose I came to this world would be accomplished.
    <br>The drink was given to the spirit in the room, and I heard the spirit sipping the drink.
    <br>After that they gave the remaining drink to me, and I drank it.
    <br>We can understand how this spirit has really pushed our sister in the past to go to numerous spiritualists,
    <br>to engage in many demonic covenants because of her background.
    <br>As we heard earlier, right from her family background,
    <br>there was a marine spirit that was being worshipped
    <br>and all of the challenges she faced later in life were as a result of this demonic entanglement.
    <br>That spirit led me to get some tattoos on my body.
    <br>There was a woman in my neighbourhood who had tattoos of lion, dove, snake and a heart sign.
    <br>When I saw the tattoos on the woman, I fancied them immediately.
    <br>I got attracted to those images.
    <br>I told the woman that I really liked what she had on her body
    <br>so I wanted to get the same designs.
    <br>She took me to a place where I then got those tattoes.
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>This is a dove.
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Here is the image of a lion.
    <br>We just want to see exactly what our sister is talking about.
    <br>She said that that evil spirit actually pushed her to get several tattoes,
    <br>which we heard earlier during the deliverance
    <br>where the demon confessed that it was a symbol of that kingdom.
    <br>We are just seeing on the screen here what she is exactly talking about.
    <br>She said that on her arm is the tattoo of a lion.
    <br>That was as a result of what she saw another lady having on her body.
    <br>That pushed her as well to get another tattoo.
    <br>Is there any other tattoo you are having on your body, sister?
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She is also showing us that there is another tattoo on her lower back.
    <br>As we heard, it was the evil spirit that actually pushed our sister to do this.
    <br>We can see that apart from that, there is another one on her leg,
    <br>so she has tattoos all over her entire body.
    <br>This is the tattoo of what, sister?
    <br>A snake.
    <br>Ok. In the midst of all of this, you entered into so many spiritual covenants,
    <br>going to different fetish priests and witchdoctors.
    <br>How did you finally come to be in The SCOAN several weeks ago
    <br>where you received your deliverance?
    <br>After all these covenants, things were the same.
    <br>I got very depressed. I started having neck pain.
    <br>The pain was so severe that I could not turn my neck very well.
    <br>When I told my mum, she said this time around I had to go for deliverance
    <br>and deliver myself from all these covenants.
    <br>Because there came a time when I felt a movement all over my body, my back.
    <br>Things were moving all over my body. I couldn't understand it.
    <br>So I came to The SCOAN for deliverance and healing.
    <br>It was through that deliverance that the spirit manifested.
    <br>Can you describe what happened to you during the time of mass prayer
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua began to pray. Just describe that experience.
    <br>During the mass prayer, the spirit was telling me to go.
    <br>But I didn't go, I remained seated and I was sweating.
    <br>Then, all of a sudden, I could smell the perfume that was used to bathe me
    <br>when I had the spiritual marriage by the river.
    <br>I could smell the perfume all around me. I turned around but I could not see anybody around me.
    <br>So I knew the spirit came physically to attack me in the church.
    <br>Then, all of a sudden, I saw myself on the floor.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty. After that experience during the mass prayer,
    <br>we saw that later on Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>What happened when he prayed for you?
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me, I felt as if a very big hammer hit my head.
    <br>Very huge and everywhere was dark and I saw lightning.
    <br>I just fell down and screamed. Immediately, the spirit left me and I became light.
    <br>I became light.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>As we can see on the screen that is how our sister received her complete deliverance.
    <br>from this demonic attack that she had right from the beginning of her life.
    <br>Sister, to the glory of God: Ever since your deliverance here at The SCOAN,
    <br>what are the changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>Ever since that deliverance, I became like a new-born baby.
    <br>I sleep very peacefully without having any nightmares.
    <br>I have not seen the spiritual husband coming to me anymore.
    <br>To God be the glory, the neck pain just disappeared.
    <br>I was surprised that I could turn my neck.
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I told my mum that I could not believe this. Before I could not turn my neck but now I am free.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>That is the power of deliverance.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty that our sister was set free from that demonic spirit.
    <br>You mean to say, sister, that since then, you took off the ring, the beads
    <br>and everything that connected you to that marine kingdom
    <br>and now you are completely free?
    <br>Yes, I am free.
    <br>First of all, I would like to give thanks for my daughter's deliverance.
    <br>My name is Mrs Mary Magdalene from Ghana.
    <br>The family from which I come from...
    <br>I was told that when I was ten years old, my great-grandmother was impregnated by a man.
    <br>But when she was impregnated and her time was due to deliver,
    <br>she could not deliver so they went to a fetish priest to find out what the problem was.
    <br>The fetish priest told them that my great-grandmother had met a man
    <br>who was not an actual human being but a spirit from the sea.
    <br>They had to perform some rituals before she could deliver.
    <br>So they performed these rituals for the marine spirit.
    <br>Immediately they finished the rituals, the baby came out.
    <br>Since then, when growing up, things became difficult for me too.
    <br>Each time I would sleep and wake up in the morning, I would find money in my brassiere.
    <br>It occurred many times.
    <br>I told my sister-in-law who took me to a fetish priest.
    <br>This fetish priest told me that I belonged to the river.
    <br>That there is a spirit called Dansu.
    <br>I would have to marry that spirit before I would stop seeing all these things in my dreams.
    <br>Because it is a signal for me to trace where I am coming from.
    <br>So they did it.
    <br>They laid a table. They invited the fetish priest.
    <br>They laid a table with this marine spirit with three heads - a snake, crocodile and mermaid.
    <br>They told me to worship it every day.
    <br>I have been doing this.
    <br>When my daughter was growing up, things were also not going well for her.
    <br>I remembered that before they performed this ritual on me,
    <br>my daughter was 7 years old and they told me that I had to choose one of my daughters
    <br>so that in the future, upon my death, she would inherit the idols and carry out the spiritual rights.
    <br>Sorry, Madam. The rights you are talking about with these idols - how did you go about it?
    <br>How did you perform these sacrifices to these gods?
    <br>I would kill turkey and ram every year.
    <br>They would take me to the sea and bathe me
    <br>and from there, coming to the house, they would kill the ram.
    <br>We would cook it and all of us in the house would eat it.
    <br>When my daughter was growing up, she was facing the same problems.
    <br>So I took her to a fetish priest and we realised she had the same problem.
    <br>They took her to the river and bathed her as she described it earlier.
    <br>So what you are saying, Madam, is that you as her mother were performing these rights,
    <br>these rituals with these gods, goddesses, idols.
    <br>You would go there and actually slaughter some animals before these goddesses. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But after that I consulted a priest...
    <br>Before you get to that area, Madam...
    <br>You mean to say that because of this, all of your family members were possessed by this marine spirit?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>This problem was in the entire family?
    <br>In the whole family.
    <br>One of my aunties refused to perform these rights. She became mentally ill.
    <br>Finally, by the grace of God, your daughter came to The SCOAN several weeks ago
    <br>and she received her deliverance.
    <br>Tell us: Ever since her deliverance, what are the changes that you have seen in her life?
    <br>Mrs Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Since I came here, any time I speak with her, I see a lot of changes.
    <br>Before, when I talked to her, she would always attack me.
    <br>Then you keep quiet.
    <br>Now, she is normal. She is talking like a normal person. She is friendly to me.
    <br>I believe strongly that she is delivered.
    <br>So I thank God!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mrs Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>You mean to say, Madam, that you have come for your own deliverance
    <br>and for the deliverance of your whole family?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Hallelujah. Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>One more time, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mrs Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We are just listening to the experience of our mother.
    <br>The reason for this is that we believe a valuable lesson can be learnt from the experience they are sharing.
    <br>As we heard from our mother - she just briefly explained that
    <br>her background is seriously entrenched in this worship of marine spirits.
    <br>She said that according to the story told to her,
    <br>her great-grandmother actually became pregnant for a man,
    <br>not knowing that the gentleman that she became pregnant for was not a physical human being
    <br>but a spirit that came from the water.
    <br>By the time she was to give birth to that baby, they had to perform a ritual in the water
    <br>before the baby came out.
    <br>Ever since then, their family has been worshipping marine spirits.
    <br>Our mother here said that she actually had a number of idols in the house
    <br>that she would perform rights and rituals to.
    <br>She would sacrifice different animals before these gods.
    <br>At the age of seven, her young daughter that we listened to earlier
    <br>was actually dedicated to the gods as the person who would take over from her upon her death.
    <br>But despite all the ceremonies, rituals and sacrifices, the problems in the family continued to persist
    <br>and all the members in the family were afflicted with this marine spirit,
    <br>to the extent that one of her sisters that refused to worship the marine spirit,
    <br>became mad, having a mental problem.
    <br>Thankfully by the grace of God, our sister came to The SCOAN several weeks ago
    <br>and after her deliverance, her entire family came
    <br>and they have testified to the changes in her life.
    <br>Once again, we give all the glory to God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mrs Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My advice to the whole world is, even if you have a headache or stomach ache -
    <br>anything that happens to you in this life - never go anywhere.
    <br>Assuming you have a headache - because of fear, you go to a fetish priest
    <br>to find out what is happening.
    <br>They will tell you so many stories which are not true.
    <br>But my advice is that you should seek God first.
    <br>With God, everything is possible.
    <br>That is my advice.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mrs Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I would advise everybody to be patient in life.
    <br>If you encounter any challenges in your life, just pray to God.
    <br>Rely on God.
    <br>When it is time for your breakthrough, it will come.
    <br>Nothing should push you to go to the home of a fetish priest.
    <br>It will not help you. They are all liars.
    <br>It is only God who can save us.
    <br>Amen. One more time, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Rosemary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We believe the entire family has been touched by God by the coming to The SCOAN
    <br>and we are sure that the deliverance that happened to our sister -
    <br>the same deliverance will happen to the remaining family members.
    <br>And we know that as you go forward and make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
