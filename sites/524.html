  <p>    
    <br>The doctor told me that they are going to amputate the arm of my son.
    <br>I was in pain since that time.
    <br>Please note: The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature and shows severe open wounds.
    <br>What this child is facing is a huge burden for such a young boy to bear.
    <br>This little boy has an arm ulcer at the age of 4.
    <br>At this age, he is supposed to be playing freely, running freely, enjoying life.
    <br>But how can he play with his friends with such a problem as this.
    <br>As you can see, satan's sicknesses are the thieves of joy.
    <br>Let's hear from his father.
    <br>My name is Adegoke Ogunade. I am 36 years old.
    <br>We can see a boy sitting on your lap. Who is he to you?
    <br>He is my son.
    <br>Can you tell us his name and his age.
    <br>His name is Favour Oluwatobi Ogunade. He is 4 years old.
    <br>What is the problem that has brought your son to The SCOAN today?
    <br>The problem is arm ulcer.
    <br>You mean your son is having the problem of arm ulcer?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How has this problem of arm ulcer affected your son?
    <br>How has he been feeling with this problem?
    <br>He has not been alright. He cannot sleep.
    <br>We have spent a lot of money, going from one hospital to another for different treatments.
    <br>But still, there was no solution.
    <br>Who told you about The SCOAN?
    <br>One of my sisters told me to come here today, and
    <br>we believe that God is going to answer our prayer and heal him.
    <br>How do you feel as a father seeing your son in this kind of condition, with this kind of sickness?
    <br>I am not happy at all. I am not ok whenever I see his arm.
    <br>Now that you are here with your son at The SCOAN, what do you believe God Almighty would do for him?
    <br>I believe God will heal him - totally heal and deliver him.
    <br>Amen. We pray with you that God Almighty will heal your son and
    <br>set him free from this sickness of arm ulcer, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>This boy is just minutes from his miracle because Jesus Christ is just a moment away.
    <br>Faith is a force that moves your words to work.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua is praying, he speaks the word of faith
    <br>to every giant, every Jericho, every problem in the lives in these people.
    <br>They have been taken out of their problem, and they shall not go back.
    <br>God is making a way where there seems to be no way.
    <br>Just as He did for Moses, when He divided the Red Sea.
    <br>Every wall is being crumbled. Every giant is being destroyed.
    <br>The foundation of every problem is being shakened.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Be free!
    <br>Let's see how God uses Prophet T.B. Joshua to command this boy's problem to go, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Be free!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Adegoke Ogunade.
    <br>My son's name is Favour Ogunade.
    <br>He had the problem of arm ulcer.
    <br>I have been to many places looking for a solution.
    <br>One of my inlaws directed me here.
    <br>The day I came here, we were placed at the emergency section of the church.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed for us that very day,
    <br>and that same day we saw the difference.
    <br>The doctors told me that they would have to amputate my son's arm.
    <br>I was in pain since that time.
    <br>But today, I thank God that I have the joy in testifying that my son is now healed.
    <br>Before, he had a big sore and even had difficulty in wearing clothes.
    <br>I thank God that today, there is no more sore, no more pain and no more crying.
    <br>Now, he can use his arm, play with his friends and go to school.
    <br>I give glory to Almighty God!
    <br>To God be the glory. For the benefit of those listening to you,
    <br>can you tell us what the things were that your son could not do then, because of his problem of arm ulcer?
    <br>Before, he could not play; he could not sleep.
    <br>In the night, he would cry in pain.
    <br>Now he is alright!
    <br>He can now go to school and play ball with his friends.
    <br>Now he can use his hand to eat, write and play.
    <br>I give glory to Almighty God.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in the life of your son.
    <br>For the benefit of those listening to you,
    <br>can you show us the spot where your son had that problem of arm ulcer.
    <br>Could you tap him like this before ?
    <br>No, I could not try it.
    <br>Why?
    <br>It was a big sore.
    <br>He was always in pain and crying, all day long.
    <br>But ever since you brought him, and the anointed man of God prayed for him,
    <br>and God Almighty set him free totally, he has been free indeed of the problem. Isn't it?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We thank God. Now that the Lord has healed your son and released you of that problem,
    <br>the pain of taking him to places for solution, what is your promise to God?
    <br>My promise to God is to train my child in the way of the Lord
    <br>and serve Almighty God and I will go and sin no more.
    <br>We'll pray with you that the Lord will grant you the grace to see yourself as a foster
    <br>and train your child in the way of the Lord.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>His problem is a thing of the past.
    <br>His sorrow has been turned to joy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
