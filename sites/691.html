    <br>OPEN FLESH CLOSES After PRAYER
    <br>Madam, we welcome you to The SCOAN today, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Please, tell us your name and your age.
    <br>My name is Ifeoma Okonkwo.
    <br>I am 52 years old.
    <br>Tell us the problem that has brought you to The SCOAN today.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN today, is neck and back ulcer due to diabetes.
    <br>I went to the hospital and they injected me everyday, but no solution.
    <br>How has this problem affected you in your daily activities?
    <br>I cannot walk; I cannot lay on my back.
    <br>I have to lay on my side.
    <br>This my good Samaritan is there to help me with everything.
    <br>I cannot go to the toilet.
    <br>She is the one helping me, but she is not my family.
    <br>Let us hear from her.
    <br>Madam, we welcome you to The SCOAN today, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Tell us your name and your age.
    <br>My name is Fidelia Nwokenta.
    <br>My age is 34 years old.
    <br>When we went to the hospital - this thing is not a small barrier.
    <br>It started with a small boil.
    <br>Can you tell us how you came to know about this woman?
    <br>I am a nurse and I was helping her with her ulcer.
    <br>She is a diabetes patient.
    <br>So, you have been the one that has been helping her since she has been having this problem?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How have you been helping her?
    <br>I have been helping her; she cannot walk, get up, lie down like this or on her back.
    <br>Even to turn; someone has to help her to turn over.
    <br>Even to turn her neck, two people have to help her.
    <br>She cannot turn it.
    <br>She cannot put her head down.
    <br>This pain was very severe.
    <br>All of the time, she is crying because of the pain.
    <br>Now that she is here at The SCOAN, what is your belief in Jesus Christ?
    <br>I believe that God can do it.
    <br>I have seen many people that God has healed here and that is why my faith is in God.
    <br>I believe that God will heal her.
    <br>We pray with you that God Almighty will set this woman free from this problem of neck and back ulcer,
    <br>due to diabetes today, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>When God called His children out of Egypt, He made a covenant of healing with them, in Exodus 15:26.
    <br>Mrs Okonkwo has come to Jesus Christ seeking a healing touch that would reverse her case
    <br>from problem to solution.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua is praying for her, in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and this woman's situation is about to change
    <br>because God will not leave her without healing.
    <br>You are free!
    <br>She is standing up!
    <br>Before now, she could not walk because of the pain, but look at her now.
    <br>She is immediately testifying that Jesus has taken her sickness and healed her.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.

    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ifeoma Okonkwo.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN, was neck and back ulcer.
    <br>The sore started as a boil.
    <br>I went to the hospital.
    <br>At that time my problem started.
    <br>I could not talk well.
    <br>I could not walk.
    <br>I could not eat.
    <br>I did not have any strength.
    <br>I could not do anything on my own.
    <br>OPEN FLESH CLOSES After PRAYER
    <br>I thought I would die.
    <br>I was in the hospital for two months but no solution.
    <br>They gave me special injections everyday.
    <br>The whole treatment - all in vain.
    <br>They brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me, he said I was free.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You are free!
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, he said that I am free.
    <br>And I am free.
    <br>OPEN FLESH CLOSES After PRAYER
    <br>When he said that I am free, the pain was gone, my strength returned and I could eat anything I wanted.
    <br>OPEN FLESH CLOSES After PRAYER
    <br>I have got strength.
    <br>Since that time, I can walk, I do everything and within two days, the wound dried up.
    <br>OPEN FLESH CLOSES After PRAYER
    <br>All the problems I have passed through,
    <br>if not for the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, I would be finished, but God loves me.
    <br>God set me free.
    <br>People, help me to shout, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Emmanuel!
