  <p>    
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to use your faith to put a demand.
    <br>Ask for God's sanctification.
    <br>Sanctify me, Lord. Come into my heart. Wash me with your precious blood. Save my soul, Lord.
    <br>Cleanse me with your precious blood.
    <br>Ask Him to cleanse you with His precious blood.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I believe your heart is right now the temple, the altar, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is a very important issue we need to know.
    <br>It's not only when the man of God attends to you in person.
    <br>When the man of God is attending to someone and you are there, and you are seeing what is happening,
    <br>your faith grows, more than even the person the man of God is attending to,
    <br>because you have the time to listen.
    <br>Opportunity to listen to what the man of God is saying,
    <br>to understand what the man of God is even saying, better than the person he is attending to.
    <br>This is how to build faith with what you are seeing everyday.
    <br>And most of you that watch Emmanuel TV, it is a gracious blessing,
    <br>especially when you are in a place where an anointed man of God is preaching,
    <br>or delivering a message and you are there sitting down watching,
    <br>or healing or prophesying, telling people something that is so awesome.
    <br>You are also surprised how a human can know all this. You that are listening - they are faith builders.
    <br>Nothing can build faith than that.
    <br>Looking at a man of God, praying for a sick one who is crying for help,
    <br>and you are there when he walks towards him and prays for him,
    <br>and the sick man stands up and starts walking. Ha!
    <br>That is a faith builder.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, 'Faith builder'.
    <br>[Faith builder]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Faith builder]
    <br>And you need this faith to put a demand.
    <br>It is by faith you can say to God 'I'm sick'.
    <br>It is the also by faith you can say to the man of God,
    <br>'Man of God, please I'm sick. Pray for me'. It is by faith.
    <br>You can't just come to your senses or feeling to say, 'Man of God, pray for me. I am sick'.
    <br>There is nothing like that in the Bible.
    <br>You can only say it by faith.
    <br>So, we put a demand on the anointing by faith.
    <br>You need that faith. That is why the Bible says only faith pleases Him.
    <br>It means there is nothing you can do with Him without faith.
    <br>By faith, we put a demand on the anointing of God.
    <br>The testimony you have been hearing is just enough to take you there.
    <br>When it is  time like this, it is time to pay attention - attention with devotion.
    <br>How do we pay attention to this?
    <br>You also have to be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>Like I'm taking to you now, you are supposed to be praying.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, as you are looking,
    <br>paying attention to what I am saying, be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>Continue to pray.
    <br>Simple language - we have given you some words that have been anointed.
    <br>"Lord Jesus, take more of me", this word has been anointed for a long time.
    <br>The Lord gave you that language. It is for you and it has been anointed.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of you, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Take more of me - more of your purity, more of your holiness".
    <br>As you are talking, your lips should not move.
    <br>It's not going to disturb your attention and concentration.
    <br>Do you know that as I am talking to you, I am praying? Ha!
    <br>As I am talking to you, I am praying.
    <br>Why?
    <br>This word is passing through two natures - from Prophet to Mr. T.B. Joshua to you.
    <br>You can not see that Prophet but you can see Mr T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Prophet is taking it from God, and Prophet is giving it to T.B. Joshua and T.B. Joshua is telling you - this is it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, what are we saying?
    <br>When you are listening, you have a role  to play.
    <br>Not just to pay attention - to be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>To pay attention with devotion is to be in an attitude of what? Prayer.
    <br>So, now a word has been anointed for a long time.
    <br>"Take more of me and give me more of you - more of your holiness, purity, faithfulness, kindness."
    <br>Continue to say that.
    <br>This is the time for you to learn how to pray in the spirit.
    <br>You don't know how to pray in the spirit.
    <br>All the prayer you know how to pray is "In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus."
    <br>This is what you are used to.
    <br>Like I am standing looking at you, I am praying -
    <br>that is Spirit prayer.
    <br>Oftentimes, "In the name of Jesus" is saying words, not praying prayer.
    <br>There are two.
    <br>It is not everybody that says,  "In the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" that is praying; many are saying words.
    <br>This is why it becomes so tense; because we engage our physical appearance - ourselves.
    <br>Because the Spirit prayer does not need [punching with hands]
    <br>If Spirit prayer, prayer by the Holy Ghost, needs [our physical appearance],
    <br>we need to go everywhere before the prayer is answered.
    <br>How can we stand here and send the prayer to the U.S., and the prayer is answered there immediately?
    <br>No it means it does not need this [punching with hands]
    <br>If it needs this [punching], we have to travel to the United States to get it to happen.
    <br>You can have that faith that moves mountains, if you pay attention.
    <br>That is, pray as you are listening to me.
    <br>Be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>There are many things you are entitled to as I am talking to you.
    <br>Many things you are entitled to: One, you are supposed to be seeing things of celestial, vision,
    <br>seeing the immaterial world.
    <br>As you are looking at me, you should be seeing the forces behind this man. What is within? What is outside?
    <br>But you cannot see anything; you are only seeing a man talking to you.
    <br>That is why it is always difficult for you to believe.
    <br>If it's just this man that is talking you are looking at, it will be very difficult for you to believe.
    <br>For your belief to have a foundation, you must see beyond this appearance and you must see that vision.
    <br>Even before coming here, you are supposed to know much about this man, even before coming here.
    <br>It's only difficult when just a man like you, having appearance,
    <br>a similar appearance, every appearance you have he has, is now talking to you.
    <br>We have been to the university, we have lecturers, we have professors.
    <br>I mean, he will look like a lecturer to you, "This man is lecturing me".
    <br>Unless you see beyond this appearance.
    <br>When you see beyond this appearance, the job is half done.
    <br>The job is half done.
    <br>"Let us pray" - whether you have faith or not, you begin to pray.
    <br>This is what Christianity has turned to, and Christianity says you must have faith to pray
    <br>because if you do not have faith and you are praying,
    <br>by what authority would you put a demand on the anointing?
    <br>When you don't have faith, and you are now praying to God,
    <br>okay, by what medium, by what authority would you put a demand on the anointing?
    <br>This means you are using a net to fetch water.
    <br>Mark 5, verse 34.
    <br>"He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has healed you.
    <br>Go in peace and be freed from your suffering'.
    <br>That shows that faith releases healing anointing.
    <br>Faith releases blessing anointing.
    <br>Faith releases deliverance, faith releases breakthrough.
    <br>What you are looking for - faith releases it.
    <br>He said, 'Go, your faith has healed you. Be freed from your suffering'.
    <br>We all regard faith as a Heavenly currency.
    <br>The more currency you have, the more Heavenly resources you purchase.
    <br>You agree with me?
    <br>Are you praying with your heart?
    <br>Simple prayer - "Take more of you, give me more of you." This is to fortify you, to overhaul you.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of your holiness, more of your righteousness, more of your purity."
    <br>Continue that. The Lord will take it up and will be saying it for you.
    <br>Then, your faith will begin to grow and grow.
    <br>You have more Heavenly currency to purchase Heavenly resources.
    <br>We don't just listen to the Gospel; we listen to the Gospel by being in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>When you are at home, and you tune your channel to a Christian channel,
    <br>and you hear a preacher preaching, immediately, you too begin to pray.
    <br>If not, what he's saying, will enter here and go here.
    <br>Like I am talking to you now, you must be in attitude of prayer, "Take more of me, give me more of you.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of you, give me more of your faithfulness,
    <br>more of your obedience, more of your holiness, Lord.
    <br>Give me more of your holiness, give me more of your purity". So you begin to . . .
    <br>As you are saying it, you will just see your heart open,
    <br>and when your heart opens, you will begin to see me by your heart, you see visions.
    <br>You can only see visions when you see something with your heart,
    <br>but with your eyes you cannot see any vision.
    <br>You know, your heart is the prayer room. Your heart is the temple of God.
    <br>You want to see visions? You must see with your heart.
    <br>Inner my heart. Lord, I want to be like Jesus. Inner my heart.
    <br>Are you praying?
    <br>You must learn how to pray in the Spirit.
    <br>If you are a type that prays, like okay, you want to catch a flight, you are at the airport,
    <br>you will minimize talking to people because your time to talk to people is the time to pray.
    <br>You must create time for yourself.
    <br>Everywhere can be an altar. Altar of God - everywhere. When you sit down, you begin to [pray].
    <br>When you enter the plane, immediately you are entering, you start praying too.
    <br>When you sit down, you begin to pray.
    <br>Satan will not catch you unprepared
    <br>because the situation we face today is that satan keeps catching people unprepared.
    <br>Look at your dream. At the time you want to shout Jesus, satan has finished with you.
    <br>Okay, this is a good example. This is a crisis and I don't know.
    <br>It is like a blind man wanted to cross, but no Jesus.
    <br>I'm suddenly falling, and if I am now falling down, and say, "Jesus! Jesus!" No, it is for a selfish reason.
    <br>You want Him to save you; that is why you are calling Him.
    <br>But if Jesus has been part of me here, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus",
    <br>then He will save me because He has been the source of my life not because of a situation.
    <br>That is what we are facing now.
    <br>Start it now! That is the secret of my life.
    <br>As I am talking to you now, I am praying. When I am eating, I do pray. I am used to that.
    <br>When you have a certain time that you pray, satan will catch you before that time.
    <br>He has his own strategy and tactic, and he uses it.
    <br>What you started today will be very very difficult at the beginning,
    <br>but know you are playing your role before Jesus comes to play His own.
    <br>Do not give up.
    <br>Faith is a vacuum that draws the anointing from Jesus,
    <br>and that faith you are building now, the best faith builder is what you started now.
    <br>Prayer in the Spirit, "Take more of me, give me more of you".
    <br>Even self-healing will happen.
    <br>You will be very surprised that there is sickness you have been talking about,
    <br>and suddenly you wake up and find out that it's gone!
    <br>Yes, it will happen!
    <br>Brother, can I ask you a question?
    <br>What are you saying in your heart, tell the world.
    <br>"Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me, give me more of you, more of your strength, more of your companion,
    <br>more of your Holiness. Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me and give me more of you."
    <br>And you are saying it now now? As you are looking at me, you are engaging in it?
    <br>You are saying it? And do you promise to continue this?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You need to try what you have never tried before to get something to change your life.
    <br>Sit down, sir.
    <br>It's a revelation for you. I am pointing you to the way of success.
    <br>I want you to stand up now to make this covenant, that this is what you need to be doing now.
    <br>And there is a word that as been anointed for you, '"Take more of me, give me more of you,
    <br>more of your faithfulness, more of your kindness, more of your goodness and more of your self-control".
    <br>If you are able to do this without your lips moving, without your body moving,
    <br>without people around you knowing that you are praying, the sky is your limit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have to make a covenant now; a promise to God.
    <br>Are you praying now?
    <br>By the time you start this, very soon, you cannot stop it. Something will continue.
    <br>Do you know blood? The way blood runs in your body?
    <br>That is the way the prayer will be running in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But you must start it first.
    <br>Just like Peter said to Jesus, "I want to come with you".
    <br>"Let me see your faith first." That is Jesus for you.
    <br>That is, let me see your faith means begin your coming; I will help you.
    <br>He does not just walk to you and says ''Be healed!" He wants you to show your faith first.
    <br>Jesus always wants to give us what we do not know how to do so that He can teach us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>"Jesus always wants to give us what we do not know how to do so that He can teach us".
    <br>His instruction is always what you don't know how to do so that He Himself can teach us.
    <br>This is exactly what applies to the prayer.
    <br>If you know when Jesus will answer you, you will only pray at that time.
    <br>But since you don't know exactly when He will hear you, you keep praying. Very interesting.
    <br>That is why He is God.
    <br>He is always giving us what we don't know how to do so that He Himself can teach us.
    <br>This is why He said, "I will make you fishers of men, fishers of men, fishers of men".
    <br>If you know how to do that fishing, He doesn't need to show you.
    <br>Peter was walking along. When Peter got to a certain level of the water and the water swallowed him,
    <br>and he realized that he is about to drown, it was only his hand that we could see up.
    <br>But Jesus realized that he insisted. Instead of going back, he was going forward.
    <br>You know when you are about to drown, you are to run back.
    <br>But instead of Peter to run back, he continued and persisted.
    <br>Jesus said, "Oh no, this is genuine willingness".
    <br>He stretched his hand and said, "Here is my help."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Here is my help", and immediately Peter floated on the sea without a life jacket.
    <br>Imagine without a life jacket he floated on the sea.
    <br>In the same way, what is good for Peter is good for you.
    <br>So yes, your genuine willingness is needed.
    <br>Start it now. "Take more of me, give me more of you" - this is the only way.
    <br>No matter the miracle and blessing you receive here, to maintain them, you need Jesus.
    <br>Anybody can receive miracles, but not anyone can maintain them.
    <br>In the same vain, all the blessings you have at home: you have cars, you have this,
    <br>you were once a millionaire, you were this and that. You are unable to maintain them.
    <br>Maintenance is what we are talking about; it is not the blessing.
    <br>The blessing of God given to you; how to maintain them in the face of challenges.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of you."
    <br>You move with the Kingdom of God, you move with Heaven all the time but you do not know.
    <br>You keep asking for Heaven, but Heaven is with you; you move with Heaven.
    <br>You say, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Where is Jesus? Jesus is with you.
    <br>Your heart. My heart is Heaven.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of you.
    <br>Lord Jesus, more of your faithfulness, more of your kindness, goodness, self-control.
    <br>In Jesus' name."
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Let me pray with you, raise up your hand.
    <br>Nothing shall take you from this promise.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>You are standing today to promise before God that His Word will continue to run in your heart!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>His word will continue to run in your heart!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Yes, His Word will continue to run in your spirit!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Yes, His Word will continue to run in your heart.
    <br>Prayer is the key, prayer is the key.
    <br>Prayer is the master key.
    <br>Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer.
    <br>Prayer is the master key.
    <br>Simple! He started with prayer and ended with what? Prayer.
    <br>It means 24/7, you have to be in an attitude of what? Prayer.
    <br>To be in an attitude of prayer means in the heart. Heart means spirit. Like you are looking at me now,
    <br>Your mouth is not moving.
    <br>A good example for the viewers all over the world. Can you see the woman?
    <br>She's praying Spirit prayer in her heart.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of you."
    <br>How are you, mum?
    <br>I'm fine, daddy.
    <br>You are still praying? Does "How are you" stop you from praying?
    <br>No.
    <br>How are you? I'm fine, thank you.
    <br>Are you okay? I am fine, thank you, sir.
    <br>Have you taken your breakfast? Yes, daddy.
    <br>Does this stop your prayer? No, daddy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, this is what we are talking about.
    <br>What we're used to, we Christians today -
    <br>Good afternoon, daddy. How are you, daddy?
    <br>Oh I am sorry, I am sorry, I was in the ..., you know.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok, you talk to me again.
    <br>Good afternoon, daddy. How are you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is hypocrisy.
    <br>We love to be seen, we love to be noticed, we love attention.
    <br>You see my situation now, the way I walk, you greet me
    <br>because I want you to see me. This is what you people do outside there.
    <br>Good afternoon, daddy. How are you?
    <br>I'm not fine.
    <br>I am sorry, daddy.
    <br>Okay, I am okay now because of that sorry.
    <br>This is attention we love and this keeps destroying us. It is not good.
    <br>Can you see our mother here now?
    <br>She is in an attitude of prayer, and that is the prayer that breaks the yoke.
    <br>24/7 when you are going on the street.
    <br>Okay, move to the camera and begin to pray in your heart.
    <br>How are you? I'm fine, daddy? Continue again.
    <br>That is the life you should begin to live from now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the life you should begin to live from now.
    <br>That is the only way.
    <br>[Trust and Obey]
    <br>The word "trust" means 24/7.
    <br>There is no break in trust.
    <br>That is why the word trust is stronger - no break.
    <br>When you say, "I trust this thing", it means 24/7.
    <br>If you trust Jesus 24/7, the prayer you are used to today,
    <br>it is because you cannot exercise this kind of prayer while you are walking.
    <br>"In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name, Amen, in Jesus' name, Amen, in Jesus' name."
    <br>We must shout, we must make noise, we must let people know we are praying.
    <br>This is the kind of prayer we are used to, and that cannot work on the street.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you continue this spiritual battle, I am giving you five days. Wait.
    <br>What will happen, you will begin to speak in a new tongue; it will just come.
    <br>You will receive your right; what you deserve. You deserve excellence.
    <br>From now until Friday. Write it down, madam, you will come and give testimony.
    <br>I am using this woman as a good example to the whole world.
    <br>Viewers at home, you start it now. Start it now!
    <br>What are you saying in your heart? Tell us!
    <br>"Jesus, have more of me and let me have more of you; more of your goodness,
    <br>more of your faithfulness, more of your love, more of your peace."
    <br>Don't let any challenges stop you from saying that.
    <br>Even as you begin this journey now, there will be a lot of challenges
    <br>because if satan knows that you are about to get out of his way, he will bring a lot of challenges;
    <br>big challenges to stop you.
    <br>When your heart is disturbed, you can't say anything. Refuse to be disturbed.
    <br>By Friday or Saturday, you will just find that you are not praying,
    <br>but something is just praying, like a blood flowing in your heart.
    <br>You wait here in the church until next Saturday because I want to witness that promise.
    <br>I am talking to everyone here. I am talking to the viewers all over the world.
