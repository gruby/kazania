    <br>Your heart is God’s room, not sitting room.
    <br>“Your heart is God’s room” means “Your heart is prayer room”, not sitting room.
    <br>“Your heart is God’s room” means “God’s prayer room”.
    <br>What are you doing with your heart?
    <br>Have you forgiven those who have sinned against you?
    <br>What are you holding?
    <br>Is your heart imprisoned – pain of the past, envy and jealousy?
    <br>If your heart is not free, there is no place for God because your heart is God's room.
    <br>You have the opportunity, grace now before we begin to pray.
    <br>You can begin to reconcile now.
    <br>Say to yourself, “I mean it”.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong – someone wronged you – you have no right to hold offence.
    <br>If you hold a grudge against your brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>A grudge against a brother - whether you are right...
    <br>You were intentionally cheated for a reason not known to you...
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we cannot pray without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>You must know where you belong before we pray.
    <br>Where do I belong?
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>I belong to the presence of God because in His presence, you are strong, content, satisfied.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, begin to reconcile yourself.
    <br>Begin to forgive and forget.
    <br>Forgive me as I forgive those who sin against me.
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>You must mean it.
    <br>You must allow your heart to speak for you because the real thing about you is your heart.
    <br>Your spirit, your heart is the real thing.
    <br>Allow your heart to speak for you.
    <br>Mean it with all your heart.
    <br>In Jesus’ name, we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Those of us that are still wrestling with our past, pain of the past, offence in the past,
    <br>I pray you will be released, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>You are not here to meet a man but you are here to meet God.
    <br>God is not a man.
    <br>In Jesus’ name, you are released.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>From the pain of the past, be released in the name of Jesus.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>From that bitterness, be released, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Viewers, I lay my hand upon you, to release you from that pain of the past.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>I lay my hand upon you.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Pain of the past, be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Receive that nature of God, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Amen.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>I want to believe you are released.
    <br>Will you believe with me?
    <br>You can be seated.
    <br>Since you believe with me - two believers are better than one, if they are one.
    <br>Since you believe with me that you are released, you are released.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Now, you can sense God’s presence.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Are you sensing God’s presence?
    <br>(Yes.)
    <br>It is your time to meet the Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>As we move, the Spirit releases His message.
    <br>These are faith words that will build you, not just counsel.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>When we say, “I am a faith man”, many of us don’t know what it means.
    <br>We just hear people saying, "I'm a faith man; I'm a faith woman."
    <br>What does it mean to you to say, “I’m a faith man; I’m a faith woman”?
    <br>That is our name as Christians - "I'm a man of faith."
    <br>You shouldn't call yourself a "faith woman" when you don't know what it means.
    <br>It means I trust in God with all my faith.
    <br>I'm a "faith woman"... - women, can somebody talk here?
    <br>To believe the Word of God...
    <br>When we say, “I am a faith man”, it means you use faith words and produce faith results.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>You use faith words.
    <br>Do you know what it means to use faith words?
    <br>If I say I am a faith man, I am using faith words to produce faith results.
    <br>If it does not produce faith results, it means my faith is faith in faith,
    <br>not faith in the finished works of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>What do I mean by the language of the Bible?
    <br>That is the language God used to create and to save us, to heal, to bless, to judge and to rule over us.
    <br>That is the language of the Bible.
    <br>The language of today is the language we use every time out there, to gossip, give instruction,
    <br>"Do this! You can do this!" - you don't mind what you say;
    <br>to talk to your children, "Please, you are stupid. Come here",
    <br>to sing songs - anybody can sing songs, even gospel songs, not even being a Christian,
    <br>to tell stories - this is the language of today,
    <br>to do business - you have a lot of fake business cards - stories, telling lies,
    <br>to do politics of today.
    <br>That is the language of today.
    <br>When you now say, “I’m a faith man” or “I’m a faith woman”,
    <br>it means you use faith words and produce faith results.
