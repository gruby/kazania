    <br>SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM TB JOSHUA!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, quite a long time...
    <br>Well, God's time is the best.
    <br>Now is God's time.
    <br>It is God's time to commune with you.
    <br>I love you; Jesus loves you the more.
    <br>What can separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>Absolutely nothing!
    <br>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
    <br>Having shared Yuletide greetings with you,
    <br>let us go to the message of today - 'Offence'.
    <br>I will take my reading from the Book of Luke 17.
    <br>You know, everything big starts little.
    <br>Luke 17:1
    <br>"Jesus said to his disciples: 'Things that cause people to stumble
    <br>are bound to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come'."
    <br>Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come -
    <br>that is, bound to happen - occur everywhere.
    <br>Offence has become so rampant and epidemic
    <br>and it has eaten into the fibre of our everyday relationships - unavoidable.
    <br>It is impossible to live this life and not have the opportunity to be offended.
    <br>I mean, it is impossible that no offences should come.
    <br>It is not a question of opportunity to be offended but what your response will be.
    <br>For preparation for the New Year, we must let go of offence
    <br>because offence is the effective instrument used by satan
    <br>to blind us on our present condition.
    <br>I want to pray with you for the preparation of the New Year.
    <br>By the authority in the name of Jesus, I release you from all hurts!
    <br>I release you from deep hurts!
    <br>I release you from whatever caused by offence -
    <br>bitterness, jealousy, anger, pain in the past -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command that spirit, every spirit offence might have caused in your life -
    <br>jealousy, hatred, anger, inferiority, resentment, strifes, outrage.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name I pray. Amen.
    <br>What is offence?
    <br>Offence is the use of negative words that register in the heart of the offended;
    <br>that brings about offence.
    <br>Honestly, offence is not deadly.
    <br>Feeding on it in our heart makes it deadly.
    <br>When we concentrate and focus on the wrong done to us,
    <br>we automatically forget the condition in which we are.
    <br>Focusing on ourselves is the effective instrument used by satan
    <br>to blind us on our present condition.
    <br>We say, "Why me? Why me of all this? Why me of all this accusation?
    <br>Why me of all this disappointment? Why me?"
    <br>While focusing on this, we automatically forget the reality of our condition -
    <br>no food on the table, no money in the pocket,
    <br>health challenges and so on and so forth.
    <br>In order to have Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour in this New Year,
    <br>we must let go of offence.
    <br>Right now, let us pray.
    <br>Whatever caused by offence in your life -
    <br>the spirit of jealousy, hatred, bitterness, anger -
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>By the authority in the name of Jesus, begin to release yourself!
    <br>By the authority in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>I command that spirit in your heart - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You need Jesus in the New Year.
    <br>In order to have Jesus, you must let go of offence.
    <br>As I said, offence is very common due to lack of real love.
    <br>We have almost come to believe that it is a way of life.
    <br>The truth remains - our lives are centred on how we are doing,
    <br>feeling and how we are treated.
    <br>How we are doing, feeling and treated is not about us but Jesus.
    <br>If the Word of God is true for your life, say after me:
    <br>'I believe You have answered my prayers.
    <br>I will continue to live under Your protection
    <br>and dwell in Your shadow the rest of my life. Amen'.
    <br>Viewers, thank you for your prayers and support.
    <br>We shall meet on Emmanuel TV live on the New Year's Eve Service.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Once again, in order to have Jesus as your Lord and Saviour this New Year,
    <br>you must let go of offence.
    <br>You know what offence has caused us -
    <br>bitterness, anger, strifes, outrage, resentment, jealousy, envy
    <br>and so on and so forth.
    <br>When you retain an offence in your heart, you filter everything through it.
    <br>You laugh, pray, smile and preach through it.
    <br>You sleep through it - this is the cause of nightmares.
    <br>Once again, thank you.
    <br>I can't wait to see you live on Emmanuel TV
    <br>for the New Year's Eve Service where we shall have the opportunity
    <br>to share with you God's opinion about you, your nation and your continent.
    <br>Thank you. God bless. Jesus is Lord.
    <br>Emmanuel!
