  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know God has an assignment for me.
    <br>When I was coming I kept asking God, what was I going to do?
    <br>I didn't know what I was coming to do.
    <br>At this time the Lord said to continue to go.
    <br>I'm here Lord, I'm waiting for my assignments.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I believe God has positioned you because if you are positioned you receive.
    <br>First you need to be positioned.
    <br>I believe you are positioned.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Say, “I have been positioned for healing, deliverance, salvation and prosperity.
    <br>I have been positioned. Thank You, Jesus!”
    <br>That is the first thing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I was asking God to give me the Bible verses and the one He directed me to...
    <br>I was asking God - this one is talking about the treasure in the church.
    <br>He said: No, that treasure in the church means the needy.
    <br>So, we take our reading from that Book of Mark 12 verse 41.
    <br>The widow's offering.
    <br>Are you here?
    <br>"Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put
    <br>and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury.
    <br>Many rich people threw in large amounts.
    <br>But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents."
    <br>You know what copper coins mean - worth only a few cents.
    <br>"Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said,
    <br>'Truly I tell you this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
    <br>They all gave out of their wealth;
    <br>but she, out of her poverty, put in everything - all she had to live on'."
    <br>I will call this an assignment from God.
    <br>This is an assignment from God to you.
    <br>Today, we all believe we can only give out of abundance.
    <br>Ask the poor widow and she will tell you that everyone has something to give.
    <br>Big or small, everyone has something to give.
    <br>In things both great and small, everyone has something to give.
    <br>Jesus cares so much about little things.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(Jesus cares so much about little things.)
    <br>I can't hear you
    <br>(Jesus cares so much about little things.)
    <br>He cares so much about your cent, your penny
    <br>He knows the number of hairs on our heads and He cares for a single sparrow that falls.
    <br>It is quite easy to give what our life depends on, what we cherish most, with little than when we have much.
    <br>When you have little, it is easy to give.
    <br>Whatever you give out of little means a lot to you and attracts God's attention.
    <br>Good example: you have just 5 dollars.
    <br>Whatever you give out of that 5 dollars means a lot to you and attracts God's attention.
    <br>More than giving a million dollars.
    <br>If you had one million dollars, you wouldn't know how much of it to give.
    <br>One million dollars is one million responsibilities.
    <br>If you don't know how much you need God in small things,
    <br>you cannot know how much you need Him in bigger things.
    <br>You don't know how much you need God to sit down.
    <br>When you want to sit down, you believe you can sit down without God.
    <br>This is the problem of all of us have today.
    <br>When you want to sit, you just sit down.
    <br>Not a single person can stand up to tell me:  "Before I sit down, I rely on God's strength".
    <br>"In the name of Jesus", before I sit down - no.
    <br>You believe you can do that on your own.
    <br>If you don't know how much you need God in small things,
    <br>you will not know how much you need Him in bigger things.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don't know how much you need God to laugh.
    <br>You will not know how much you need God to set you up from affliction.
    <br>So, you believe you can sit on your own, you don't need Him to sit,
    <br>you don't need Him to stand, you don't even need Him to laugh, you don't need Him to walk -
    <br>you walk freely on your own, you talk freely on your own
    <br>but when trouble comes, you say: "God, I need you. God heal me. God bless me."
    <br>God is constantly putting us to the test in the small things.
    <br>If you fail to bless others with the little blessing God has given to you, more may never come.
    <br>If you fail to appreciate God with the little blessing you have, more may never come
    <br>because if you don't appreciate Him in the little things,
    <br>you may not know how to appreciate Him in the bigger things.
    <br>It is easy to give God our quality time when we are nobody.
    <br>Quality time means there's no time that you cannot give God.
    <br>When you are nobody...
    <br>It is easy to give quality strength when we are nobody.
    <br>So, in the same vein, it is easy to give what our lives depend on, what we cherish most
    <br>when we're nobody than when we are somebody.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At your level now, you cannot give your quality time, what your life depends on what you cherish most -
    <br>the best of you.
    <br>When will you give your best?
    <br>When you become more important...
    <br>That time may never come.
    <br>That is what Jesus was talking about.
    <br>He said, "Look at the poor widow giving what her life depends on".
    <br>It does not mean we have to give all, but the little we part out of a little means much
    <br>and attracts God's attention.
    <br>She had little and she parted with little out of the little.
    <br>But out of abundance...
    <br>You know the reaction of the rich man, when he was asked to sell all his possessions.
    <br>He said he did not know where to start from.
    <br>"I don't know where to start from."
    <br>If you don't know how much you need God to talk, walk, smile, greet, dress up,
    <br>you will always have a certain occasion for prayer.
    <br>Because you believe you don't need God to walk.
    <br>That is why you have a certain occasion for prayer.
    <br>You believe you don't need God to sit - that is why you have such an occasion for prayer.
    <br>You believe you don't need God to dress up - that's why you have a certain occasion for prayer.
    <br>And a break in prayer is a break in faith and a break in faith is a break with God.
    <br>We don't know how much we need God; that is why we have certain occasions for prayer.
    <br>When you know how much you need God -
    <br>the Bible says, 'Pray without ceasing, pray continuously'.
    <br>When you know you need God to walk, talk, greet, sit, dress up,
    <br>you will not have a certain occasion for prayer -
    <br>prayer all the time; prayer without ceasing.
    <br>Your life, success, happiness, progress, depend on your willingness to help others.
    <br>Your progress in life - I mean your happiness and joy
    <br>depends on what?
    <br>Your genuine willingness to do what?
    <br>(To help others.)
    <br>To help others - to help the poor, needy.
    <br>How much you help the poor is how much you progress.
    <br>How much you help the needy is how much you succeed.
    <br>If you say you have little, more may never come;
    <br>it's too little to part with, it's too little to give out of,  more may never come.
    <br>God cares so much about little things.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(God cares so much about little things.)
    <br>He cares so much...
    <br>That is why he was watching the poor widow.
    <br>Instead of looking at the rich, He decided to watch the poor widow.
    <br>He cares so much about little things, how we manage little things.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(He cares so much about little things, how we manage little things.)
    <br>I can't hear you
    <br>(He cares so much about little things, how we manage little things.)
    <br>How you manage your little possessions, how you manage your little money.
    <br>He cares so much because more may never come.
    <br>Tell your neighbor.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>He cares so much and is concerned about us.
    <br>Oh, my people, it is easier to part with little than much.
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "Oh, my people, it is easier to part with little than much."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>You say, "I have little...".
    <br>Oh, this is a message from God to you.
    <br>For you to have peace, you need to be concerned about people around you.
    <br>Your life depends on your willingness to help.
    <br>Your joy and happiness depend on your willingness to bless others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take your pen and write this: "God cares so much about little things - little possessions, little money."
    <br>What you call "little money"?
    <br>"Little money" is just enough for your daily bread for your family.
    <br>That little - how you manage it; because more may never come.
    <br>That is why some people remain poor till now and keep complaining -
    <br>because of the way they manage the little they have.
    <br>Take note of many families or people you knew in the past - they remain poor or they get poorer.
    <br>You look at them - they keep complaining about being poor and they keep getting poorer.
    <br>This affects the children.
    <br>Many families live this way - many of them have to give their children up for adoption.
    <br>They see slavery because of poverty.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "They see slavery because of poverty".
    <br>"I have just little, that was given to me" - God is concerned about that little so much
    <br>because more may never come.
    <br>Why God is concerned about that little?
    <br>Because more may never come - that is why He is concerned.
    <br>This little - more may never come.
    <br>For more to come, you have to be ready to part.
    <br>Help the needy, help the poor.
    <br>If you say you are poor, there are others that are poorer.
    <br>We always have people that have less than us.
    <br>If you say "I'm very poor", you will always see poorer than you.
    <br>There are always people that have less than us.
    <br>Yes, if I'm talking to you ,let me see your hand.
    <br>Always.
    <br>When you say, "I'm very poor" - when you look, you will always find someone poorer.
    <br>If you say you are very sick, when you look around, you will see one that is more sick.
    <br>Someone is always there who needs what you have.
    <br>Tell your neighbor:  "Someone is always there who is in need of you"
    <br>God is always concerned; He wants you to grow.
    <br>There is a new day every morning - you just have to grow.
    <br>Because of how you manage your little possession, money, He is always concerned
    <br>because more may never come.
    <br>As you help, someone is there to help you.
    <br>The more you help, the more they help you.
    <br>The more you help someone who is in need of you, someone is there to help you.
    <br>Someone is waiting to help you, when you help others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Someone is waiting to help you when you help someone who is in need of you
    <br>but when you remain dormant, refusing to help,
    <br>someone who is waiting to help you will also remain looking at you.
    <br>What you are looking for, someone has it.
    <br>God has sent someone to help reshape your destiny
    <br>and that someone is waiting for you to help someone who is in need of your help.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Bless you!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>So now, it is a gracious thing for you to know that someone is waiting for you, for your help.
    <br>Someone is waiting for your support.
    <br>Someone is waiting for your prayer.
    <br>Someone is waiting for what?
    <br>Can you talk to me?
    <br>You know that someone is waiting for your help and someone also is waiting to give you.
    <br>As you help, you receive.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is a physical structure.
    <br>You are the Church; build people!
    <br>Go and build people; don't build the churches.
    <br>This is a physical structure, a building.
    <br>You are the real Church the Bible is talking about.
    <br>Church will build you; you can build church.
    <br>They should talk more about how to build humans - manpower.
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>Can somebody stand up and tell me the message you are taking home?
    <br>Brother... thank you.
    <br>Everyone has something to give.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>If you don't know how much you need God in a small thing,
    <br>you will not know how much you need God in a bigger thing.
    <br>God cares so much about little things.
    <br>For more to come, part with them - help the needy.
    <br>Thank you. Clap for him.
    <br>Anyone else?
    <br>Two lessons I am taking with me.
    <br>First one: "God cares so much about little things".
    <br>The second one: ...
    <br>That is God cares so much about little things.
    <br>And that "little things" is an idiom.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- OK.
    <br>What do you understand about the "little things", sir?
    <br>It can be your possessions...
    <br>- Thank you; little possessions.
    <br>- Little possessions.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- The little money you have.
    <br>Thank you; clap for him.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>God cares so much about little things.
    <br>That little means...
    <br>He is talking about average, less privileged.
    <br>What we consider as little?
    <br>Why is He so concerned about it?
    <br>Because we must manage it very well.
    <br>For this little to become big, we must be ready to give out of that just like the poor widow
    <br>because more may never come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And it is very, very easy to give with little.
    <br>You can give a quality one with the little you have, but it is very difficult to give quality with much.
    <br>You remember the rich man, for whom it was difficult to sell his possessions.
    <br>He said he hadn't known where to start from.
    <br>Because you can only give what you do not need.
    <br>If rich men want to give, they always give what they do not need.
    <br>If you met the millionaires, the rich - if you met them...
    <br>If Jesus met them, what they would do - they would open their garages.
    <br>Things they are going to give are not those they are using now.
    <br>These are things they have packed for many years.
    <br>They are still good, but they don't need them anymore.
    <br>The rich always give what they do not need, but the poor give what their lives depend on.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You want to say something?
    <br>Come on!
    <br>One message I'm taking from here; I must know that there is always somebody who is in need of me.
    <br>... who is in need of me.
    <br>No matter how little you have, someone is in need of you.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "No matter how little you have, someone is in need of you."
    <br>No matter how little you have, no matter how little money you have,
    <br>no matter how little possession you have, someone is in need of you.
    <br>I have also learned that we usually give quality time to God when we are nobody.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>But when we are somebody, then we don't have quality time for God.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>When we are nobody...
    <br>When we say nobody, maybe you just see yourself belonging to your family, work place or your church.
    <br>If anything happens to you, when you are little, your church will care, your family will cry,
    <br>people at your working place will worry.
    <br>These are the people who know you.
    <br>But when you become so known all over, and you become big and famous,
    <br>it is always so difficult to give out of abundance and riches - so difficult.
    <br>Unless you have been giving when you were little...
    <br>When you give while you are little, when you become bigger,
    <br>you will continue to give according to God's instruction
    <br>but when you say, 'Until I become bigger before I will start giving', more will never come.
    <br>If God wants to promote you, He will promote you for the needs of others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know; there are two promotions - God's promotion and devil's promotion.
    <br>"As I have given the money, not as the world gives them."
    <br>The world can give you money, possessions, promotion but not as God gives.
    <br>God gives with peace and joy.
    <br>There are conditions attached to satanic, demonic promotion, which one will pay dearly for.
    <br>You are saved to save others.
    <br>You are blessed to bless others.
    <br>If you are not ready to bless others, there is no need to bless you.
    <br>The condition to bless you is to bless others.
    <br>If it is not in your agenda to bless others -
    <br>God knows your hearts and He knows what will happen next.
    <br>You own now and God owns tomorrow.
    <br>If God knows you will not be there for the poor and the needy, more will never come.
    <br>Tell your neighbor: "If God knows you will not be there for the needy, poor, widows and orphans,
    <br>more will never come".
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Sit down.
    <br>Take your pen and write it down - I think this is good for you.
    <br>If God knows you will not be there for the poor, orphan, widow and widower, more will never come.
    <br>That is why many of us are still struggling with our poverty and hardship.
    <br>We keep praying to be rich for many years, but yet, no blessing
    <br>because you don't part with the little you have.
    <br>If you don't know how much you need 
    <br>God in small things,
    <br>you will not be able to know how much you need Him in bigger things.
    <br>Thank you.
