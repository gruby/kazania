    <br>Standard For Life
    <br>Good Morning, viewers all over the world.
    <br>You are welcome to another day.
    <br>Thank you for watching our last programme here in the Emmanuel TV Studios in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>We saw the rate you watched Emmanuel TV on YouTube.
    <br>Thank you for your concern and interest.
    <br>Thank you so much, viewers. This really encouraged us to come into your midst and speak to you again.
    <br>Not only us - any moment from now Prophet T.B. Joshua will be here in the Studios
    <br>to address you with the message from our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>So thank you once again and Good Morning!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Good Morning, viewers!
    <br>Let us not forget that Prophet T.B. Joshua said that this year, 2020 is the year of humility.
    <br>Indeed, we are humbled!
    <br>Yes!
    <br>The world is humbled by their situation and challenges.
    <br>Just as the Bible says, where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>True!
    <br>All we have to say is Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Let us start by reading the letter Prophet T.B. Joshua wrote and sent to President Donald Trump
    <br>of the United States on Thursday, 12th March 2020, before the 'shutdown' in most of Europe and America.
    <br>I actually have the letter here that was sent to President Trump and it reads thus:
    <br>"This travel ban on flights from Europe will cause a backlash.
    <br>It will affect the American economy the more and also the world economy.
    <br>It will also affect the forthcoming election in America - in one way or another.
    <br>The travel ban is not the best way to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
    <br>The initial measures America put in place are the best way - they just need to be reinforced.
    <br>Coronavirus is fear and fear lingers in the air.
    <br>Fear does not need to fly to America or any other country on a plane before being contracted.
    <br>In conclusion, we are on our knees praying.
    <br>The noise of coronavirus will be silenced before the end of this month - March, 2020.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers, take note that Prophet T.B. Joshua said there would be a backlash in the economy -
    <br>that is, there would be an economic repercussion if the country is shut down.
    <br>Viewers, what is happening around the world today?
    <br>We thank God that President Trump has already seen this economic backlash
    <br>and is now discussing how to reopen.
    <br>And other countries should follow in this footprint.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This reminds me of what Prophet T.B. Joshua has said:
    <br>The economy is the people and the people are the government.
    <br>If you shut down the people, you shut down the economy.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The effect on the economy may be worse after the outbreak of the coronavirus if the lockdown continues.
    <br>This is a prophetic word from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>No matter how much cash you inject into the economy,
    <br>no matter how much you give to every citizen,
    <br>money alone cannot revive the economy;
    <br>it is people who revive the economy because people are the economy.
    <br>People must work.
    <br>People must buy.
    <br>People must sell.
    <br>People must take transportation from one place to another.
    <br>People must cross the border from time to time.
    <br>When these activities stop, the economy is affected.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua says:
    <br>there are two sides to everything: politics and Spirit politics, economy and Spirit economy.
    <br>Today, we read so much about and study the economy but not Spirit economy -
    <br>just as we read the Bible but not the Spirit.
    <br>We, children of God, when we read the Bible, we are reading the Holy Spirit
    <br>but when we read the Bible without the Holy Spirit, we are just reading history.
    <br>In the same way, when you read economy without Spirit economy,
    <br>you are reading history of the economy which just refreshes but it does not renew.
    <br>Exactly, this is the hindrance.
    <br>The hindrances and challenges we face today come from our inadequate knowledge of Spirit economy,
    <br>just as there are so many in the Church today who read and study the Word
    <br>but they don't have adequate knowledge of the Spirit.
    <br>This has caused a backlash in the Church today.
    <br>Exactly. One thing we must know: The Word refreshes; the Spirit renews.
    <br>In the same vein, the economy refreshes; Spirit economy renews.
    <br>What is Spirit economy?
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua has said, Spirit economy is all about the future of the economy.
    <br>Exactly. Viewers, that is why we want to remind you what we said in our last programme.
    <br>This is the time for you to come and support your government
    <br>so that we can face this economic backlash and realise the future we desire, not the future we fear.
    <br>As you have said, any moment from now, Prophet T.B. Joshua will be in our midst with a message from God.
    <br>Remember what he said in the last programme.
    <br>When we begin to fear, we are giving place to the devil.
    <br>What we are afraid of, may likely happen to us.
    <br>Fear affliction like the coronavirus and you will likely be afflicted.
    <br>To put this issue right, coronavirus is just a mere superior to a fever or a cold.
    <br>It is like an upgrade. It will come but it will go.
    <br>We just need to make sure we take all the necessary precautions.
    <br>And thank you for saying that because this brings us to a question we all want an answer to.
    <br>What do we need to do now?
    <br>Viewers, the answer is quite simple.
    <br>We need to take special care of our elderly ones because their immune systems
    <br>may not be able to handle the coronavirus.
    <br>This is why we see high numbers of death rates among our elderly ones.
    <br>What do we do? We do all we can to support the elderly.
    <br>You are very right. This time the elderly really need our care, our love and our support.
    <br>Because the statistics show it - when a young person sadly passes away due to coronavirus,
    <br>it is as a result of a chronic sickness they already had,
    <br>meaning that their immune system just couldn't carry them.
    <br>So we can see that no matter your age group, any affliction can be deadly, depending on how you handle it.
    <br>A headache can kill just like the coronavirus can kill.
    <br>But in the midst of this there is hope; Jesus is our Hope.
    <br>As we read in the Book of Job, chapter 11. You can turn to chapter 11 and we will read from verse 13 to 18.
    <br>The Scripture says:
    <br>"Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,
    <br>if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,
    <br>then, free of fault, you will lift up your face; you will stand firm and without fear.
    <br>You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.
    <br>Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.
    <br>You will be secure because there is hope..."
    <br>Amen and amen.
    <br>Remember Wuhan, China - where the coronavirus started.
    <br>For more than one week, there is no record of any new case.
    <br>Let's listen now to the Director General of the World Health Organisation.
    <br>Wuhan, the Chinese city hardest hit by COVID-19, reported no new cases for the first time on March 18.
    <br>Wuhan provides hope for the rest of the world, that even the most severe situation can be turned around.
    <br>Of course, we must exercise caution. The situation can reverse.
    <br>But the experience of cities and countries that have pushed back this virus
    <br>gives hope and courage to the rest of the world.
    <br>It's a message of hope.
    <br>It's a message that this virus can be suppressed.
    <br>We can break chains of transmission.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua has already said, the coronavirus is fading away.
    <br>As he said, what has happened in Wuhan has brought hope to the whole world.
    <br>Indeed, hope - it has brought hope
    <br>and hope imparts that strength to endure whatever challenges,
    <br>whatever situation that seems impossible, just as we are in today.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we are encouraging you now - take heart,
    <br>be strong and resist that fear which the coronavirus has brought.
    <br>Rather let us focus on the issue of the day which is that economic backlash!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let us take this moment before Prophet T.B. Joshua comes into our midst and revisit his message.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said that the government is the economy and the economy is the people.
    <br>Let us look at this issue of shutdown because
    <br>when you shut down the people, you shut down the economy
    <br>and this is the aim and objective of no one other than satan himself.
    <br>The lockdown is affecting the economic world.
    <br>This is what satan, the author of the coronavirus, aims and desires - to cause hunger and destruction.
    <br>Exactly. He comes to steal our economy, to destroy our hope and to kill our future.
    <br>His aim is to destroy our life, our finances, our health.
    <br>This is what he is trying to do at this very moment.
    <br>Locking down is only giving satan the opportunity to achieve his aim and desire.
    <br>Let us refuse to give him a chance!
    <br>Refuse!
    <br>Refuse!
    <br>Exactly, viewers, refuse to give satan that chance.
    <br>We want to assure you that we are on our knees as a team praying for you,
    <br>praying for your nation, your government, your people.
    <br>I want you to take solace in this Word of Scripture from the Book of 2 Chronicles 7:14.
    <br>Viewers, if you have your Bible, turn it with us to that Scripture right now.
    <br>And the Bible says this:
    <br>"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray
    <br>and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
    <br>then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."
    <br>Amen!
    <br>On that note of promise, viewers all over the world, we leave you here in faith
    <br>and we expect to meet you very soon in faith,
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua will come into these studios any moment from now
    <br>with the wonderful message from our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank you so much for joining us!
    <br>God bless you all! 
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God with us!
    <br>Standard For Life
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>We shall be taking our reading from three Books -
    <br>the Book of Job 23:10,
    <br>the Book of Exodus 14:13
    <br>and the Book of Psalm 13:2-3.
    <br>Let me read the Book of Exodus 14.
    <br>I will take my reading from verse 13.
    <br>"Moses answered the people, 'Do not be afraid.
    <br>Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today.
    <br>The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.
    <br>The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.'
    <br>Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Why are you crying out to me?
    <br>Tell the Israelites to move on.' "
    <br>Yes.
    <br>"Tell the Israelites to move on."
    <br>Viewers, let us stay where we are and hold steady and trust God.
    <br>Don't forget He has rescued you in the past,
    <br>He will rescue you now and He will rescue you in the future.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>You don't need to be worried; you don't need to give up.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>God sometimes puts us in the dark so that we may see the light.
    <br>Brothers and sisters, do not fall for the temptation to act out of character.
    <br>"I am this, I am that. I am a Christian. I've been doing right.
    <br>I've stopped stealing, killing, destruction." This is self-righteousness.
    <br>If you are with God in truth and faith, whatever you are passing through,
    <br>if God permits it,
    <br>I mean, if God allows it as a trial, you must not consider it unusual
    <br>and begin to query or question your faith, question your belief.
    <br>Let us take control of our situation
    <br>instead of being afraid, for satan, the cause of crises, has been defeated.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Don't because of your situation cut off your duty to God.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Don't listen to the panic of the moment.
    <br>Yes, it happened. Crises here, crises there.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>This fear, that fear.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>This is their season!
    <br>Warfare is necessary for our victory.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Last meeting, I shared with you one of my habits.
    <br>I am going to share with you today, one more.
    <br>Let us move there.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Yes!
    <br>My viewers, you deserve what I deserve - this is revelation.
    <br>In the morning, you take a cup of hot water and two lemons.
    <br>Cut them into small slices and put in the cup.
    <br>After three to five minutes, begin to sip it as a drink.
    <br>Refill it three times.
    <br>I will not mind doing it in the exact way.
    <br>I am going to cut it.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Demonstrating One Of His Daily Habits - Drinking Hot Water With Lemon
    <br>This is hot water.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Demonstrating One Of His Daily Habits - Drinking Hot Water With Lemon
    <br>I will advise you to walk around your compound or premises
    <br>as you are sipping.

    <br>After three to five minutes, sip it as a drink.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Demonstrating One Of His Daily Habits - Drinking Hot Water With Lemon
    <br>When you are moving and sipping, it helps digestion.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Demonstrating One Of His Daily Habits - Drinking Hot Water With Lemon
    <br>Refill it three times.
    <br>To show you how effective this is, look at me before.
    <br>And now, look at me!
    <br>Imagine what has been flushed out!
    <br>Irrespective of what is in your system, it will be flushed out!
    <br>I will advise you while sipping it as a drink, move around with it.
    <br>As I have said, it helps digestion - moving around with it.
    <br>If you are not fit enough, sip it and move around with it.
    <br>For those of us that are fit enough, you can still do press ups
    <br>when you wake up in the morning.
    <br>This is my habit. I am going to demonstrate it.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today
    <br>This is it!
    <br>If you are fit, you are advised to do press ups.
    <br>It energises your system.
    <br>Thank you viewers for your time.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>What kind of challenges are you facing?
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Ask Jesus to give you the grace to always cast your burden upon the Lord.
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot heal. Never a disease He cannot cure.
    <br>Never a burden He cannot bear.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know your motives are all mixed up
    <br>but certainly, you want to follow Jesus.
    <br>Your motives are all mixed up -
    <br>where you want to go is not where you are going,
    <br>what you want to say is not what you are saying,
    <br>what you want to do is not what you are doing.
    <br>Your motives are all mixed up but certainly, you want to follow Jesus.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>The fear of this, the fear of that seems to paralyse you.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Jesus, release us from our fear, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Release us from our fear, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I loose whatever bondage of fear - be loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever bondage of fear - fear of this, fear of that -
    <br>be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Jesus is ready to pick us up and put us back on our feet.
    <br>He is ready.
    <br>He is ready because He wants us to be the person He created.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Lord Jesus, thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>He wants us to be the person He created.
    <br>Help us, Lord.
    <br>Help us, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Open our heart to Your faith, open our heart to Your Word,
    <br>open our heart to Your Spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus, deliver us with Your righteous hand.
    <br>Deliver us, Lord, with Your righteous hand.
    <br>Deliver us, Lord, with Your righteous hand, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Those on the sickbed - we place them in Your hands, Lord.
    <br>We place them in Your healing hand.
    <br>Heal them, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliver them, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Guide the medical professionals working on them!
    <br>Guide the medical professionals working on them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Guide the medical professionals working on their bodies, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Use them to restore their health, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.

    <br>To maintain our blessing,
    <br>determine to set aside a special time each day to read your Bible with devotion.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name,
    <br>I leave you in faith and I am expecting to meet you in faith.
    <br>This prayer is not time-bound.

    <br>Thank you.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
