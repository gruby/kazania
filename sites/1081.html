  <p>    
    <br>I want you to open your heart.
    <br>You have to be free from any torture of the enemy of your soul.
    <br>You know how the enemy tortures us -
    <br>by bringing the words of anxiety, sadness, depression, worrying about the future.
    <br>That kind of language going on in your heart is enemy's weapon to torture you.
    <br>Reject any torture from the enemy of your soul.
    <br>Anxious, sad, depressed, worry about your future, downcast.
    <br>These are enemy's what? - Torture.
    <br>Begin to reject it right now. Reject it.
    <br>Begin to reject any torture from the enemy of your soul.
    <br>Any torture -  those words that are going through your heart to torture your heart, torture you,
    <br>worry about your future - reject it, in the name of Jesus and be free!
    <br>Leave it for God!
    <br>Reject any torture from the enemy of your soul -
    <br>anxiety, sadness, doubt, worry about the future.
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Stop worrying! Stop worrying about your healing!
    <br>Stop worrying about your blessing .
    <br>Stop worrying about your future!
    <br>Stop worrying about your situation. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>No man is without limitation. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[No man is without limitation.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[No man is without limitation.]
    <br>When you say, "Eh hen, T.B. Joshua! What is T.B. Joshua's limitation?"
    <br>It's not possible for T.B. Joshua to be praying for people  and at the same time being prayed for.
    <br>I'm here praying and you are receiving my prayer.
    <br>Why can't I be here and be there?
    <br>That is my limitation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>As I'm here now praying for you, "Be healed!",
    <br>can I also be there receiving that healing?
    <br>Eh hen! That is my limitation.
    <br>If I can be here praying and at the same time be there, receiving that blessing,
    <br>it means I don't have limitation.
    <br>So it means, where you are strong, I'm weak; where you are weak, I'm strong.
    <br>So when you know that no man is without limitation -
    <br>your limitation could be physical, spiritual, financial, emotional.
    <br>Just mention it.
    <br>What is your limitation?
    <br>This is why, before you come to the Lord, you have to rebuke any torture from the enemy of your soul.
    <br>Those tortures are from the enemy of your soul to make you think of your limitation.
    <br>Open your lips once again.
    <br>Before you begin to pray, even in your house, you have to get rid of torture from the enemy;
    <br>those things that make you worry.
    <br>As if you and God, God does not need you to do that.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to reject it right now - any torture from the enemy of your soul.
    <br>Depression, worry about now and the future is enemy torture.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>"How will I pay my debt?" - these are enemy torture.
    <br>Reject it!
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You don't need to worry. Leave it for God. Leave it for Him.
    <br>The moment you start leaving it for God, you start receiving breakthrough.
    <br>Leave it for God!
    <br>You need a free spirit; you don't need a worry spirit.
    <br>When your spirit is worried, you cannot contact God.
    <br>You just have to be calm.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Right now, let us restore our sight.
    <br>Our human eyes can be blind to His act of mercy.
    <br>Our human eyes can be blind to His act of healing, act of salvation, act of blessing.
    <br>Lord Jesus, restore our sight to see His mercy.
    <br>Restore our sight to see His healing.
    <br>Restore our sight to see His blessing.
    <br>Restore our sight to see His salvation.
    <br>When our eyes are restored, we will feel His touch.
    <br>Somebody touched me
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>When I was praying
    <br>Praying to my Father
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>When our eyes are restored, you will feel His touch;
    <br>you will hear Him say, "You are healed!";
    <br>you will hear Him say, "You are blessed!";
    <br>you will hear Him say, "You are saved!"
    <br>Open your lips now and pray to the Lord -  restore my sight, Lord.
    <br>My human eyes can be blind to Your act of mercy.
    <br>My human eyes can be blind to Your act of salvation.
    <br>My human eyes can be blind to Your act of healing.
    <br>Lord Jesus, restore my sight to see Your healing.
    <br>Restore my sight to see Your salvation.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Say, my dominion is in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I command you, you satan, you evil spirit - out!
