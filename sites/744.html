  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have seen the name, Jesus working in the Spirit.
    <br>We have seen the value of the name.
    <br>We have seen the value of staying in faith.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Maybe many of us don't know the name Jesus -
    <br>we call the name Jesus just as we call the name of a person.
    <br>You have seen the value of the name so much
    <br>and the value of staying in faith.
    <br>Congratulations!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm in the midst of successful people!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm in the midst of joyful people!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm in the midst of healed people,
    <br>delivered people, blessed people!
    <br>I know you would like to hear that.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit speaks, changes are beginning.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, changes are beginning.
    <br>I want to say to you - you will not remain and you will not go the same
    <br>because we are still standing on His Word.
    <br>His Word says, "Let there be light!"
    <br>That is the promise of His Word.
    <br>Are you sick? 
    <br>Let the sick come.
    <br>We are still standing on His Word and His assurance of salvation.
    <br>Let us rise up on our feet.
    <br>Jesus has given so much capacity to learn from our mistakes, our errors.
    <br>That is why you are here today.
    <br>If there was no capacity to learn from your errors, you would not be here today.
    <br>There are some errors you committed that would have led to death.
    <br>Many errors that you committed in the past that would have led to death,
    <br>by now they would have been pointing to your grave.
    <br>Many that are in the graveyard, they have never done so much you have done.
    <br>When you think back, many that are in the graveyard today,
    <br>many of them have not committed the error, mistake you have committed
    <br>but today they are pointing to their grave; their dream crushed.
    <br>These are the testimonies you are supposed to be giving -
    <br>so much capacity to learn from our mistakes,
    <br>our errors and move on.
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>You have done so much that would have led to your grave,
    <br>that would have led to death, or sick bed but here you are.
    <br>God has given us so much capacity to learn from our errors, mistakes.
    <br>Bow down your head now and ask God to give you enough grace to learn from your errors,
    <br>mistakes and move on.
    <br>Mistakes will come; you will learn and not fail and move on.
    <br>Bow down your head.
    <br>Ask God to give you enough grace to continue to learn from your errors, mistakes.
    <br>Ask God for grace. He has given you but He can still increase that capacity.
    <br>There is no limit to the grace of God.
    <br>What you have today can be increased, can be multiplied; that is why you are here.
    <br>Ask God! Grace, Lord!
    <br>Enough grace to learn from my error, mistake.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Mistakes will come so far as you are still living in the flesh
    <br>and you will learn and move on.
    <br>So, each time that mistake comes, it is not the mistake that matters,
    <br>but what you learn from it.
    <br>You say, "Why this mistake?" - no, never you say that when it comes.
    <br>You can count how many tests, examinations you've gone through.
    <br>Each time you need promotion, you should be ready for examination.
    <br>After passing the examination, you'll be promoted.
    <br>Mistakes will come, don't bother yourself - "Why this mistake, error?
    <br>Oh my God! I am a Christian. Why all this?" - No, no, no, it will come.
    <br>What if God allowed it?
    <br>If the tempter had consulted God, "Allow me to test this man".
    <br>If God allowed it, what will you do?
    <br>Issue of "Why all this? I failed this examination.
    <br>Oh my God, I am a Christian" - don't let that affect your faith.
    <br>It is time to apply your faith, not to bother.
    <br>Mistakes will come.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I mean, errors will come.
    <br>You will learn and move on.
    <br>There's capacity. 
    <br>There's ability.
    <br>He never promised to keep you away.
    <br>He never promised to keep you away from mistakes because He has given you capacity.
    <br>He has given you grace.
    <br>No mistake, no grace.
    <br>He never promised to keep you away from all this nonsense - challenges, temptation, whatever
    <br>but He promised to see you through.
    <br>If gold must be gold,
    <br>if you must be a Christian...
    <br>You are to answer that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>If gold must be gold,
    <br>if you must be a Christian...
    <br>You should answer that question.
    <br>What takes gold to be gold is what takes you to be a Christian.
    <br>If gold must be gold, it must pass through the furnace.
    <br>If you must be a Christian, you must pass through temptations and trials.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Those things that you would have smiled when it comes,
    <br>"Ah! Why this trouble?" -
    <br>promotion is coming; get ready to pass through it -
    <br>you are now complaining.
    <br>Get ready to be promoted to G.M., you must also be ready to go through some test
    <br>to see whether you will be qualified to be G.M.
    <br>If gold must be gold, it must pass through the furnace.
    <br>If you must be a faithful Christian, your character must be tested through rare situations.
    <br>Your test may be different from my test.
    <br>Yours may be sickness.
    <br>Mr. B may be hardship.
    <br>Mr. C may be accusation.
    <br>Mr. D may be affliction.
    <br>E may be limitation in progress.
    <br>There are some messages you don't need to sit down and receive,
    <br>there are many messages you must have to stand and receive; that is why you are standing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I need your body, soul, spirit attention.
    <br>Take this:
    <br>what takes gold to be gold also takes you to be a true believer.
    <br>Each challenge either moves you forward or backward.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit speaks, changes are beginning.
    <br>That is Holy Spirit.
    <br>Man has the ability to speak but the Holy Spirit speaks
    <br>and when He speaks, changes are beginning.
    <br>You must identify who speaks to you.
    <br>A man will walk towards you and speak to you,
    <br>and a man will also walk towards you and the Holy Spirit will speak to you through him.
    <br>Who is speaking?
    <br>Anyone can say, "Jesus is Lord" but not everyone can say it genuinely.
    <br>Anyone can say, "Be healed, in the name of Jesus!".
    <br>"Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!" - anybody can say that.
    <br>"Be blessed, in the name of Jesus!" - anyone can say that.
    <br>"Rise up and pray! Be healed, be delivered!" - anybody can do that.
    <br>If I give you the mic now, you will start saying it.
    <br>To make a change, you must stand on His Word and on the assurance of salvation.
    <br>By salvation you can be healed,
    <br>because that salvation will help you to maintain the healing.
    <br>If you receive without salvation, you cannot maintain it.
    <br>As you receive, it's gone.
    <br>You can be healed by salvation.
    <br>Nothing goes for nothing and nothing comes by chance.
    <br>Salvation - have healing, blessing, breakthrough.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have a role to play; the prayer is not just one-sided.
    <br>As you are sitting, continue to meditate; your meditation brings results.
    <br>With your heart, you see Jesus; with your heart, you walk with Him.
    <br>You agree with Him with your heart.
    <br>And you must take control of your heart
    <br>because our heart is just like this.
    <br>As you are sitting down, if you don't take hold of your heart,
    <br>as I am talking now, your heart will be telling you, "Who is this man? Look at him".
    <br>And you can't take hold - that is why you must take hold, arrest your heart.
    <br>It's not too late now, as I am talking to you.
    <br>"My heart" - let it look where you look.
    <br>Begin to say, "Take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>Begin to engage your heart.
    <br>If you don't engage your heart as you are looking at me,
    <br>you will be looking one direction and your heart will be saying nonsense.
    <br>When you greet a person, "Good Morning, sir",
    <br>your heart will say, "See him, very proud man. I said' 'Good Morning', and he refused to answer me".
    <br>You will greet, your heart will not greet.
    <br>We Christians, we take hold of our hearts in order to have accomplishments, results.
    <br>What you say - "Be healed!" - your heart must also release that word.
    <br>Not you saying it - your heart releases it.
    <br>As you are looking at me now, begin to meditate in your heart, don't allow your heart to be silent.
    <br>Because we Christians, we are not walking by sight, we walk by...
    <br>Do you know what the Bible calls faith? What is faith?
    <br>When you say you walk by faith, you mean you walk by heart.
    <br>If you are just going by your eyes, you will always have errors all the time.
    <br>But when you walk, you must walk by your heart.
    <br>The eyes of your heart must lead you.
    <br>As I am looking now, I am not only going by what I am seeing, but this heart is the one leading me.
    <br>The heart has eyes.
    <br>The Bible says, faith is of man's heart, meaning man's spirit.
    <br>So when you are sitting, you must also sit by your heart.
    <br>Anything that is not from your heart is a sin.
    <br>Your heart and your mouth must be in accord, in agreement.
    <br>If not, we would not be able to place you.
    <br>With our mouth we confess; with our heart we believe.
    <br>Salvation.
    <br>With our mouth we confess; with our heart we believe.
    <br>This is the life you must begin to live.
    <br>Are you engaging your heart now?
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You."
    <br>If somebody is even calling you, he must call all of you.
    <br>You are two natures in one person.
    <br>You and your divine.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You."
    <br>This is a prayer we anointed for you.
    <br>You may have your own prayer, no doubt about that but because of your weakness,
    <br>the Lord gave us a word that is easy for you to communicate.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You, Lord!"
    <br>"Your faithfulness, Your kindness, Your purity, Your holiness."
    <br>It's simply, just simple to communicate.
    <br>Begin to say that, engage your heart.
    <br>When you now engage your heart, you begin to have fulfillment, results.
    <br>We are like this because our heart, spirit is saying this,
    <br>our eyes are saing this.
    <br>You are seeing white and your heart is talking of a different thing.
    <br>You are greeting me, "Good Morning, Sir!",
    <br>and I say, "Thank you".
    <br>Your heart at the same time will say, "Why are you greeting Him?"
    <br>You will ask yourself, "Why am I greeting this man?
    <br>Well, I will greet him, he is my pastor".
    <br>That is our heart for you.
    <br>Your heart is always not agreeing, not in accordance with whatever you do.
    <br>So, arrest your heart.
    <br>Once you are able to get this, you begin to walk in line with God.
    <br>As I am talking to you, I am also at the same time praying.
    <br>How is it possible for a man to be preaching and at the same time praying?
    <br>Yes, it's possible because I have two natures.
    <br>Two persons in one person.
    <br>It's possible.
    <br>Until you begin to live this kind of life, you will overcome this world.
    <br>If not - a situation, where you say, "At 3pm, I am going to pray" -
    <br>you can never overcome this world.
    <br>Tomorrow I will fast - fasting must be every day.
    <br>The word "fasting" is abstaining from unrighteousness.
    <br>24/7 prayer.
    <br>Not when you enter the room, you say, "I want to pray, I want to fast".
    <br>These are the areas satan used to get you,
    <br>he knows, when you are not praying, he catches you.
    <br>Before you pray, he catches you.
    <br>He knows, when you pray, he will not be able to catch you.
    <br>He will make sure he catches you before you go to pray.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Are you communicating in the spirit?
    <br>That is what we call spirit prayer.
    <br>If a man is a Christian, you will know.
    <br>He doesn't talk too much because you are the only person talking.
    <br>If there is another talk in the spirit, you can't talk too much,
    <br>you will wait for the One that talks underneath.
    <br>You are calling me, "Hello, Sir", I will say "Hello, what do you want?" - I will wait for you.
    <br>I will never talk like that.
    <br>I will say, "Hello!" I will pause.
    <br>You think I don't hear what you are saying - I am praying underneath.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People say it is eloquent speech - "Hello, Jesus is Lord" because he is the only person talking.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord!" - at what time do you wait for the Holy Spirit to talk?
    <br>The One that controls you? Nobody controls you; you are the one talking.
    <br>You want to display the skill, what about the One that gives you the word?
    <br>Why can't you pause, hear from Him and say what He wants you to say?
    <br>So when you pick a phone, "Oh hello, sir!",
    <br>I am ready. I must hear from the One, my Controller what to say.
    <br>I must hear from my Commander what to say.
    <br>I must hear from my Instructor what to say.
    <br>- "Hello, sir."
    <br>- "Hello."
    <br>- "I just say, let me greet you."
    <br>- "Thank you."
    <br>At the same time, I am praying in the spirit.
    <br>- "Can you hear me, sir?"
    <br>- "I hear you quite alright."
    <br>You think, I don't hear you. I hear you - because I am not alone.
    <br>If I am not alone, I must hear from Him who sent me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You cannot continue serving God with physical strength, eloquent speech, your eyes or mouth.
    <br>You must serve Him with all your heart.
    <br>The first place we must grow or prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Let me share with you why it's so difficult for us,
    <br>after you have made a lot of money, you are rich, fleet of cars, companies, you have a lot -
    <br>yet there is a burden. Why?
    <br>It's like we are prospering in our financial life, material life and everything
    <br>but in our spiritual life - zero.
    <br>You have money, wealth, so much, you have people, yet there is so much burden.
    <br>Hardly you will be able to sleep, but you are not sick.
    <br>You need the help of drugs, tablets to sleep.
    <br>You cannot sit down any longer alone for 3 to 4 hours,
    <br>you need to be in the midst of people to be happy.
    <br>Created joy, joy that is created - not the joy of the Lord.
    <br>So, people will make you happy, you need go to party, club house, occasion, medical checkup,
    <br>you need to go for holiday every week just to be happy.
    <br>You are just looking for joy, the one you have is not sustaining you.
    <br>Now, reverse is the case - our spiritual life first
    <br>because this spiritual life is the one that carries everything we have.
    <br>It carries our money, property, fame; it is the spiritual life that carries them.
    <br>If something that carries you is very small, the weight will be too much for him.
    <br>The life many of us live is like you as a person carries this.
    <br>If you carry this, you will soon get tired.
    <br>Your spiritual life is like that.
    <br>What carries you is your spiritual life.
    <br>It's not your money, material, fame, popularity, wealth that carries you - no!!
    <br>What carries you, is your spiritual life.
    <br>And what you have is too much for your spiritual life to carry.
    <br>So your spiritual life is just...
    <br>That is why life is so difficult for many of us, with your money, property.
    <br>You keep asking yourself, "I have money. Why should I be suffering?
    <br>I have fame, companies all over the world. Why should I be suffering?"
    <br>Yes; because the person that is carrying you is carrying so much load, property
    <br>and he is the one who is supposed to be a giant and those things are supposed to be small.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want you to work on that.
    <br>God has given us a capacity to learn from our challenges.
    <br>So, if you don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>You don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.
    <br>What lesson will you learn from breakthrough?
    <br>What lesson will you learn from pleasure?
    <br>We learn much from challenges.
    <br>Your challenges could be sickness, poverty or temptation.
    <br>You don't want challenges, you don't want to learn.
    <br>You don't want to learn, you don't want to move forward.
    <br>Challenges will come; you will learn and move on.
    <br>You know the process of a seed growing.
    <br>When you plant seeds, you water them, you nurture them.
    <br>Why should you water seeds? Because of seasons - the dry season and rainy season.
    <br>You nurture them, you keep them away from insects, birds.
    <br>You try to remove weeds around it.
    <br>These are the challenges seeds have, before they grow and become beneficial to you.
    <br>In the same vein, you are a seed growing.
    <br>If your faith is lifted up, let me see your hand.
    <br>I would like to ask you a question before I leave you.
    <br>And I want somebody from the heart to answer this question.
    <br>How does this message appeal to you?
    <br>Don't rely on yourself but on the Holy Spirit
    <br>because the burden will arrive, challenges will come.
    <br>If you rely on yourself, you will not hold it, stand it or maintain it.
    <br>But with the Holy Spirit, you will go forward.
    <br>You need challenges to learn and to move forward.
    <br>What are the challenges we are talking about?
    <br>Problems of life.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Clap for her!
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>She said we need challenges.
    <br>There are some challenges you cause by yourself.
    <br>When you cause a challenge and it comes, God will withdraw His strength for you to face it.
    <br>You decide to look for sugar, eat ice cream, eat sugar,
    <br>and you say you like the food.
    <br>What will you expect? (Diabetes)
    <br>And when it comes, you will face it on your own.
    <br>God will withdraw His strength from you to face the diabetes.
    <br>Without God, you will be defeated, destroyed, you will die.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I have learnt today from our Prophet TB Joshua that
    <br>being a human being, we must pass through some challenges
    <br>because before gold must be gold, it has to pass through fire.
    <br>So, before a Christian is a real, true born-again Christian, he must pass through some challenges.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brother, can you just give us more, what challenges are you going through now?
    <br>The challenges can be sickness...
    <br>I say, you.
    <br>Just tell us one of the challenges because everyone here has 1, 2 or 3.
    <br>Family challenges.
    <br>That is disunity.
    <br>So that is it - which is common.
    <br>The question now is: if you are not the cause -
    <br>because some of us, this issue of family, we are the cause.
    <br>We caused it and when we caused it in that sense,
    <br>God sometimes withdraws His power and leaves us to face it.
    <br>So, thank you, brother; thank you very much.
    <br>God bless you.
