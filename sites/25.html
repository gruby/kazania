    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There's a home you newly want to enter.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Why did you leave where you are coming from?
    <br>I left because I believe I need deliverance.
    <br>Because it is like the person is hiding something from me.
    <br>Because he's not honest.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You discovered that he has someone
    <br>that he has married with.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>What did you not discover this at the beginning?
    <br>There was a photo you saw at the beginning.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>A light in complexion woman - short.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.

    <br>Go and wait for me. I will see you.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Charlene Mutongi
    <br>Zimbabwe
    <br>The man of God came to me and said, "You are about to enter a new home
    <br>and you left the man - why?"
    <br>I tried to explain that every man that I had a relationship with, it seemed as if
    <br>they were hiding something from me.
    <br>The man of God said, "It's because the man is not honest. And I said, "Yes".
    <br>And then the man of God said, you saw a picture of a light, short lady.
    <br>And I said, "Yes". And he said, when you saw that picture, why didn't you leave the marriage?
    <br>There's a home you newly want to enter.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Why did you leave where you are coming from?
    <br>I left because I believe I need deliverance.
    <br>Because it is like the person is hiding something from me.
    <br>Because he is not honest.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You discovered that he has someone
    <br>that he has married with.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Why did you not discover this at the beginning?
    <br>There was a photo you saw at the beginning.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>A light in complexion woman - short.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Receives Prophecy From Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>It is true because I saw the picture. I asked the guy and he said it was a friend.
    <br>I continued the relationship with him and later on he proposed marriage and I accepted.
    <br>I discovered that he was not the man from Heaven.
    <br>I had to seek the face of the Lord first. That's why I decided to come here.
    <br>What decision did you take about that relationship?
    <br>I decided to leave the man and come to The SCOAN to seek the face of the Lord
    <br>so that I could get delivered first and see whether I could get married now
    <br>or continue my career, my calling first before I get into marriage.
    <br>We were about to get married but I discovered that I could not get married to him because of his dishonesty.
    <br>There was something he was hiding from me but he wasn't telling me.
    <br>I saw that photo and I thought I couldn't get
    <br>married to him because I could get myself in trouble.
    <br>The man of God said you are about to move to a new house, is that right?
    <br>He said I wanted to move to a new place.
    <br>Yes, I've thought about it and I need to do something else with my life, not marriage.
    <br>There was a photo you saw at the beginning.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>A light in complexion woman - short.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Yes, it is true. The woman is short and light in complexion.
    <br>Were you not surprised that the Man of God was able to identify the exact stature and colour of that woman?
    <br>I wasn't surprised because I believe he is a true man of God and I've seen
    <br>many things he has been doing, so I just take it as it is.
    <br>Do you believe this word of prophecy has brought direction, instruction, revelation and breakthrough to your life?
    <br>Yes, I believe, 100 per cent.
    <br>We thank God for this word of prophecy and we want to encourage you to continue to stay close to Jesus Christ
    <br>and He will surely guide you and direct you to the next steps, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Madam, we want to find out from you more about what you are doing for a living, what is your career?
    <br>I am a model. I started modelling when I was very young, at the age of seven.
    <br>I was crowned with 27 titles.
    <br>The biggest title I was given was Miss Tourism Zimbabwe, Mashonaland East.
    <br>I was a regional winner. This is the sash.
    <br>Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Receives Prophecy From Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>You said that you have 27 titles in your modelling career, is that correct?
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>That is wonderful. Can you say more about the sash you currently wear?
    <br>The sash I am currently wearing is to be an ambassador for my province, Mashonaland East.
    <br>I was crowned when I went for Miss Tourism Zimbabwe.
    <br>That was when I was crowned a regional winner.
    <br>At first, I contested for Miss Tourism Marondora and I was crowned as Miss Tourism Marondora, representing my town.
    <br>Then, when I went for Miss Tourism Zimbabwe,
    <br>that was when they crowned me the regional winner, 2008/2009,
    <br>Miss Tourism Mashonaland East.
    <br>We thank God for this success in your career
    <br>and as you're here now to seek the face of God - what do you want to seek the face of God about concerning your career?
    <br>I would like to ask God if I can still pursue my modelling career
    <br>because I have seen how he has been helping people, like Commander,
    <br>the wrestler, the footballers and Sechaba, the musician.
    <br>So, I decided to come here.
    <br>I know, by the grace of God, I will have something in my life and I will do my best and the best is yet to come.
    <br>Hallelujah. Tell us, as an ambassador in your country, what you are doing to assist the less privileged in your country?
    <br>I formed an organisation, an NGO, when I was 15.
    <br>It is called Silver Jubilee Trust Fund - it's an NGO which is helping
    <br>the orphans, the vulnerable children, the disabled, the fatherless, the hopeless,
    <br>the widows, widowers and the lonely.
    <br>I have been helping a children's home.
    <br>We also help different people from our community. We identify and help them if they are in need.
    <br>That is wonderful, and the things you saw on Emmanuel TV of how Prophet T.B. Joshua is helping the less privileged,
    <br>did that really inspire you in that pursuit?
    <br>Yes, it has really inspired me. He has been my mentor in giving.
    <br>I have seen how he has been giving to the less-privileged, vulnerable children, the widows and widowers.
    <br>So, I decided to come here to receive counselling
    <br>so that I will be able to do my charity work in the way of the Lord.
    <br>Glory be to God. We thank God for the prophecy you received today
    <br>and we believe God Almighty will crown your efforts with success as you pursue His will in your life
    <br>and your career as a professional model.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free and delivered.
