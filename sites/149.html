    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Here are Mr and Mrs Hans Baksteen -
    <br>visitors from Holland who are here in The 
    <br>Synagogue Church Of All Nations in Lagos Nigeria,
    <br>seeking for the fruit of the womb 
    <br>from God Almighty.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Baksteen
    <br>This is a document from the Minister of Justice in Holland
    <br>registering their application for adoption of a child.
    <br>This proves they have given up all hope of having their own child.
    <br>But today, they are returning to Jesus Christ, the Giver of life.
    <br>You are welcome to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Tell us your name and the country you come from.
    <br>My name is Josein Baksteen, I'm 31 years old and I'm from Holland.
    <br>Who is the man sitting next to you?
    <br>The man sitting next to me is my husband.
    <br>And the problem that brought me to the Synagogue
    <br>is the problem of looking for the fruit of the womb.
    <br>I went twice through some surgery and
    <br> they did some research.
    <br>They found out that there was a problem but were unable to specify what the problem was.
    <br>There was a problem which did not allow me to conceive.
    <br>My husband is having a problem of low sperm count.
    <br>That is why the combination of our problems makes it very difficult for us to have a baby.
    <br>This is my second visit and on the first visit, I discussed it with the prophet.
    <br>I told him that we were in the process of adopting, which had taken three years.
    <br>He advised me not to continue with the adoption and to bring my husband,
    <br>that we would have our own baby.
    <br>Let's hear from your husband.
    <br>My name is Hans Baksteen.
    <br>The woman beside me is my wife.
    <br>I'm in The SCOAN today because we are in need of the fruit of the womb.
    <br>My wife went to several hospitals and had some surgeries
    <br>in an attempt to fall pregnant but found no solution.
    <br>When we found out that there was no medical solution,
    <br>then we started the process of adoption.
    <br>Here you can see the permission given to adopt a baby from the Ministry of Justice.
    <br>It is an official permit to adopt a baby from another country.
    <br>We were intending to adopt a child from Ethiopia.
    <br>Is this why you came here today?
    <br>This is why I'm here because I believe that God is able to solve this problem for us
    <br>and that He can give us a baby.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>This is the emergency section of The SCOAN
    <br>where visitors from all over the world have come
    <br>to receive a touch from our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
    <br>through His able servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Among them are Mr and Mrs Baksteen.
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua stretching forth this hand
    <br>to command out everything that is not of Jesus,
    <br>and to replace it with what is of Jesus.
    <br>It is God's desire for everyone to be restored to full and abundant life.
    <br>Jesus Christ is now shaking the obstacle of the problem they have faced for so long.
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>In Your holy name
    <br>You are free today, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Time with Jesus is time with joy
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua assures them that their blessing is not far from them.
    <br>They now have something to shout "Hallelujah!" about.
    <br>A few months later, Mr and Mrs Baksteen came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify that Mrs Baksteen is now pregnant.
    <br>To God be the Glory!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Jesus Christ says what He means and He means what He says.
    <br>When He says you are blessed, you are blessed indeed.
    <br>Hans and Josein have come singing and dancing back into The Synagogue,
    <br>showing the blessing of God in their lives.
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Hans and Josein Baksteen.
    <br>We are from Holland and the problem that brought us to The SCOAN
    <br>was low sperm count and fruit of the womb.
    <br>We came to Nigeria and last March Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for us.
    <br>Then we went back to Holland and we met as husband and wife.
    <br>And after that my wife became pregnant
    <br>Now, you can see her - she is seven and a half months pregnant.
    <br>Praise the Lord for that!
    <br>Our advice to all people who are looking for the fruit of the womb is:
    <br>Trust in the Lord and be patient and what He did for us, He can also do for you.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Josein Baksteen.
    <br>I'm all the way from Holland.
    <br>And as you can see I'm pregnant now.
    <br>Here I am standing in front of you for the glory of God,
    <br>telling you that I'm pregnant and I'm very very happy.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>A few months later, Mr And Mrs Hans Baksteen came back to The SCOAN
    <br>with their bouncing baby to testify to the goodness of God in their lives.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Baksteen Arriving At The SCOAN With Their Baby
    <br>Mr and Mrs Baksteen are back to The SCOAN with their child
    <br>which is definitely something to be happy about.
    <br>Glory be to God, they have received from Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Baksteen Arriving At The SCOAN With Their Baby
    <br>Mr and Mrs Hans Baksteen, the blessed parents, are now walking
    <br>in the midst of the people of God with their newborn baby
    <br>to testify that God knows every need you face and He is ready to supply them.
    <br>So, just believe!
    <br>Mr & Mrs Baksteen
    <br>Enter The SCOAN Rejoicing
    <br>They Sit In The Midst Of Other Mothers Blessed With Miracle Babies
    <br>My name is Josein Baksteen.
    <br>I'm from Holland.
    <br>My baby's name is Promise Baksteen.
    <br>The man sitting next to me is my husband Hans Baksteen.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, I was very surprised seeing all these miracle babies.
    <br>I wasn't even thinking about having another baby anymore
    <br>because we had waited for such a long time.
    <br>I became very happy because I thought if God can do this for these people,
    <br>He can surely do it for us.
    <br>We were in the process of adopting a baby which is a very long process.
    <br>It takes five years to adopt a baby and we were in this process for three years.
    <br>We had all the official papers ready.
    <br>The Prophet prayed over the problems of fruit of the womb and low sperm count.
    <br>He prayed over our problems and we went back home.
    <br>We met as husband and wife and after a while, I became pregnant.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>While I was seven months pregnant, I visited The SCOAN.
    <br>The prophet said, "You will deliver a baby girl and her name will be Promise."
    <br>That was a real promise of God.
    <br>As you can see, we have a bouncing baby girl.
    <br>Her name is Promise, and we are very very happy.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>We thank the Lord for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>He is good, He is so good.
    <br>My name is Hans Baksteen.
    <br>I'm the husband of Josein who is sitting beside me.
    <br>The name of the baby is Promise Joy Illeri Oluwa.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Baksteen With Their Baby Promise
    <br>Her name means "Promise of God".
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was the problem of barrenness.
    <br>The problem on my part was low sperm count.
    <br>Last year March, I was invited to come with my wife to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed over our problems.
    <br>After that, we went home and met as husband and wife.
    <br>My wife got pregnant.
    <br>After nine months, she delivered a beautiful bouncing
    <br> baby girl named Promise of God.
    <br>We thank God for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>Our advice to couples who are also looking for the fruit of the womb
    <br>is to trust God because He can also do for you what He has done for us.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Baksteen With Their Baby Promise
    <br>Baby Promise Crawling At The SCOAN
    <br>Baby Promise, Now Walking,
    <br>Returns To The SCOAN
    <br>This is Promise Baksteen.
    <br>She's growing stronger day by day and is now walking.
    <br>Promise is very happy to be back in The SCOAN today.
    <br>She has come with her parents to give God all the glory.
    <br>Baby Promise, Now Walking,
    <br>Returns To The SCOAN
