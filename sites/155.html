    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Here is the prayer line section of the SCOAN, where God's Spirit is the force behind His Word.
    <br>God's service is more than mere preaching or teaching but it is of power.
    <br>As wise man Christopher moves with the force of God, he sees the manifestation of the evil spirit
    <br>in the life of this lady.
    <br>Watch how the evil spirit, which made her to be winding around is conquered in Jesus' name.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You demon.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Why are you asking me again?
    <br>I told you before.
    <br>I'm the curse of the family.
    <br>That is number one.
    <br>Who is number two?
    <br>The idol.
    <br>Who is number three?
    <br>A snake.
    <br>Who is number four?
    <br>Her husband.
    <br>As a snake, what have you done to this lady?
    <br>I destroyed her career.
    <br>What have you done to the family members?
    <br>I have no business with the family.
    <br>Why do you choose to destroy her?
    <br>She is supposed to be a nurse.
    <br>For what?
    <br>That was why I cancelled her results.
    <br>She can't read.
    <br>Whenever she wants to read I would just go on her head and sit down.
    <br>She can't read.
    <br>When you sit on her head what will happen?
    <br>She can't read.
    <br>If she reads she'll forget.
    <br>She will be lazy. She will complain that she can't read.
    <br>As an idol, what have you done to her?
    <br>They are supposed to serve me.
    <br>What have you done to them?
    <br>I caused them bad luck.
    <br>What is happening to them?
    <br>To their careers and marriages?
    <br>Marriage? They are moving in circles.
    <br>Who is the cause?
    <br>The idol from the father's side and from the mother's side.
    <br>Open your eyes.
    <br>Look at these people.
    <br>Look at the first lady.
    <br>Look at her.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>They are parts of the bad luck.
    <br>Speak louder.
    <br>They are parts of the bad luck.
    <br>Look at the next lady.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>This one is a curse to the family.
    <br>We sent her to come and destroy the family.
    <br>Who, which one?
    <br>This one.
    <br>She is an agent.
    <br>We sent her to destroy the family.
    <br>We turned her in the womb; the idol of the family.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>She is my younger sister.
    <br>She is my older sister.
    <br>Did you hear that?
    <br>They are all bad luck; they won't get married.
    <br>Bride price – no.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ask her; the other sister, she's somewhere.
    <br>We don't know.
    <br>We just sent her out of the house.
    <br>She has two kids but no bride price.
    <br>Yes, it's true.
    <br>What can you say about her?
    <br>My older sister is a doctor by profession and she has two children by a guy and he did not pay the dowry.
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>She fights with the mum.
    <br>She will call the mum witch.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Who is the cause?
    <br>The curse.
    <br>This is my older sister.
    <br>This is the one who got married.
    <br>She has two kids but no bride price.
    <br>Is she the one you are talking about?
    <br>Which one?
    <br>This one has two kids?
    <br>She has two kids but no bride price.
    <br>This one got married five months ago and she came back.
    <br>Yes, the curse.
    <br>I was sent on an errand; I don't know.
    <br>I was just asked to follow her.
    <br>How did you enter this lady?
    <br>Right from when she was born.
    <br>What she is saying is true.
    <br>We school in Delta State University.
    <br>Both of us are in the same hostel.
    <br>Each time I tell her about suitors that come to me, before you know it, they will just run away.
    <br>Anything you tell her, the thing will not come to pass.
    <br>She is very secretive and does not tell anyone anything about herself.
    <br>I want to go.
    <br>What is in this place that is against you demons?
    <br>Fire.
    <br>How many demonic powers do you have in this body?
    <br>I told you before, just four.
    <br>Right now, your mission has come to an end.
    <br>This is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Get out.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Now, move like a snake.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Come back here.
    <br>Move like a snake.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Now, get out.
    <br>Come out of her, you demon!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Remove the rings.
    <br>Remove them!
    <br>What are you removing?
    <br>Rings.
    <br>Speak louder - what are you removing?
    <br>Rings.
    <br>From your head to your toe - everything that belongs to you - remove it.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You are delivered.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Can you remember what you said?
    <br>Not really; I know I said something but I can't recall.
    <br>You said that you were a snake with another four demons in your body.
    <br>No.
    <br>This is your sister?
    <br>Yes, my older sister.
    <br>This is your younger sister?
    <br>My younger one next to me; yes.
    <br>Her past is over; so, glory be to God, she's completely delivered.
    <br>She's a new creation.
    <br>Old things pass away.
    <br>Nobody should use what she had said against her.
    <br>That demonic being that spoke was cast out by Jesus and now, she is free.
    <br>If you say what she has said or use it against her, you will be tempted.
    <br>We pray that you will not be tempted, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My sister is free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm free!
    <br>All over your body – fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am from the water.
    <br>What is your mission?
    <br>To monitor the family.
    <br>What have you done to the family so far?
    <br>No marriage; suitors come and go.
    <br>No good luck; quarrel everywhere.
    <br>What have you done to this lady?
    <br>She's very bright.
    <br>I have destroyed her.
    <br>No good people come her way.
    <br>She travels a lot.
    <br>She followed friends.
    <br>How did you enter her body?
    <br>When she was born.
    <br>Her mother threw away her placenta in the river.
    <br>What is your business with the placenta?
    <br>This is what we use against her.
    <br>Ever since you used it what has been happening to her?
    <br>She's rude, she's stubborn, she doesn’t hear.
    <br>Anything you tell her; nothing.
    <br>All what she wants is to do what she wants to do.
    <br>Who made her to be so?
    <br>Me.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because I love her.
    <br>This is not a place you can live.
    <br>This is the temple of the Spirit of God.
    <br>Open you eyes!
    <br>Look at these people.
    <br>Who are they to you?
    <br>I don’t know them.
    <br>Look at this one.
    <br>I don’t know her.
    <br>Look at this one.
    <br>I don’t know.
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>She is my younger sister.
    <br>She is very stubborn.
    <br>She doesn’t even go to school.
    <br>She is very "insultive", aggressive; she doesn’t have respect for anybody, even towards my mum and dad.
    <br>She fights with my mum.
    <br>She goes to clubs and follows friends.
    <br>She goes to clubs every day from Monday to Sunday.
    <br>She doesn’t stay at home.
    <br>All of her body is full with tattoos.
    <br>She has them on her waist, her breast – all over her body are tattoos.
    <br>What can you say about her?
    <br>Everything my sister said.
    <br>Most of the injuries on my body - she gave them to me.
    <br>Most of the injuries you have, she gave them to you?
    <br>Whenever she's angry she'll bring bottles or knives, anything in her hand.
    <br>She may even break the table in the sitting room.
    <br>Who made her to possess this kind of attitude?
    <br>From the water.
    <br>Since you are a stranger, get out.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost Fire!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of this body, you demon.
    <br>Now go.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus' name, Amen.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Open your eyes and look at these people.
    <br>Who is this lady to you?
    <br>My older sister.
    <br>This is your sister and this is your sister.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Her past is over.
    <br>Do not use what she has confessed in the past against her.
    <br>Otherwise, everybody here will be tempted.
    <br>She is free; you too are free.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! We are delivered!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Sophia.
    <br>I am 21 years old and I am from Delta, Nigeria.
    <br>The lady standing beside me is my sister.
    <br>The problem that brought me to the SCOAN started when I was growing up, at the tender age of six;
    <br>I started seeing a man coming to make love to me in my dreams.
    <br>I would see myself as a fish in the water and eating with people in my dreams.
    <br>As I was growing up, the problem became worse.
    <br>I would see myself as a princess, doing my hair in the water in my dreams.
    <br>When I was in secondary school, I wanted to write an exam but my parents couldn't afford it.
    <br>I decided to go into a relationship.
    <br>When I would go into relationships, they wouldn't work out.
    <br>The man would say that I appeared to them as a snake and chased them or fight with them
    <br>as a mermaid in their dreams.
    <br>As a result, I started going to churches, looking for deliverance.
    <br>I went to several churches.
    <br>I went to a spiritualist and I was told I suffered from a spiritual husband and that I should go
    <br>and serve the spiritual husband.
    <br>The spiritualist told me to do a concoction.
    <br>After he did the concoction for me, the same night, the spiritual husband came again.
    <br>He came back with two men; it was worse.
    <br>From there, I went to different places and started meeting different spiritualists.
    <br>One spiritualist called me and told me that most girls don't make it just like that,
    <br>that they used to give them something, in order to make it.
    <br>The spiritualist called me inside his office and said he was going to give me something to wear on my eyes,
    <br>to rub on my lips and all over my body; he said that anything I would tell a man, he would do it for me.
    <br>The spiritualist gave it to me; I rubbed it on my lips, eyes and all over my body.
    <br>As soon as I walked past any man in that area, he would want to go out with me.
    <br>That was how I was doing it.
    <br>It came to a time where it became worse.
    <br>I started going to the clubs, moving with different people because the urge I had for men was much.
    <br>I had an encounter with someone and I was arrested; I slept in the prison cell for three days.
    <br>The first night, something entered me.
    <br>I was so strong; I could talk to the policeman any way I liked and I would fight with them.
    <br>Ever since I left the police station, it became worse.
    <br>I started stealing.
    <br>How would you go about using these charms that the spiritualist gave you to attract men
    <br>and in the same way also steal from them?
    <br>The one in my eyes, whenever I used it, I would look directly into their eyes,
    <br>blink my eyes and push out my lips.
    <br>The next thing was that they would say I had sexy eyes.
    <br>That meant they had already fallen for the charm.
    <br>We would go to the hotel and after the encounter,
    <br>I would deceive them and tell them to go downstairs to get something.
    <br>The spirit would tell me where the money was; when I would look at the room, I would know the place.
    <br>I would collect their money, their phones and leave.
    <br>I would dress very well so nobody would ask me any questions.
    <br>That was what I would normally do.
    <br>The men that invite you to meet them in the hotel - after meeting them, as they are not there,
    <br>you would now steal their money and you would know where the money was kept?
    <br>That spirit would tell you where the money were kept?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Even some of them, I would lock them in the bathroom, increase the volume on the television and leave.
    <br>That was what I was doing.
    <br>We understand what our sister is saying.
    <br>After meeting with the man she would lock him in the bathroom, then increase the volume of the television
    <br>and then steal his money.
    <br>What were you using such money for?
    <br>I would use the money to buy clothes and things.
    <br>I would keep the money somewhere and would go to collect it but the money would vanish.
    <br>Even when I'd lay out my clothes, the next morning, I would not find them there.
    <br>During this period, that was how you were getting money; by meeting these men,
    <br>stealing from them and sleeping with them.
    <br>Is that right?
    <br>Yes, that was it.
    <br>Can you just explain more about how this problem really affected not only yourself but the whole family?
    <br>The evil spirit affected my family so much.
    <br>Sometimes after stealing, people would know that I had stolen from them
    <br>and would then come to my house to tell my family what I had done.
    <br>I would deny it.
    <br>I was very quiet in my house, so my mum would always fight for me that I hadn't done anything.
    <br>Even your parents did not know what you were doing?
    <br>Yes, because I was very quiet in the house.
    <br>Tell us what was your behavior in the house when you were with your parents
    <br>compared to you behavior outside.
    <br>When I was in my house, I would be very quiet, obedient and very good
    <br>but whenever I was outside, the evil spirit would enter me and I’d misbehave.
    <br>You said that you were going to clubs.
    <br>What would you do, when you were in clubs, to attract men that you would be able to sleep with them?
    <br>When I'd go to the clubs, I'd put the charm on my lips, eyes and all over my body.
    <br>Any man that would walk past would say he wanted to go out with me.
    <br>We would then discuss how much he would pay me for the night.
    <br>That was what I was doing.
    <br>The evil spirit affected me badly.
    <br>The spirit of stealing was so terrible because I would be tempted.
    <br>After spending 20 000 naira, I would steal something that cost 50 naira.
    <br>It was very bad.
    <br>Sometime last year, my senior sister came to the SCOAN.
    <br>In my house, we couldn’t get married; that was the problem everyone was facing in the family.
    <br>My senior sister came to the SCOAN and received the Anointing Water.
    <br>When I got home, my mum said I should minister the Anointing Water.
    <br>I ministered the Anointing Water and I manifested.
    <br>Then I came to The SCOAN for my deliverance.
    <br>Let's put our hands for Jesus Christ!
    <br>When I came to the SCOAN, I was sitting far towards the back but when the wise man Christopher was close,
    <br>I started running away.
    <br>They brought me back twice and he prayed for me.
    <br>The spirit that was inside of me left.
    <br>Glory by to God Almighty.
    <br>Tell us - ever since your deliverance - what is your testimony now?
    <br>What changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>I have seen a lot of changes.
    <br>Before when the spirit would enter me, I'd take my things and leave the house.
    <br>When I slept, I saw three snakes leaving my body.
    <br>I know I am delivered; I am calm.
    <br>You mean that after your deliverance you had a dream - what happened in that dream?
    <br>I saw three snakes – two big ones, a green one and a tiny one.
    <br>They all came out of my body – I killed two and chased the other one.
    <br>It went inside the bush.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is the confirmation of the deliverance she received.
    <br>Sister, you said before that you were stealing, lying, meeting men and using the powers that you obtained
    <br>from the witch doctor to seduce and attract men.
    <br>Ever since your deliverance, what can you say now about those areas?
    <br>Do you still have that spirit pushing you to steal, lie, meet with men?
    <br>No. I am free.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>We thank Jesus Christ for your life.
    <br>I think you are in a wonderful position to advise young people around the world.
    <br>You are a young lady, you are only 21 years old.
    <br>With your experiences in life; all the time before - with those evil spirits, and now when you are delivered,
    <br>what do you want to advise young people around the world watching you right now on Emmanuel TV?
    <br>My advice is to tell people that there is nothing in the world.
    <br>Everything belongs to God, so they should come to God, pray to God because He answers prayers.
    <br>Definitely, He will answer them.
    <br>It is just a matter of being patient.
    <br>How did this affect your education, when you were living this kind of a life-style?
    <br>It affected my education badly.
    <br>I wrote an exam four years ago and when I went to collect the results,
    <br>I was told that the results were
    <br>As a result, I could not gain admission.
    <br>I was doing a programme and I was sleeping with men to pay my school fees.
    <br>But still, I could not study in school, I hated school and couldn’t go any longer.
    <br>Even the courses I paid for, I would pay people to write them and then, I paid the lecturer,
    <br>but I would still have a carry-over.
    <br>That was the problem I was facing in school.
    <br>Right now, we want to hear from your sister as well, who was also privileged to receive a mighty deliverance,
    <br>alongside you, the day she came.
    <br>Sister, you're welcome.
    <br>Tell us your name, and where you are from.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Faith, I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am 18 years old.
    <br>The problems that brought me to the SCOAN were a family curse and a spiritual husband.
    <br>When I was small, I was stubborn; anything you would tell me to do, I wouldn't do it.
    <br>Whatever was in my mind, that was what I would do.
    <br>I would fight.
    <br>My friends couldn’t fight because if they did, I'd do something crazy to them before I would get myself.
    <br>There was a day I woke up and left to see a friend.
    <br>That day, my friend started introducing me to men.
    <br>She said I should come with her, that in my house there was no money, and that we were suffering;
    <br>I should come and sleep with men, so I'd have money to take care of myself.
    <br>How old were you when you started this?
    <br>I was 14 years old.
    <br>She started introducing me to men and I would sleep with them for money.
    <br>The men would give me money.
    <br>As time went on, she would take me to different men; sometimes, we would go out to the clubs.
    <br>When we'd get to the clubs, men would ask me how much for the night.
    <br>I'd tell them to bring a certain amount of money and I'd go with them.
    <br>As time went on, my friend said that we weren't making good money, that we should go to a spiritualist,
    <br>so they could help us get more money.
    <br>She took me to a spiritualist and he gave me something to use.
    <br>He said that the spiritual husband was causing me to have bad luck.
    <br>He gave me a charm that anywhere I'd go, men would give me anything I asked for.
    <br>He put the charm on my forehead and on my lips.
    <br>Whenever I went anywhere, if we were 10 in number, I would be the first person a man would talk to.
    <br>He would tell me that I was beautiful and ask for my number.
    <br>From there, we were sleeping with men.
    <br>I travelled to different cities to meet men.
    <br>She introduced me to friends who said I had to join a cult before I could be friends with them.
    <br>I said I couldn’t do that but they told me that I had to or I had to stop going out with them.
    <br>I needed money and I liked clubbing.
    <br>Most times I slept with men, I would ask why I had done it but I wouldn't know I was doing it.
    <br>Afterwards, I'd get myself and I knew I had done something bad.
    <br>I would start crying.
    <br>My friend would ask me if I was crazy, why was I crying, that I was crying like a baby;
    <br>she said she would push me out.
    <br>I would find the strength to stay with them.
    <br>You said that your friends had told you to join a cult.
    <br>Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What happened during this initiation?
    <br>For the initiation, there was a procedure.
    <br>The man would sleep with you and afterwards, they would beat you.
    <br>Then, you are initiated.
    <br>Others had to pay money.
    <br>As for myself, I didn’t want any mark on my body, so I paid them the money.
    <br>They told me that anything I saw there, I could not say outside and they cut my hand
    <br>and I took an oath with my blood.
    <br>What did they ask you to do show that you are a part of that cult?
    <br>In the cult, the girls were tough.
    <br>They drew a tattoo on my arm with the name they gave me.
    <br>They told you that you should put this tattoo to show that you are a part of that cult?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How old were you when you joined this cult?
    <br>I was 16 years old.
    <br>16 years old.
    <br>Do you mean to say that there are other tattoos on your body as well?
    <br>Yes. The other tattoo is of a dollar sign.
    <br>If I wanted, I could get any tattoo I liked, so I got this one of a dollar sign.
    <br>Your sister is saying that when she joined that cult she was told to wear a tattoo and they gave her the name
    <br>of Arsa, which was tattooed on her body.
    <br>They also said, "if you want any other tattoo, you can".
    <br>She chose to make a sign of a dollar, sign of money as a tattoo on her body.
    <br>Tell us, why did you choose this tattoo of a dollar sign?
    <br>Why did you choose to make a tattoo with money sign on your body?
    <br>When I was in the streets, no relationship would ever work out.
    <br>I decided that all I needed in life was money.
    <br>With money, you are OK.
    <br>So the dollar sign was for money.
    <br>You believed that as long as you could get money you'd be OK.
    <br>Everything about you was just to get money, meet men, sleep with them and get money.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Tell us, what for you would be using such money.
    <br>Would you use it for anything profitable?
    <br>We would use the money to get drinks in the clubs, buy clothes and travel to the best places to enjoy ourselves.
    <br>You were never actually able to use the money for anything really profitable.
    <br>You would just use it for drinking, smoking, buying clothes and then the money would go.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In the course of meeting men, what other things did you begin to do to such men
    <br>in order to obtain money from them?
    <br>There was a day I walked up to a man and I saw money on his table; the evil spirit in me to take the money.
    <br>Since the day I collected money from that man, I started collecting money from men.
    <br>There was no way they would drop money and I wouldn’t know it was there.
    <br>I would go there and take the money.
    <br>My friends would say that there was money missing.
    <br>They couldn’t believe that I was the one taking the money; I looked too innocent.
    <br>They would start accusing someone else.
    <br>After sleeping with a men, they would pay you and you would also steal money from them?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And they never suspected that you were the one who stole the money.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Tell us, as you were continuing this kind of life-style...
    <br>You mean to say that you left your home at the age of 14?
    <br>Yes, I left home.
    <br>They were looking for me but I didn’t give them my address of where I was staying.
    <br>Right from the age of 14 you'd left your house and were moving around, sleeping with men to get money
    <br>and moving out with friends?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Each time you go to the club - what do you do to attract men, that they would meet with you?
    <br>I know how to dance very well.
    <br>When I started dancing in the club, men would be fighting to be with me.
    <br>Tell us, did you also have any experiences in this course of prostitution that you would never forget?
    <br>Maybe you encountered a man that wanted to do something to you?
    <br>Like your sister said earlier - in terms of rituals?
    <br>What kind of encounters did you have during that period?
    <br>Yes, I had an encounter I will never forget.
    <br>There was a day three of my friends were called and told to come with girls and I was one of them.
    <br>We were in a vehicle and the next thing, I found myself in the forest.
    <br>We were all naked, wearing only our panties and bras.
    <br>They tied our hair and priced each of our heads at 500 000 naira.
    <br>I thought I was going to die that day and prayed that God should forgive my sin.
    <br>I was just praying.
    <br>When I got back, my mum said that same night she had a dream that they wanted to kill me;
    <br>she was even praying.
    <br>I just prayed.
    <br>The men were huge.
    <br>There were human heads, babies, school bags, uniforms; everything was there.
    <br>The girl that brought us in the vehicle told us that our heads were not good,
    <br>that we just caused them bad luck.
    <br>After 12 o'clock in the night, we were running through the forest; it was raining.
    <br>That was how we escaped.
    <br>The women at the market gave us clothes to cover ourselves as we travelled back.T
    <br>This is a kind of experience you had as a prostitute.
    <br>Have you ever had a similar encounter with a man in the hotel?
    <br>I had an encounter with a man who said he was a pastor.
    <br>He told me I looked beautiful, that I was nice and that I was going to do a job for him.
    <br>He said he was a pastor, that he had a programme where he would preach and see visions.
    <br>He introduced me to some girls who worked with him.
    <br>He would tell me what to do.
    <br>We would go to the church and the girls would take me close to men who had money.
    <br>I would talk to the man, collect his phone number and name.
    <br>I would tell them about the man.
    <br>The 'pastor' would go to the programme and ask of that man.
    <br>He would tell him to come out and tell his phone number.
    <br>He would make a huge amount of money from the man.
    <br>That was the plan that that man who claimed to be a pastor had with you, that you would come to the church
    <br>befriend someone there, collect their details, give them to that man, and then in public he would supposedly
    <br>prophesy about it in order to get money from that man.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In the process of doing that work for him, he travelled out of the country.
    <br>When he came back, I told him I wasn't around; he said he'd find someone else.
    <br>Have you ever tried to stop this kind of life-style before your coming to the Synagogue?
    <br>Yes, I tried to stop but there was no way.
    <br>When I would stop, I would bring my things back to the house but things were not OK.
    <br>There was no money.
    <br>The evil spirit would be asking me what I was still doing there, that I was hungry and had nothing to wear;
    <br>I would go back to the streets.
    <br>OK, we can really understand from our sister what has been happening in her life.
    <br>This is what she has passed through.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that you are here today with your sister as a testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>Tell us, what happened when you came here to the SCOAN with your sister.
    <br>Last year in November, my senior sister came to the SCOAN she received the Anointing Water
    <br>and brought it home.
    <br>She said that everybody should minister the Anointing Water to themselves.
    <br>When I ministered the Anointing Water to myself, I was dizzy and stood up.
    <br>My friends would come and call me to go out but I would tell them I didn't want to go.
    <br>Most times when I would dream, I would see pastors telling me that this wasn't the way for me to enjoy life.
    <br>I decided to come to the SCOAN.
    <br>When coming to the SCOAN every way was blocked; since December, we were planning on coming here
    <br>but there was no money.
    <br>I couldn’t go anywhere; there was no money.
    <br>After December, the New Year period, I said we must come to the SCOAN.
    <br>At the prayer line, my sister was delivered.
    <br>When the wise man moved closer to me, there was fire all over him; I couldn't look at him.
    <br>I was not myself, until I stood up from the floor.
    <br>Tell us sister, ever since your deliverance - what is your testimony?
    <br>How is your live changed?
    <br>My life is OK.
    <br>I can see things and no longer have interest in taking them.
    <br>I am OK.
    <br>My friends would call and ask me where I was and I would tell them not to call my number anymore,
    <br>that I'm not into that.
    <br>My friends said that for me to change, she too would change, that she was going to come to the SCOAN
    <br>because the kind of life she was living she didn’t like it.
    <br>You mean your friends who were into the same life-style, because of the change in your life-style said that
    <br>they also want come to the SCOAN?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ for that wonderful change.
    <br>What about spirit of lust, that pushed you to be sleeping with men?
    <br>How are you right now?
    <br>Do you still have that spirit pushing you?
    <br>No.
    <br>How have you been sleeping?
    <br>It has been two months since my deliverance and I no longer have interest in meeting men.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>We thank Jesus Christ for your life and life of your sister.
    <br>I think you are in the position to really advise once again young people around the world.
    <br>What do you really want to advise young people who are watching you right now?
    <br>Young people who are poor, I want to tell them that if anybody that deceives them to come with them
    <br>to make money, the money you will make, there is nothing to gain from it; you cannot use it to do anything.
    <br>If they tell you to go to spiritualists, they are putting more problems into your life;
    <br>there is nothing they can do for you.
    <br>So, you are advising people to embrace Jesus Christ... ?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
