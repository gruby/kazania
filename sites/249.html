  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, the Bible says, 'Come unto Me all ye that labour;
    <br>come, all ye that are troubled, and I will give you rest'.
    <br>I say in the name of Jesus, receive rest from all of your troubles.
    <br>Because of Christ, begin to receive rest!
    <br>Begin to receive rest from all of your troubles.
    <br>You that are sick, be healed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua, 
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>You that are troubled, you that are suffering,
    <br>receive rest, in the name Jesus!
    <br>Rest from all of your troubles, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I can hear someone say, "I am free!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank you!
