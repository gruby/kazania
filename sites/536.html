    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>When the power of God is present, healing is like breathing.
    <br>God really wants to heal, but unless you believe, you will not experience it.
    <br>Do you want to experience the power of God?
    <br>Do you need that extraordinary touch from the Holy Spirit?
    <br>It happened before.
    <br>In Botswana lives were changed.

    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thanks.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Please, clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Book of Matthew 4:23-24 says,
    <br>Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
    <br>preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease among the people.
    <br>News about Him spread all over and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases.
    <br>Those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures and the paralysed;
    <br>He healed them all.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Jesus, the Son of God, healed and still heals all kinds of sicknesses,
    <br>His Word is made health to all flesh.
    <br>Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! I am healed! Amen.
    <br>Lord has said it and we believe it.
    <br>All power in Heaven and on earth has been invested in that name - Jesus Christ.
    <br>We are not fighting men.
    <br>God called us to fight the devil
    <br>and the devil is furious because we have not stopped fighting.
    <br>You want to hit me?
    <br>It's something inside me.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Greater is He who is in us than he who is in the world.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>There was one proof then, there is one proof now - miracles in His name.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>The evidence of God's miracle is our rising and walking.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "I'm not the healer. I know the Healer. His name is Jesus Christ."
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>You can all see me now walking, doing things by myself.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>This woman came to The SCOAN possessed by a demon.
    <br>You can see her as she tries to attack Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The evil spirit that is controlling this woman is powerless in the face of God's armour and weapon.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Satan is the defeated foe; he knows it and we know it.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I'm dragon.
    <br>I was here to destroy.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>At a stage, I tried to attack the prophet but the power of God was just awesome.
    <br>I'm delivered! I want to praise the Lord for that.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Come out!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ - out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>As John 8:36 says; when the Son of God sets you free, you are free indeed.
    <br>I was demon-possessed.
    <br>I wanted to attack Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>but the authority of God in him was so powerful, so mighty.
    <br>It was impossible and he delivered me from the demon.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>What an honour and privilege it is to carry the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>to the four corners of the earth.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>I am here to do what I am born for, and I am living for, and I am going to die for.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Mark 16:15-17 says:
    <br>Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
    <br>And these signs will follow those who believe:
    <br>In My name they will cast out demons; they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>If millions of this generation are to believe, they must see proof
    <br>that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Never a healer like Jesus Christ.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the permanent solution - He changes not.
    <br>Who else can justly heal?
    <br>It is none other than Jesus Christ.
    <br>What a Son we have to worship, what a God we have to praise.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>I don't need to use these things anymore.
    <br>I'm a free woman.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Please, we are delivering the contrary spirits.
    <br>After that we can pray for the sick ones.
    <br>You have to confess.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>It is time for healing.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Put your hand anywhere you have the pain.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Begin to ask for forgiveness.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Ask Jesus to forgive you, "Forgive me my sin."
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be healed!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Right now check yourself.
    <br>You are healed.
    <br>Stand up, you are healed.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are healed.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Those of you that have no faith - I will pray for you, your faith will be enough.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Begin to stand up.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Begin to stand up.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>At the Korea for Christ crusade, Prophet T.B. Joshua continued to fulfill the purpose of his creation,
    <br>to glorify God in every situation he finds himself in.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>The people of Korea exercise their faith as people who want to receive from Jesus.
    <br>Everyday, thousands of sick and afflicted people shouted for Jesus' attention.
    <br>As it was, so it is.
    <br>I want to run tonight.
    <br>She wants to run.
    <br>You want to run?
    <br>You have that faith that Jesus will heal you?
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I think your faith encouraged me.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Your faith encouraged me.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, let it be according to your faith.
    <br>Your words are according to our faith.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>As you see the people rushing out to touch the man of God,
    <br>remember that in the Book of Acts 4:1-4, just one miracle brought 5,000 people to believe Jesus.
    <br>It was just the miracle that happened at the sport complex,
    <br>that is why you see the people trying to touch the man of God.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Just because He is no longer visible in our midst,
    <br>the lightening of God flows through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>To know God's presence is to know God's power.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Just as the woman with the issue of blood said,
    <br>"If I can just touch the helm of His garment, I know I will be well."
    <br>As it was, so it is.
    <br>They climb the trees to see him, just as Zacchaeus who climbed the sycamore tree in faith,
    <br>believing that he will see Jesus.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>At the Australia for Christ crusade, there was one way and one job:
    <br>The Way is Jesus Christ and the job is to tell others about Him.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "It is not my work but my faith in His finished work.
    <br>God's strength is made manifest in my weakness."
    <br>This is the demonstration of the instruction given to all believers in Matthew 10:8,
    <br>"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons.
    <br>Freely you have received, freely give."
    <br>For God has no hands but our hands to do His work today.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>I had a demon which had been there for 15 years.
    <br>God has delivered me from it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I saw some amazing things.
    <br>I saw people delivered in the name of Jesus Christ through the Prophet.
    <br>I saw healings. I saw people getting out of wheelchairs,
    <br>people with serious diseases such as cancer being healed in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I saw so many people from Sydney there.
    <br>It was the most amazing experience to feel the Holy Spirit working in our city.
    <br>I would love to see the Prophet come back to Australia
    <br>because we are really hungry for the Holy Spirit, the move of the miracles and the works of God!
    <br>The sick will be healed, the lame will walk, the blind will see, the deaf will hear,
    <br>the dumb will speak, captives will be set free, the afflicted will be made whole,
    <br>and demon-possessed will be delivered.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>This is the venue of the epic crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua in Colombia,
    <br>with the seating capacity of over 55,000 and with many more available
    <br>in the overflow facility.
    <br>This was going to be an event that would see the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>If my people, who are called by My name shall humble themselves and pray, and seek My face,
    <br>and turn from their wicked ways,
    <br>then I will hear from Heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
    <br>They recognized God's servant, they came in the thousands,
    <br>they knew this was divine arrangement, they believed this was their time,
    <br>this was their moment, this was their hour.
    <br>Their nation was about to experience God, His power, His presence, His glory.
    <br>This is the crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia.
    <br>Man of God, pray for me! I have multiple sclerosis.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Here is Mr Rosero who was healed at the Colombia crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He is now able to participate in all of his activities, tennis being one of his favourite sports,
    <br>which he approaches like a pro.
    <br>It looks like the ball is in his court.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>I have a herniated disc.
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???

    <br>After stating her problem, the man of God prays for her in Jesus' name.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>OK, go!
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>She is healed.
    <br>She came here with me and she could not stand up but she stood up.
    <br>An associate rushes forward to confirm the validity of her healing.
    <br>Can I hug you?
    <br>Congratulations.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord! I can walk!
    <br>Yes! Glory to God!
    <br>Father, Son and Holy Spirit, I am crying out to You;
    <br>You have given me a promise of healing and today is the day of my healing.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Exercising the authority and power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this woman, tapping each of her legs in the process,
    <br>as the healing power of God was at work.
    <br>He collects the crutches from her and she starts walking in the light of her confession.
    <br>The things I can do now is to go out alone; I can move by myself without any help.
    <br>I can move my legs now and go shopping, which I couldn't do before.
    <br>I thank God; the honour and glory belong to Him.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Jesus Christ healed her.
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>I feel free.
    <br>I can move freely without the lumbar corset I used to use.
    <br>I arrived at home from the stadium by 12am when everyone was sleeping.
    <br>I was full of Christ and anointing like I had just returned from a celebration!
    <br>I took my corset in my hand, threw it on the floor and stamped on it!
    <br>Where Will T.B. Joshua Go Next???
    <br>Thank You for remembering Colombia!
    <br>Man of God, help me in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Come on. Look here!
