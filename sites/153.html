    <br>I'm Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove from the United States of America.
    <br>Many years ago, when I was working with great men of God like A.A. Allen,
    <br>William Branham, Oral Roberts, R.W. Shambach, great men of the past,
    <br>I was riding one day in the automobile with A.A. Allen and he looked over at me
    <br>and he said, "Brother Upthegrove, I may not be living when this comes to pass
    <br>but I believe you will".
    <br>And he began to describe this place.
    <br>REVEALED: A.A Allen's Prophecy About T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>He began to talk about a man that would walk out under the anointing
    <br>and the power of the Almighty God.
    <br>REVEALED: A.A Allen's Prophecy About T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>He further described all of the miracles I have witnessed since I've been here.
    <br>A.A. Allen said, "Brother Upthegrove, there will be a multitude of people
    <br>from all over the world who will hear simultaneously.
    <br>He further began to tell me about the anointing and the power
    <br>that was going to come upon such men as Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>REVEALED: A.A Allen's Prophecy About T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>Ever since I've been here, I remembered when I first saw on Emmanuel TV
    <br>this man of God as he began to move in supernatural realms
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit
    <br>ministers Spirit-filled prayer, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>and instantly Jesus comes to the scene.
    <br>I can see!
    <br>I can see! Hallelujah!
    <br>and saw the prophecies that came to pass.
    <br>Brother, what did the doctor say about your medical report?
    <br>Forget about that.
    <br>I'm seeing a low sperm count.
    <br>Jesus Christ!
    <br>Why?
    <br>That is absolutely shocking.
    <br>That I can say that?
    <br>I'm shocked.
    <br>You are impossible.
    <br>When you possess faith, faith demands impossible.
    <br>What is ordinarily not possible, that is what faith does.
    <br>Make no mistake about it, you are living in the presence
    <br>of a mighty prophet sent from God.
    <br>REVEALED: A.A Allen's Prophecy About T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>God said to me as I was watching this man on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>"This is My prophet."
    <br>REVEALED: A.A Allen's Prophecy About T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>I have good news for you.
    <br>Jesus said, "I will be with you always, even to the end of the earth".
    <br>Jesus is alive.
    <br>Jesus lives.
    <br>He never said, "Goodbye".
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
