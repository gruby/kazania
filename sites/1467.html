  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>You are welcome to Nazareth -
    <br>the dawn of Christianity.
    <br>I welcome you once again to Nazareth, Israel - you are welcome.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>My name is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>People gave me different titles,
    <br>and you are one of them.
    <br>Some call me Pastor, some Bishop, some Reverend and some Prophet
    <br>but my name is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We are known by our life and practice, not what we say only.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>We are known by our life and practice.
    <br>Once again: my name is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you...
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>With due respect, if I may ask you, how do you feel?
    <br>How you feel does not matter because faith is not a feeling.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>How you feel does not matter because faith is not a feeling.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>How you feel does not matter because faith is not a feeling.
    <br>You are in a place you have read so much about in the Bible.
    <br>How you feel does not matter; faith is not a feeling.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Before we continue, let me give you a brief summary of where we are.
    <br>From human point of view,
    <br>Jesus’ father, Joseph,
    <br>His mother, Mary came from here.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Once again,
    <br>Jesus’ father, Joseph and His mother, Mary came from here.
    <br>What a blessing!
    <br>No other place would have been better for Jesus to come from.
    <br>It was God’s design.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>No other place would have been better for Jesus to come from.
    <br>It was God’s design.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I have been in Nazareth for some time now.
    <br>Nazareth is a humble place
    <br>filled with hardworking people.
    <br>A humble place filled with hardworking people.
    <br>What a wonderful place!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So, right now,
    <br>I want to take you to our lesson today -
    <br>the compassion and love of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>This will lead me to the title:
    <br>WE ARE KNOWN BY OUR LOVE - PART 1
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>I am known by my love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>This will take us to our reading;
    <br>the Book of Matthew 5:44.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Introduction to the Sermon on the mount.
    <br>Matthew 5:1.
    <br>“Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
    <br>His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them…”
    <br>Let's hear some of the important teachings Jesus taught His disciples.
    <br>Let me take you to the verse 11 in that Matthew 5.
    <br>“Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you
    <br>and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.”
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>I take again verse 11.
    <br>“Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you
    <br>and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
    <br>Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in Heaven…”
    <br>Let me take you also to verse 43.
    <br>Love for enemies.
    <br>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.’
    <br>But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
    <br>that you may be children of your Father in Heaven.
    <br>He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good,
    <br>and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.”
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>For better understanding of this text, the message I'm about to deliver,
    <br>take 1 John 3:18 - that will help you to understand what I'm about to talk about.
    <br>And the Book of Luke 23:34.
    <br>The Book of John 13:34.
    <br>We took our first text from the Book of Matthew 5.
    <br>1 John 3:18 also will help you to understand the message I'm about to deliver.
    <br>The Book of Luke 23:34.
    <br>And the Book of John 13:34.
    <br>WE ARE KNOWN BY OUR LOVE – PART 1
    <br>The word 'love' has been watered down today.
    <br>Love has lost its original meaning.
    <br>Today, we shall talk about love of God.
    <br>What does love of God mean?
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>What does love of God mean?
    <br>Jesus said plainly, ‘If you love Me, you will keep My commandments’.
    <br>How do we keep God’s commandments?
    <br>By doing what God wants, you demonstrate your love to Him:
    <br>Thou shall not kill, thou shall not destroy, thou shall not steal,
    <br>thou shall not tell lies, thou shall not bear false witness.
    <br>You demonstrate your love to Him by doing what God wants.
    <br>We are commanded to love.
    <br>God does not ask if you feel like loving; it is our responsibility.
    <br>Love one another.
    <br>What makes us human is not our ability to think but our ability to love one another.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Listen.
    <br>What makes us human is not our ability to think but our ability to love.
    <br>This means love is life.
    <br>If you miss love, you miss life.
    <br>You know what it means?
    <br>Missing love is missing life.
    <br>How do we start loving?
    <br>That is the question we need to ask ourselves
    <br>because the kind of love we have today is for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>How do we start loving?
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>How do we start loving?
    <br>We are not saying love for selfish reasons, for material reasons, for classic reasons.
    <br>We mean, to love better.
    <br>If you want to love better, you should start with someone who hates you.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>If you want to love better, you should start with someone who has bad feelings towards you,
    <br>who does not see anything good about you.
    <br>By doing this, you are copying Jesus’ kind of love as He demonstrated in that Book of Luke 23:34,
    <br>“Father, forgive them…”
    <br>Both the wrong and the right - “Father, forgive them…”
    <br>Both the righteous and unrighteous - “Father, forgive them…”
    <br>Both the bad and good - “Father, forgive them…”
    <br>Take note of the word ‘them’ because it includes both the offender and the offended.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>If you love many people but if there are those you do not love because they hate you,
    <br>they criticize you, they do not see anything good, they have bad feelings towards you,
    <br>then your love is as nothing.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>In Matthew 5:43-45,
    <br>He gives His sunshine and rain to all,
    <br>His blessing of health and long life to all.
    <br>He loves everyone with the same infinite love with which He loves you.
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>To what extent is your love like this?
    <br>Again!
    <br>[To what extent is your love like this?]
    <br>The more you love God, the more you love your neighbour.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>Your neighbour can be those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>The more you love God, the more you love your neighbour.
    <br>How many of your neighbours are on your daily prayer list?
    <br>Is your love a truly interceding love?
    <br>Can you stand in the gap?
    <br>Can you rejoice when they rejoice?
    <br>Let us love one another irrespective of race or religion
    <br>for love comes from God.
    <br>Whoever does not love does not know God because God is love.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>So, I want to leave you here.
    <br>Let us move to prayer section.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>But I would like to ask you a question:
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>I'm coming down to ask you.
    <br>You should be ready to answer.
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>Start loving those who do not share the same faith with you, those who criticize you,
    <br>those who do not see anything good in you, those who have bad feelings towards you.
    <br>OK, I'm coming to ask you.
    <br>You testify to this - thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 1
    <br>The question I want you to answer:
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>Are you ready to love those who criticize you, those who do not see anything good in you,
    <br>those who have bad feelings toward you?
    <br>That is the best way.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Thank you.
