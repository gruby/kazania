  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Evangelist Kingsley Ohama,
    <br>and beside me is my beautiful beloved.
    <br>I really want to appreciate God for what He has done.
    <br>He has been so faithful.
    <br>I must tell you I'm privileged to be part of the covenant of this commission.
    <br>It's a glorious thing indeed
    <br>because some months back, I was about leaving the office after the day's job.
    <br>As I was coming from the office,
    <br>I decided to pick my wife from her office and I dropped her home.
    <br>I was going back to pick something.
    <br>While I was on my way going, I noticed a vehicle behind me
    <br>and the vehicle was following me at 
    <br>every point, so I decided to stop.
    <br>Anywhere I stopped, the car stopped behind me.
    <br>When I moved, the car moved; when I stopped, it stopped.
    <br>So I was wondering, "What kind of car is this? Is it a coincidence or what?"
    <br>I didn't know that the devil had a plan.
    <br>As we were going, we got to a road.
    <br>I decided to go through the road because that road leads to my house.
    <br>I said to myself, "No, I will not go that way; probably, they are tracing me".
    <br>So I went through the other way,
    <br>believing that I was going to see a lot of people on that road.
    <br>Unfortunately, the road was also silent.
    <br>So while I was going, as I took the rear track of the road,
    <br>they went and turned on the other side of the road
    <br>and blocked me from the other side.
    <br>When they blocked me, four men came out of the car, all armed.
    <br>I thought they were policemen, I didn't know what to do.
    <br>When they walked up to me, they hit my glass and said, "Wind down".
    <br>I asked them, "For what? Who are you?"
    <br>I was doing like this in the car; while I was doing like this,
    <br>they were pointing the gun at me to open.
    <br>One spirit told me, "Drive and go".
    <br>When I looked in front of me, they were already putting those planks
    <br>that carry nails all over and my car was tubeless.
    <br>If I drove, I couldn't go far.
    <br>So I decided to look around when my mind said,
    <br>"Have you forgotten your Anointing Water?"
    <br>I opened my pigeon hole and took out my Anointing Water.
    <br>I laid my hands on the Anointing Water and said,
    <br>"Lord, as you have done it for everyone else who has stepped his feet here,
    <br>I have never had a testimony in my life from this commission.
    <br>Let this be the one and the greatest testimony".
    <br>While I was praying the prayer, I said, "Lord if in case you want them to kill me,
    <br>forgive my sin, and accept me as I come to Your Kingdom".
    <br>The men looked at me, and as I wind down,
    <br>they put the gun there and said, "Open the door".
    <br>I asked, "For what?"
    <br>He said, "Open the door or I will shoot you".
    <br>I wind down and opened the door
    <br>and he used the pistol and hit it on my head.
    <br>Immediately he hit it on my head, he pushed me out of the car,
    <br>and pushed me on the floor.
    <br>That one pressed my head on the floor.
    <br>While he was pressing my head on the floor, I was still saying,
    <br>"God of TB Joshua, if you know you are the God that TB Joshua serves,
    <br>and if you know that I am a covenant child who has partook from the covenant altar of TB Joshua,
    <br>let there be life now, fight for me for You said,
    <br>You will fight for Your people, when we have no strength.
    <br>Vengeance is Yours, while victory is ours".
    <br>Instantly, the other one who was pressing me on the floor told the other one,
    <br>"Open the boot".
    <br>They opened the boot and saw some money that we worked for, from the office.
    <br>They wanted to collect it, looked at the money
    <br>and said, "This is not the kind of money we need.
    <br>Are you telling me that this kind of big man is carrying only N200 or what?
    <br>What is N200? Nonsense!"
    <br>The other one said, "Start the car, let's take the car"
    <br>and the guy entered into my car.
    <br>I didn't know what was happening; I believed that the car was gone.
    <br>All I saw was that the car refused to start, no key.
    <br>They were looking for the key,
    <br>The other one came out and said, "I told you!" - he spoke my dialect.
    <br>I looked at him, I was just praying there.
    <br>Before I knew what was happening, he tried to open the car
    <br>from under the car so that he could join the wires together.
    <br>While he was about doing that,
    <br>he had a slap on his face and came out of the car,
    <br>jumping out, shouting, "There is somebody inside this car!"

    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>That was when I knew that the invisible Master had arrived.
    <br>Evangelist Kingsley Ahunoma & Wife
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>That was when I knew that the altar that runs my life had arrived.
    <br>He came out of the car; the second one said,
    <br>"What kind of stupidity is this? That's why I hate working with you.
    <br>You are always like a woman".
    <br>He brought something out of his pocket - a red band and tied it around his waist.
    <br>He told me, "Watch what I will do now".
    <br>He entered the car - that one that entered with the red band
    <br>came out with more injury than the first one that entered.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>All I heard was - he was shouting in my dialect, "Blood, blood".
    <br>I was wondering where the blood was coming from.
    <br>Instantly, 'a cold', something like ice came into me.
    <br>And that was when I remembered that I have a God that cannot die.
    <br>I stood up and that's when I told them, "If you want to kill me, kill me.
    <br>But I must tell you that this car is going nowhere".
    <br>Another one said, "Look at this idiot. Finish him! Just finish him! Don't mind him!"
    <br>They cocked the gun.
    <br>I'm from a military background; I know what it means to cock a gun.
    <br>A gun was cocked and they shot
    <br>and the trigger refused to respond.
    <br>Evangelist Kingsley Ahunoma & Wife
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>The trigger refused to respond
    <br>and when these things were happening, beloved,
    <br>I was having my Anointing Water in my hand.
    <br>That was when I was talking to God.
    <br>I said, "I know it's not yet my time
    <br>because if it was my time, You would have taken me earlier than this.
    <br>Instantly, the other one that came out,
    <br>he was carrying the gun and shot in the air.
    <br>The pistol responded.
    <br>He faced it back to me and shot; it refused to come out.
    <br>Evangelist Kingsley Ahunoma & Wife
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>That was the second bullet I received but did not respond,
    <br>and that was the second time the devil said, "Your life will go"
    <br>but God said, "It's not yet time".
    <br>The other one came out and said, "There is a problem here.
    <br>I will make sure I defy that charm that you carry. I will spoil it".
    <br>As they were running around my car, a siren was coming from every angle.
    <br>As the siren was coming, I thought it was a policeman.
    <br>I had confidence.
    <br>When they came, it was just a driver.
    <br>When the armed robbers saw the car coming, they started shouting.
    <br>All of them entered into their car and ran away.
    <br>Evangelist Kingsley Ahunoma & Wife
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>At the time they attempted to shoot you but the bullet did not come out,
    <br>what was your reaction? What happened to you at that moment?
    <br>When they were about to release the gun on me, the only thing I said was a prayer.
    <br>I just prayed a prayer, saying, "God, accept me"
    <br>because I didn't believe that the bullet would not come out.
    <br>I believed that that was the end of my life.
    <br>But I knew that somehow, somehow, even if the bullets came out,
    <br>I had already asked the Lord to forgive my sins and accept me to His Kingdom.
    <br>I didn't know that God was about to give me a testimony
    <br>I had been looking for all these days.
    <br>Evangelist Kingsley Ahunoma & Wife
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>And what happened after that, sir?
    <br>After everything, after they had left,
    <br>a man came and asked, "What happened?"
    <br>I told him, "Some armed robbers just attacked me here".
    <br>He said, "Are you serious?"
    <br>I said, "Yes".
    <br>Most of the people, police were around
    <br>but when they came out to intervene, they had already gone.
    <br>That was how this mighty God saved my life.

    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Evangelist Kingsley Ahunoma & Wife
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>Sir, when the other vehicles were coming with sirens
    <br>and the armed robbers immediately ran into their car and left,
    <br>just tell us - when that vehicle came, who was the person inside?
    <br>Who was the actual person that was there?
    <br>Although the armed robbers were assuming it was the police, who was actually in that vehicle?
    <br>When the siren car was driving closer to me,
    <br>I thought it was full of policemen.
    <br>However, when the siren car arrived,
    <br>the only person in that car was just a driver.
    <br>But they thought it was the police coming;
    <br>they didn't know it was just a driver.
    <br>When the vehicle was coming closer to me, I was the one that waved to the vehicle.
    <br>The vehicle stopped and the driver asked,
    <br>"What happened? Why is your car opened like this?"
    <br>I then told him what had happened.
    <br>He was the one that shined his light and I saw where my key had fallen into.
    <br>I picked my key and drove off.
    <br>Evangelist Kingsley Ahunoma & Wife
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>Indeed, this testimony is a wonderful evidence to show the protection
    <br>we are under by the grace of God
    <br>as our brother here was privileged to have the Anointing Water with him.
    <br>He held it with him throughout this encounter
    <br>and indeed, God came to his rescue.
    <br>Sir, the fact that you're here today standing in our midst is such a wonderful testimony.
    <br>What is your advice to viewers around the world?
    <br>My advice to viewers all around the world is:
    <br>If you know you serve God and you believe in God,
    <br>really believe in His Word according to the Scripture,
    <br>'No weapon formed against you shall ever prosper'.
    <br>No matter what the weapon looks like,
    <br>as far as God you carry lives in you, it will never prosper.
    <br>Believe in this God and believe in this commission - the Lord will be Your Helper.
    <br>Yes, lest I forget: There was something that happened
    <br>when the armed robber pointed the gun at me.
    <br>When they pointed the gun at me and shot,
    <br>the bullet did not come out, they shot the second time,
    <br>I didn't see any bullet coming out.
    <br>That was when I had this courage in me
    <br>and I stood up and said, "Your gun is not responding".
    <br>They looked at me and said, "That charm that you are using,
    <br>we are going to disarm it today".
    <br>I started laughing because I didn't believe
    <br>that a gun could actually be shot at me and the bullet would not come out.
    <br>But I thank God that at the end of the day, this faithful God kept me alive.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty, and indeed, we thank Jesus Christ for our brother's life.
    <br>We just want to hear a very quick word from your wife.
    <br>Madam, just introduce yourself.
    <br>What can you say to thank God for your husband's testimony?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ijeoma Nwaogu.
    <br>I just want to thank God for everything He has done in the life of my husband
    <br>because if the devil had actually carried out his plan to fulfillment,
    <br>maybe he won't be standing beside me here today.
    <br>I just want to thank God for everything.
    <br>I just give God all the praise.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Amen! One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
