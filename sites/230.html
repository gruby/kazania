    <br>Mrs Blessing Osi has come to The SCOAN
    <br>to seek solution from the terrible problem of leg ulcer.
    <br>She is seated in a vehicle
    <br>as the ulcer has rendered her unable to walk.
    <br>As you can see, the flesh on her thigh has been completely eaten away by the ulcer.
    <br>The rotting skin is hanging from her thigh.
    <br>The entire skin of her leg has been infected and is pealing away.
    <br>MIGHTY MIRACLE
    <br>Maggot Infested Leg Supernaturally Healed!!!
    <br>The ulcer has spread all the way round the back of her leg, tearing away her skin.
    <br>Imagine the excruciating pain of anything touching the bare and infected flesh.
    <br>See the pus and dead skin leaking from the ulcer and seeping onto the mat below.
    <br>MIGHTY MIRACLE
    <br>Maggot Infested Leg Supernaturally Healed!!!
    <br>Inside the white container are live maggots that were inside the wound eating away at the infected flesh.
    <br>My name is Blessing Osi.
    <br>I am 40 years old.
    <br>I stay at Rivers State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is leg ulcer.
    <br>I cannot walk.
    <br>I cannot sleep.
    <br>I cannot eat well.
    <br>I have pains in my body.
    <br>I don't feel comfortable at all.
    <br>Who has directed you here today?
    <br>I always watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Now that you are here, what is your belief?
    <br>I know that God will heal me.
    <br>At The SCOAN prayer line, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mrs Blessing Osi, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Mrs Osi is declared free and rises to her feet.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I can walk.
    <br>I could not walk before.
    <br>I can walk now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Father.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Some time later, Mrs Blessing Osi came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify of a completely healed leg.
    <br>MIGHTY MIRACLE
    <br>Maggot Infested Leg Supernaturally Healed!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Walking into The SCOAN and waving her hands in thanksgiving to God
    <br>is Mrs Blessing Osi who comes forward to share her testimony of what Jesus Christ has done in her life.
    <br>After being healed of a leg ulcer, she is now able to wear shoes
    <br>and displays a perfectly healed leg and open footwear.
    <br>It is difficult to believe that this is the very leg and area that had once been ravaged by the ulcer.
    <br>The face of the ulcer is now closed, revealing brand new skin.
    <br>Brimming with joy, she shows it all by her smile, "Thank You, Jesus. I am healed".
    <br>She moves her hand along her leg - something she was unable to do before.
    <br>Now, it is time to tell the whole world her testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Blessing Osi.
    <br>I am from Rivers State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was leg ulcer.
    <br>I could not walk. I could not move. I could not go anywhere.
    <br>They used to carry me to the toilet.
    <br>I could not go anywhere.
    <br>Even coming here from Port Harcourt, my son had to bring me.
    <br>He always carried me to the toilet.
    <br>When I was brought to The SCOAN,
    <br>I could not walk.
    <br>They put me inside a taxi and brought me here.
    <br>The man of God came, laid his hand on me and prayed for me.
    <br>And I'm free!
    <br>The pain just disappeared.
