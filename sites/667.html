    <br>VIEWER'S PRAYER
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, whatever position you are in,
    <br>are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to view us,
    <br>once you are under the influence of this voice, begin to release yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are created to lead!
    <br>Begin to lead, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In every area of your life, begin to lead, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are created to lead!
    <br>Begin to lead, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Greater is He!
    <br>It is not less is He; it is greater is He!
    <br>This is why I command that spirit of leader!
    <br>You will lead others, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to lead others, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your business, begin to lead others, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your finances, begin to lead others, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your career, begin to lead others, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Lead, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess your freedom, your triumph!
    <br>Confess your triumph!
    <br>Confess your victory!
    <br>Viewers, your health - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>If there is anywhere, any area, any faculty, any organ that is sick,
    <br>be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it your kidney, your blood, your liver, your heart, every organ - be healed!
    <br>Be restored!
    <br>By the power of the Holy Ghost, by the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>Rejoice!
