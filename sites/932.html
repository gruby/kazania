    <br>TB JOSHUA CRUSADE IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC!!! | Nov 2017
    <br>It was foretold that when Christ would come to save us
    <br>the blind would see,
    <br>the lame would walk,
    <br>the demon-possessed would be set free,
    <br>the afflicted would be liberated,
    <br>the poor would be blessed.
    <br>Jesus lives and still works wonders today.
    <br>Are you ready to make His Word the standard for your life?
    <br>If you are ready, Christ is willing.
    <br>Join T.B. Joshua in Dominican Republic.
    <br>Destinies will be restored, 
    <br>finances will be released,
    <br>the broken-hearted will be comforted.
    <br>24 & 25 of November 2017, Felix Sanchez Olympic Stadium, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
    <br>Entry is free.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade with T.B. Joshua -
