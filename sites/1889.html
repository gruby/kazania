    <br>HEADLINE: "Virus pandemic exposes inequality in Ecuador's Guayaquil"
    <br>Ecuador is one of the poorest countries in South America
    <br>and also one of the hardest hit by the virus pandemic.
    <br>T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV had helped this nation following the catastrophic earthquake of 2016,
    <br>and now both the national Government and local NGOs reached out to T.B. Joshua for support.
    <br>The Director of Cooperation of the Association of Ecuadorian Municipalities (AME)
    <br>sent an email to T.B. Joshua outlining the country's various needs that arose due to the pandemic.
    <br>She wrote, "Knowing your sense of humanity and solidarity, I am asking you to analyse the possibility,
    <br>through your institution, to support us with donations to meet the needs described above
    <br>so that the 221 Municipalities of Ecuador can better cope with the effects of the crisis
    <br>and reduce the impact in a timely manner.
    <br>Confident of your solidarity, we ratify the commitment and willingness of our institution
    <br>to comply with and support initiatives to mitigate the spread of the virus.
    <br>We are one world and now one fight.
    <br>For local solidarity, Mireille Vásconez, Director of Cooperation, Association of Ecuadorian Municipalities.
    <br>The request did not fall on deaf ears, and funded by T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>the local Emmanuel TV Team mobilised and gathered in Guayaquil
    <br>to arrange the purchase, packing and distribution of 1,500 much needed food and hygiene boxes
    <br>for the devastated neighbouring community of Duran.
    <br>Good Morning; my name is Rubén de la Cruz from Esmeraldas, Ecuador.
    <br>Today, we are in Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador and the most affected by the virus.
    <br>We are at the collection centre for the charity project.
    <br>Here, we are going to prepare 1,500 food and hygiene boxes, which is about 40 tonnes of food.
    <br>All this is possible thanks to the love for the needy from Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Many thanks for this amazing work of love Prophet T.B. Joshua is doing in our country, Ecuador.
    <br>Join us as we prepare these kits for the Emmanuel TV project in the Durán community.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>We are here in Guayaquil where Prophet T.B. Joshua, moved by his great heart,
    <br>has sent thousands of aid kits to help the Durán community in Guayaquil.
    <br>This is due to the pandemic, which has caused much damage in Ecuador and the whole world.
    <br>As Ecuadorians, we are very grateful to Prophet T.B. Joshua for his mission of helping the needy.

    <br>The team assembles and prays for God's mercy, favour and protection as they prepare
    <br>to drive with four trucks to the wholesale market district to purchase the all important supplies.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Ecuador Outreach To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>The team reassembles, organising the logistics for the large-scale purchase and loading work.
    <br>Many of the provisions purchased by T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>have already been prepared by the Wholesaler,
    <br>and are ready for the Emmanuel TV Team to check and load onto the waiting trucks.

    <br>After the first truck is fully loaded, they cover the goods to secure them for the journey ahead.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Ecuadorian Partners continue to load the other trucks, ready for distribution to the needy.

    <br>The four heavily laden trucks with their precious cargo now travel back to the Emmanuel TV base,
    <br>where the vital food and hygiene items will be unloaded and packed into individual kits for 1,500 needy families.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Ecuador Outreach To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>Good Morning, Emmanuel TV viewers all around the world!
    <br>We are here at the collection centre where we are packing the food and hygiene boxes.
    <br>Finally, these boxes will be given to the needy community, which is the final stage of the project.

    <br>Thank you very much!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am going to explain what is inside one of the kits we have prepared
    <br>to give to the Durán community.
    <br>Here, we have a toothbrush, toothpaste, face masks,
    <br>soap, sanitizer, washing soap, sugar, salt, crackers, lentils, oats, rice, noodles,
    <br>pasta, cooking oil and toilet paper.
    <br>Thank God and thank you, Emmanuel TV, for making these food kits available.

    <br>Emmanuel TV Ecuador Outreach To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has taught us that the greatest in the sight of God is the one who loves his neighbour.
    <br>God does not ask if we feel like loving; as a Christian it is our responsibility to love one another.
    <br>What makes us human is not our ability to think but our ability to love.
    <br>When we love for God’s sake we are sowing to the Spirit, because the love we give away is the only love we keep.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Ecuador Outreach To The Needy During Lockdown
