    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>What happened?
    <br>They want to jail me with my children because of a debt.
    <br>They want to do what?
    <br>To jail me and my children because of the debt that I am owing.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Money lenders. I borrowed money to start my business, the business collapsed and I could not pay.
    <br>They want to jail you?
    <br>Yes, man of God, set me free.
    <br>What did you use the money for?
    <br>I used it to open my business.
    <br>How much is the money?
    <br>It is 350,000 (naira).
    <br>How much do you have?
    <br>I don’t have any. Everything scattered.
    <br>What do you have in the shop?
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>I'm selling as if I am not selling. I am not seeing the money.
    <br>I am not seeing anything.
    <br>I did not use it to buy anything. I could not even use it to feed.
    <br>I can't pay my rent. I can't pay my store rent.
    <br>Are you living alone?
    <br>I am with my children. From Warri (Delta, Nigeria) to this place, I borrowed money to come.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>Another woman took him from me.
    <br>I have been suffering with the children for four years.
    <br>OK, it is alright.
    <br>Your children, are they schooling?
    <br>They are schooling but there is no money to pay their school fees.
    <br>What is your problem now? Is it you debt? Or your…
    <br>It is the debt, first of all. They want to jail me and my children. Every day, they threaten me.
    <br>So, they will jail me with you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Don't worry. It's alright. You will receive your deliverance.
    <br>Don't worry, OK?
    <br>Your deliverance is more important.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Jesus will pay your money.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>After paying your money, He will deliver you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>OK, don't cry.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Jesus will help us to pay it.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>OK, it's alright.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>The Lord will use me to deliver her and to pay the debt, which is 350,000 naira.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>People of God, I want you to support now.
    <br>This woman must have something to train her children and start business back.
    <br>In response to T.B. Joshua's injunction, members begin to come forward to contribute what they have,
    <br>in order to support the woman.
    <br>Different currencies and denominations were given by the congregation comprising of
    <br>both national and international worshippers.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>More and more people trooped out to give a worthy offering,
    <br>knowing that what they have in their hands now
    <br>can be a solution to the problem at hand.
    <br>Mrs. Christopher cannot hide her feelings of joy and surprise
    <br>as the congregation continues flooding to the offering bowls.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Can you give the woman the 350,000 (naira)?
    <br>Look at the screen of your TV. There is a man of God handing over...
    <br>giving her the sum of 350,000 naira in cash.
    <br>The amount she owes...
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>This woman must go home with 2 million naira.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Oh, this is how you are!
    <br>I used to say that it's a lie, the good things you do.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>More and more.
    <br>Is it for me?
    <br>Sister, is it true? All this is for me?
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>If you must receive, you must learn to give - your love, your kindness.
    <br>What we are doing now, we are not doing to display this
    <br>but we are communicating to you that this is what the Gospel is all about: care, cheerful giver.
    <br>T.B. Joshua gives the lady a hug, as a way of thanking her for even receiving the gift.
    <br>The container was then taken to a secure place and counted under the supervision of Mrs. Christopher,
    <br>to ensure honesty and transparency.
    <br>Now, Mrs. Christopher is going home with more than sufficient funds to pay her debts,
    <br>with the assurance that she will receive the remaining donation that the members were still contributing,
    <br>which would finally add up to the total of 2 million naira mentioned by T.B. Joshua.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Patience Christopher. I am from Ugale South, Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am very happy for what the man of God has done in my life today.
    <br>I came here wretchedly from Warri, owing debt.
    <br>The people I was owing were threatening me and threatening
    <br>my children that they were going to jail me and my children.
    <br>They even arrested me.
    <br>The money that I was owing is 350,000 naira.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN for the first time today, I cried and shouted to the man of God.
    <br>The man of God does not know me and I do not know him but as he was passing by,
    <br>they showed me the man of God and I cried and called upon him.
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>What happened?
    <br>They want to jail me with my children because of debt.
    <br>How much is the money?
    <br>It is 350,000 (naira).
    <br>He answered me and said that they should give me 350,000 (naira).
    <br>Can you give the woman 350,000 (naira)?
    <br>Look at the screen of your TV, there is a man of God...
    <br>And that the members should contribute.
    <br>People of God, I want you to support now.
    <br>This woman must have something to train her children and start business back.
    <br>After the contribution, I realised 750,000 naira, and
    <br>the members are still contributing and I am not a member of this church.
    <br>This is my first time of coming to this place. I am very, very surprised for
    <br>what God has used them to do for me today.
    <br>After receiving 350,000 naira from T.B. Joshua, the members contributed a further 750,000 naira,
    <br>and the members are still contributing.
    <br>Now, she not only has enough money to pay off her debt, she can restart her business
    <br>and care for her family.
    <br>Glory be to God.
