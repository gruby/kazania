    <br>TB JOSHUA CARES FOR THE ELDERLY
    <br>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
    <br>Every rightful man simply has great habits.
    <br>This is one of my habits:
    <br>To see to the welfare of our elderly ones,
    <br>most especially before and after my communion with God.
    <br>Why the elderly?
    <br>Because their cases demand urgent attention,
    <br>most especially at this time when this monster sickness has made them scapegoats,
    <br>with no one to care.
    <br>Brethren, Merry Christmas And Happy New Year!
    <br>We have the elderly, the less privileged, the orphans, the sick and so on and so forth.
    <br>Make sure you see to their welfare.
    <br>That will be the 'Amen' to your prayer.
    <br>Don't just pray without looking around to see who is in need.
    <br>Watch and pray (1 Thessalonians 5:17).
    <br>Let us go!
    <br>Merry Christmas And Happy New Year!

    <br>I had made arrangements for Baba before I left Lagos.
    <br>I will give you the gifts so that you can complete the process and bury Baba.
    <br>If Baba was indebted to anyone, you can use some of the money to pay up the debt
    <br>and make necessary arrangements.
    <br>I have brought a cash gift of 300,000 naira for Baba.
    <br>Thank you very much! We are very grateful!
    <br>May you continue to succeed.
    <br>When did Baba pass away?
    <br>He died the day before yesterday, around 5 a.m.
    <br>We brought five bags of rice and a cash gift of 300,000 naira.
    <br>You should remove Baba's body from the mortuary and bury him.
    <br>If Baba had had the chance,
    <br>he would have requested that his body not be taken to the mortuary
    <br>but to be buried immediately.
    <br>Any further arrangements may be done after the burial.
    <br>Now that you have money and bags of rice, go and make preparations for Baba's burial.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Thank you! May God continue to assist you.
    <br>How old was Baba?
    <br>115 years old.
    <br>Thank you very much.
