    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>During a live service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua gave a prophecy concerning Abuja, the capital of Nigeria.
    <br>These were his words:
    <br>Listen to me, my people in Nigeria.
    <br>Once again, take note of this:
    <br>Our security should be vigilant.
    <br>I am seeing a very big strike - explosion.
    <br>They should take care of Abuja - capital.
    <br>When I talk, you see me in a bad light, but I will keep talking.
    <br>I don't need to say the state, but I am saying it.
    <br>This is what I am seeing happen in Abuja.
    <br>They should pray!
    <br>What can they do to capture this?
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
