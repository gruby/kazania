  <p>    
    <br>Come on, give the Lord a shout in here!
    <br>Hallelujah - as we continue to lift up the name of Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah You have won the victory
    <br>Lift up your voice and say:
    <br>Hallelujah You have won it all for me
    <br>Death could not hold You down
    <br>You are the risen King
    <br>Seated in Majesty
    <br>You are the risen King
    <br>Death could not hold You down
    <br>You are the risen King
    <br>Seated in Majesty
    <br>You are the risen King
    <br>Let me say it like this:
    <br>Death could not hold You down
    <br>The grave could not contain You
    <br>Because You have risen
    <br>Now I have a reason
    <br>A reason to praise You
    <br>And live my life for You
    <br>Precious Redeemer
    <br>You reign forever
    <br>Death could not hold You down
    <br>The grave could not contain You
    <br>Because You have risen
    <br>We all have a reason
    <br>A reason to praise Your name
    <br>And live my life for You
    <br>Precious Redeemer
    <br>You reign forever
    <br>Death could not hold You down
    <br>You are the risen King
    <br>Seated in majesty
    <br>We love You
    <br>You are the risen King
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>I know you are feeling the atmosphere by faith.
    <br>Thank you. Hallelujah.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Happy New Year!
    <br>By faith, you have been ushered to the New Year!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know the thinking of every Christian is how to remain focused.
    <br>Our Christian life demands for that.
    <br>I say, "Remain focused".
    <br>No matter what happens, no matter what comes, your focus should not be broken.
    <br>Your focus should not be what?
    <br>Broken.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let us just reflect about the year we are waiting for, the outgoing and incoming year.
    <br>To many others, the New Year is one with a new possession -
    <br>a new house, cars, friends, children, a new job, relations.
    <br>Just think about that.
    <br>To many others, they think they are fulfilled when they have all these.
    <br>To them, it is a New Year indeed.
    <br>A New Year is a gift from God - a part of divine nature of God.
    <br>If the New Year is a part of the divine nature of God,
    <br>in the New Year, therefore, you are called to God's kind of lifestyle - His divine essence,
    <br>not in terms of unfaithfulness, injustice and corruption
    <br>but of steadfastness, faithfulness and love.
    <br>I want to remind you the promise of God, the New Morning Water is out for the year.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, it is time for the work of faith. It takes faith to receive it.
    <br>It's out to fight the hardship and demon that cause you to lose control and commit shameful acts.
    <br>It's out to fight it!
    <br>That is it.
    <br>I will have a great relief this new year because of this.
    <br>A great relief.
    <br>Because when you have it, you only come and gives thanks to God.
    <br>Ok. This is it.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Remember, God is the reason for the year.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Remember, God is the reason for the year.
    <br>Nothing of God can be possible without our heart being pure.
    <br>That is why you keep trying and trying by error; it is not possible.
    <br>God is the reason for the year.
    <br>Nothing of God can be possible unless our heart is pure.
    <br>Christ tells us in Matthew 5:8, 'Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall see God in the year'.
    <br>That is why you keep trying and trying, writing application, doing this and that, praying
    <br>because your heart is not pure - grudges, pain of the past, holding offence.
    <br>Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us - this is our confession but we fail to follow this.
    <br>Nothing of God can be possible unless our heart is pure.
    <br>You have to dedicate your heart to the Word of God.
    <br>The Word of God is not to memorise but mediate on it day and night.
    <br>I mean, you have to abide in the Word.
    <br>Let the Word of God abide in you and you abide in it.
    <br>Look at my Faith Bracelet.
    <br>This is why we came out with this.
    <br>My own is here.
    <br>That is why we came out with this - to help you.
    <br>As you are sitting now, you are supposed to fire on.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You, oh Lord Jesus.
    <br>This is what we mean by meditating on it day and night.
    <br>All those days in the house, you sit watching your television,
    <br>watching all sorts of programmes.
    <br>As you are watching your programme, fire on.
    <br>It is not every time you can go to your altar on your knees and pray before going to sleep.
    <br>Sometimes, you get so tired.
    <br>You just go on your bed, let it be in your hand, 'Take more of me, give me more of You'
    <br>and you sleep off.
    <br>Inside the plane, inside the vehicle.
    <br>But people seem to turn it to fashion now.
    <br>When they are going, they ask, "Which colour?"
    <br>"Blue, red, yellow..."
    <br>Well done.
    <br>Nothing of God can be possible unless your heart is pure.
    <br>Pure means free spirit.
    <br>But your heart is not free.
    <br>You think of affliction, your problem, this and that,
    <br>how to get this, how to celebrate the new year.
    <br>What is that?
    <br>You need a free spirit to contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>Nothing of God can be possible unless your heart is free.
    <br>Dedicate your heart to the Word of God.
    <br>This will help you to dedicate it.
    <br>By the time you continue to meditate on it, it will become an integral part of your being.
    <br>'Take more of me, give me more of You.'
    <br>You have to dedicate your heart to the Word of God.
    <br>Meditate on it day and night.
    <br>Let the Word abide in you and you in it.
    <br>To have a new beginning which we call New Year, the Word of God must dominate your heart.
    <br>It's not just by reading but by meditation. 
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Then, you can stop looking and thinking about where you are coming from.
    <br>We are coming from unrighteousness which boasts in itself.
    <br>When we have breakthrough, we say, "Hey, it's by our hard work!"
    <br>But when failure comes, you begin to look for a scapegoat.
    <br>"Why does God not answer me? I attend church regularly."
    <br>But when you are okay, you never...
    <br>This coming year - I'm supposed to bring the revelation, what you should expect next year.
    <br>I compiled everything.
    <br>I was just looking at it. Many of those things are things you already know about
    <br>because the signs we are seeing now cannot be overcome in just one year.
    <br>This coming year is a year you must be ready to fight the battle to survive.
    <br>Think of your survival.
    <br>It's a year your children need to sit at your feet and learn from you.
    <br>Share your experience with them - it's a parable.
    <br>I will bring the prophecies to you.
    <br>But I don't know...
    <br>Before I give them to you, take your time to go through what I said last year.
    <br>Go and read more about what I said last year.
    <br>Just look at what I said last year
    <br>so that when you receive this, you will not be ignorant.
    <br>We are in a warfare where the serious-minded will be victorious.
    <br>When you dedicate your heart to the Word of God,
    <br>you have that ability from God to stop looking or thinking about where you are coming from
    <br>and start looking at where you are going.
    <br>That is the ability from God.
    <br>It's not possible for anyone to say, "No, I forget about the past", without God
    <br>because it's only that information satan has about you - your past.
    <br>It appears that it is the only information satan has - your past.
