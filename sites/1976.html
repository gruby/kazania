    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is praying for the nursing mothers in the prayer line at The SCOAN.
    <br>He prays for Mrs Tina Itimi who is booked for an operation and has come for safe delivery.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her,
    <br>the healing power of our Lord Jesus Christ is being released into her system
    <br>and immediately you can see the baby beginning to move under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>The man of God moves on to pray for others
    <br>that have come to the prayer line with various problems and afflictions.
    <br>They are believing that God will take them out of their problems
    <br>and they shall not go back, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua returns to pray for Mrs Itimi.
    <br>Tears roll down her face during the prayer indicating that the power of God is present.
    <br>Begin to share your testimony. Thank you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua declares them all free in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>Mrs Itimi slowly stands and seems to be in a state of discomfort.
    <br>God's anointed servant, T.B. Joshua, rushes to a private room where Mrs Itimi has been taken for delivery.
    <br>Signs of labour are apparent.
    <br>She is experiencing contractions and is breathing heavily.
    <br>She lies on the floor as T.B. Joshua offers Spirit prayer over her condition.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In no time at all the baby is born!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God for He makes impossibilities possible!
    <br>There is no need greater than our God.
    <br>This was done so that the generations to come may believe in Him and trust in His goodness.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Mrs Tina Itimi.
    <br>This man standing behind me is my husband,
    <br>and the woman beside me is my husband's sister.
    <br>My husband's sister brought me here.
    <br>It is my first time coming to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>The doctor at the hospital told me that I would have to deliver my baby through an operation
    <br>because I have a tight cervix, my baby is in the wrong position and is not breathing.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me,
    <br>I began to feel some signs in my body
    <br>and I delivered my baby safely.
    <br>Mrs Tina Itimi - Baby Delivery Testimony
    <br>My name is Mr John Itimi.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>was the inability of my wife to give birth to our baby.
    <br>We were in the hospital that morning when she couldn't give birth
    <br>and the doctor said that she had a tight cervix
    <br>and the only way for her to give birth is through an operation.
    <br>I called my eldest sister on the telephone and said,
    <br>"Sister, this is the problem we have at the hospital.
    <br>We can't control the situation".
    <br>Immediately she said that she had to take us to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>She believed, that by the grace of God, when the anointed man of God came, everything would be over.
    <br>That is how we were rushed down to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>They arranged us in the prayer line.
    <br>When the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, came out,
    <br>he lay an anointed hand on my wife
    <br>and immediately the Spirit of God fell on her
    <br>and that is how she gave birth without an operation. Glory be to God!
