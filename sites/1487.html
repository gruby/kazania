  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, let me pray with you.
    <br>Father, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come.
    <br>I command the Kingdom of God in your heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive the Kingdom of God!
    <br>Whatever sin, whatever affliction, whatever unforgiving spirit -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being released!
    <br>This is what I have seen.
    <br>Do you agree with me, viewers all over the world?
    <br>I can see you being released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Confess your freedom there! Confess your release!
    <br>Begin to confess your release!
    <br>My health has been released from affliction, pain, sickness, disease.
    <br>Right now, be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Any organ afflicted - be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it your blood, fluids, kidneys, liver - be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>No matter the difficulty, no matter the pain -
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal; never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I can see you being released!
    <br>If you are one of them, let me hear your 'Amen!'
