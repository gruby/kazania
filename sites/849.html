    <br>The lightening of God moves in the midst of the congregation,
    <br>dispelling all shades of darkness
    <br>through the medium of the Morning Water used by the evangelists
    <br>who have been sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Remember! Where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>Let us watch as the darkness in the life of this boy
    <br>and his family are dispelled in Jesus' name.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus! Who are you? Who are you in this body?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>Speak out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>What have you done to his family?
    <br>I destroyed them.
    <br>How did you destroy them?
    <br>My name is Destruction.
    <br>Destruction, how have you destroyed the family?
    <br>How have you destroyed this man?
    <br>Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I don't allow them to prosper.
    <br>You don't allow them to prosper - how?
    <br>I ruin their businesses.
    <br>You ruin their businesses? What else?
    <br>I close all doors.
    <br>What have you done to his future and his education?
    <br>He's a star.
    <br>But that star belongs to me.
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Who are these people here?
    <br>Who are these people next to you?
    <br>The aunty.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome.
    <br>Who is he to you?
    <br>He's my nephew.
    <br>He is your nephew?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What can you say about his behaviour?
    <br>There is no progress in the family.
    <br>He stopped going to school.
    <br>He will tell them he's going to school.
    <br>He took the school fees and ate them.
    <br>He would say he was going and go to his friend's house and stay there.
    <br>He didn't take his exams.
    <br>He collected money for assignments but didn't do the assignments.
    <br>He will come and tell us that he went to school.
    <br>Somebody from the school called.
    <br>"Do you know that Jeffery has not been coming to school? Is there any problem?"
    <br>We were all shocked.
    <br>I had to take it upon myself to go to school and found out that he was never in school.
    <br>When we asked him, he told us that he was going to his friend's house to smoke
    <br>and that he used the money to gamble.
    <br>His father's business locked up; there was no progress in the family.
    <br>Today is our happiest day.
    <br>I just bless God for helping me bring him to church today.
    <br>He came; I am so happy that God visited our family.
    <br>Amen! We thank God.
    <br>So, who is he to you?
    <br>He is my cousin.
    <br>My aunty has said it all; he has all the addictions - smoking, drinking, the school issues.
    <br>She has said it all.
    <br>We see that it is just the evil spirit inside him.
    <br>Ministration Of The Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Speak out! How many of you are inside this body?
    <br>How many of you demons are inside this body?
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>How many?
    <br>We are many.
    <br>Who is the second person?
    <br>Confusion.
    <br>How have you, Confusion, affected his education?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>You demon, how did you enter him?
    <br>Through friends.
    <br>What was he doing with his friends that allowed you to enter?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>He liked to party.
    <br>What did they use to do at those parties?
    <br>They drink, smoke and do all sorts of evil.
    <br>When he smokes and drinks, what happens to him?
    <br>Everything goes to his head.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Right now, through this medium of the Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>it's time for you to go, in the name of Jesus Christ!

    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Congratulations, the Lord has set you free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! We are grateful. My family is grateful. Thank You.
    <br>We thank God Almighty, but we know that it was the evil spirit
    <br>that was causing him to do all this smoking and drinking.
    <br>So we advise you, sir, to make the Bible the standard for your life
    <br>so that you would be able to maintain this deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Jeffery.
    <br>Besides me are my father, my mum and my aunty.
    <br>Jeffery & Family
    <br>Nigeria
    <br>Go ahead with your testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My testimony goes like this.
    <br>When I was 18 years of age, I went to my friend's house and he asked me if I was hungry.
    <br>I gave him money to buy noodles which he prepared.
    <br>Inside the noodles, I saw this green leaf - it was very long; I wondered what it was.
    <br>He said that it was just thyme.
    <br>I thought it was fine since we were all going to eat the food together.
    <br>Then, we started eating the food and I noticed that I was acting strangely.
    <br>I took it as nothing because we were all feeling the same way.
    <br>I asked him what he had put in the food and he replied it was just thyme,
    <br>that I should just eat and be happy.
    <br>It got to a point where it was too much for me - my head felt very light.
    <br>Then, he said it was time for me to go home. He took me to the house.
    <br>On my way, we branched to the pharmacy and he got me a particular medication
    <br>used to clear your eyes when you are very high, when your eyes are very red
    <br>so that people wouldn't know you were high.
    <br>You could just act all cool and stay calm.
    <br>After all that, the next day, I met him again and asked, "Can I get an upgrade?
    <br>Instead of eating it, could I do something else with it?"
    <br>He said, "Sure, I could smoke it."
    <br>He showed me how to roll the weed and I started smoking it from then until I entered university.
    <br>While in university, I met some friends.
    <br>They told me that they smoked, drank and did drugs and asked me what I did.
    <br>I said I just smoked and they said it was fine and that we should smoke together.
    <br>We left lectures, went to the back of the school and started smoking.
    <br>Then, a brother ordered drugs and I started taking painkillers from then.
    <br>After the painkillers, they introduced me to cocaine but I refused to take it,
    <br>codeine and other stuff.
    <br>All this happened while I was in university.
    <br>With this, I stopped going to school and I started looking for money to buy drugs
    <br>because I needed drugs to stay high and focused.
    <br>I had been deceived that I was taking drugs to get focused.
    <br>It is a big deceit because you cannot achieve what you want to achieve when you are high.
    <br>It is not possible because it wastes your time.
    <br>Once you decided, "I will smoke today", that was all. I would get high and life continued.
    <br>I smoked every day.
    <br>In the morning, when I woke up, I smoked.
    <br>I would take a bath. Then, after food, I would smoke.
    <br>In the afternoon, I would smoke.
    <br>Every single day, before going to school, I smoked;
    <br>I always got high before I went for lectures.
    <br>During the lectures, it was either I was sleeping or chatting with my friends.
    <br>I just focused away from my schooling.
    <br>With that, I started stealing.
    <br>I started stealing my parents' stuff and selling things from the house like my parents' jewellery.
    <br>I started taking what was not mine just to buy drugs and get high.
    <br>It was something that I could not stop.
    <br>I was looking for a better way of stealing.
    <br>I met this friend of mine who told me that he could help me join a cult.
    <br>I would get boys who would be at my back and I would be under them for protection.
    <br>I told the guy that I was not sure about it and wanted to think about it for a while.
    <br>He kept on asking me that question but I would always dodge him,
    <br>to the extent that I stopped going to the guy's place but each time he saw me on the road,
    <br>he would ask me what my answer was to what we had talked about.
    <br>I would tell him that I was still thinking about it, that the next time we met I would talk about it.
    <br>I felt that being in a cult was not really necessary because I had my parents.
    <br>Fine, they might say I was too soft or something.
    <br>I could just stay on my own without being in a cult, going for robberies
    <br>or doing whatever they did.
    <br>I avoided the guy.
    <br>The spirit brought in confusion and made me do away with my school fees.
    <br>It made me destroy my parents' business and took away the glory of the family.
    <br>I went for parties where we would scam people over the internet.
    <br>Actually, the spirit made me to hate school and everything about reading.
    <br>I never saw myself reading; I was not the reading type.
    <br>I just didn't like school.
    <br>Now, tell us how you finally came to The SCOAN for your deliverance.
    <br>After watching Emmanuel TV for a long while, I was very close to my aunt and I told her
    <br>how I had been seeing people being delivered on Emmanuel TV and I needed deliverance too.
    <br>That morning, I was begging her although I don't like going to church,
    <br>I begged her to take me to church. She said fine and that I should dress up.
    <br>Then, she brought me here.
    <br>While the Morning Water was being ministered, I wasn't myself.
    <br>I got lost in a trance.
    <br>After your deliverance, what can you say about your new life?
    <br>My life has been peaceful ever since.
    <br>I don't smoke anymore.
    <br>I don't have the urge to take drugs anymore.
    <br>I am just happy with myself.
    <br>I just feel good right now.
    <br>Thanks to God, I am happy that I am delivered.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Jeffery & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>We would like to listen to your parents. Let's hear from your dad.
    <br>Sir, tell us your name and whom the young man is to you
    <br>and what you have to say concerning his previous character.
    <br>Emmanuel!!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Emmanuel.
    <br>The boy standing here is my son, Jeffery.
    <br>Jeffery used to be a very brilliant son of mine.
    <br>All this began when he entered into the final year of secondary school.
    <br>A boy that is inclined scientifically, does a lot of things with computers and telephones.
    <br>Most of the time, when I have issues to do with my laptop
    <br>or anything that has to do with computers, what I do is call him to put me through.
    <br>I was just very happy the way he was going but all of a sudden,
    <br>when he wanted to choose the subjects for his final year in secondary school,
    <br>which ought to have been sciences, the boy automatically changed to art subjects.
    <br>I asked him if he had been doing art subjects before and he said no but that he loved doing art.
    <br>He said that art was his desire and that he loved to act and draw -
    <br>that was what he wanted to do.
    <br>I was surprised - a boy who was doing very well in his academics in science subjects,
    <br>all of a sudden decided to change to arts.
    <br>The teachers at his school called me and asked if I was aware of what my son wanted to do.
    <br>I said yes and that I had asked him but one thing that I would never do,
    <br>was to stop him from doing the course that he wanted to do.
    <br>What I would do was just to ask him to confirm that this was what he wanted to do.
    <br>Then, I would back him up.
    <br>That was what I did in that aspect.
    <br>I kept asking questions but he said that that was what he wanted to do.
    <br>I told him not to worry, that I would back him up
    <br>and that whatever he did, he should come out to be the best.
    <br>He started out that way.
    <br>When he got admission into university, we asked him to try as much as possible to live on campus
    <br>But unfortunately, he couldn't get accommodation on campus;
    <br>so, he had to come from home.
    <br>Every day, Jeffery would collect money from me to go to school.
    <br>One thing I observed at that time was that he went out every day
    <br>but would come back between 9:30pm - 10:00pm, every day.
    <br>Sometimes, he would sleep and sleep.
    <br>At around 10 o'clock, I would go to his room and asked him if he was still sleeping
    <br>and if he wasn't going to school or having lectures that day.
    <br>He would tell me, "Daddy, my lecture is in the afternoon".
    <br>I would ask why other kids were in school while only he attended class in the afternoon.
    <br>I was a little bit scared and angry with him.
    <br>This continued.
    <br>It was to the extent that one day, I saw him as he came in and his eyes were red.
    <br>I tried to find out what had happened to him.
    <br>He said that he was okay, only that he was having a slight headache
    <br>which was why his eyes were red.
    <br>I prayed with him and told him that whenever he comes back, he should come and see me
    <br>so that I would be able to know exactly what was wrong with him.
    <br>But one thing Jeffery did was never to come back to me at any point in time.
    <br>He tried to keep away from me.
    <br>Whenever he came back so late, he would never bother to come upstairs and see me.
    <br>He would just go to his room and that was it.
    <br>Sometimes, when you put food on the table, Jeffery would not eat.
    <br>The next day, the way you left that food was how it would be.
    <br>I began to ask what the problem was - did he have someone taking care of him in school?
    <br>He would say he was okay, he was fine. That was how Jeffery had been.
    <br>I noticed a lot of changes but the only thing was that he never told the truth.
    <br>At any point in time, when you asked him a question, he had one thing or the other to tell you.
    <br>As a deacon in my church, I always told him that the truth of the matter was that it is good for you
    <br>to be truthful in life so that somebody would be able to help you when you had problems.
    <br>But as a man, when you grow in the life of not telling the truth often,
    <br>nobody will know when you have needs, problems - people will never take you serious.
    <br>That was one thing I tried to minister to him but I found that at any point in time,
    <br>Jeffery kept on telling lies, which is not of God. I always cautioned him.
    <br>But to God be the glory, I was very happy that he was delivered.
    <br>One thing that I want to tell people is that - my son, Jeffery used to be a nice boy.
    <br>Sometimes, when he went out with friends, he didn't even bother to know who his friends were.
    <br>I would say that assuming I had followed him up as a parent,
    <br>I would have known who his friends were.
    <br>It would have been better for him to bring his friends home and let us talk to them
    <br>and know exactly what they were into.
    <br>Some of them might not be the best for him but at least, I would had been able to guide him
    <br>and say, "This friend is not good for you to walk with, do this,
    <br>look for people that have the fear of God so that they can help increase your spiritual life".
    <br>But Jeffery never brought his friends home; his friends were always outside.
    <br>Whenever he wanted to go out, he went out;
    <br>whenever he wanted to come back, he came back.
    <br>Whenever we asked him questions, he went straight to tell us, "I am fine".
    <br>Who are your friends? He will say my friends are there.
    <br>He said, "Daddy, I will never fail you" up 'til today, he had failed the whole family.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>We thank God for the deliverance your son has received but we just want to ask you,
    <br>there was a time you said that he used to sleep and kept telling you that he had lectures in the afternoon.
    <br>Did you inquire from anybody whether he was actually in school or not?
    <br>Yes. Whenever Jeffery slept and I went to wake him up for school,
    <br>I had people that I thought I had handed Jeffery over to at school to look after him.
    <br>One of them was a lecturer there.
    <br>I said, "Listen, my friend, you are there. I believe as a father, you are there with Jeffery.
    <br>Please, guide Jeffery and teach Jeffery the right thing to do".
    <br>Also, Jeffery's immediate younger sister was at the same school as him.
    <br>That one was always very serious and never came home.
    <br>With Jeffery, I had tried as much as possible to give him a reason to stay in school and read.
    <br>He preferred to come from the house.
    <br>Every morning I go out to my business and come back as late as six or seven in the evening.
    <br>By then, he would have gone out to school.
    <br>I was not monitoring him the way I ought to have because every morning, I go out for my business.
    <br>He too pretended to go to school, but he never did.
    <br>That was the problem.
    <br>Also, sir, did you ask how he was doing in school from those people you handed him over to?
    <br>Sometimes when I asked him, he said Jeffery was doing well.
    <br>Also, his sister always told me that Jeffery was fine but that the only thing was that
    <br>his friends were complaining that Jeffery did not attend lectures.
    <br>That was when we knew that things had got so bad.
    <br>When I asked Jeffery if he went to school, he would say that he went to school.
    <br>I would ask, "How was school?". He would say that it was beautiful, fine.
    <br>I would ask him where his books were.
    <br>At least, somebody who went to school was supposed to have handouts,
    <br>textbooks and other reading materials.
    <br>Jeffery never read.
    <br>At any point in time, when you asked him a question, he would say, "Daddy, don't worry.
    <br>This is a scientific world now; everything is on the systems. We go to the systems to read"
    <br>and he said that he was going to make it better.
    <br>Up until now, he did not read his books but I thank God that since his deliverance,
    <br>Jeffery stays at home instead of always going out.
    <br>I went to him and asked, "Jeffery, what do you want to do?"
    <br>He would say, "Daddy, I want to relax or look at one thing or the other".
    <br>This makes me so happy now.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We just want to hear from you, sir, what effort have you made to find a solution to the problem of your son?
    <br>As a deacon in my church, I mostly have pastors as my friends.
    <br>Most of the time, some of them come to the house to pray for us.
    <br>Whenever we needed them, they always came.
    <br>They always told me that Jeffery had an issue, a problem
    <br>but no one could really tell what it was.
    <br>I took it up myself and fasted most of the time.
    <br>Even the week that he came for deliverance, I was fasting for five days because of him.
    <br>I had tried all that I could to make this boy change.
    <br>When I prayed, he didn't even seem to understand why one should pray.
    <br>Sometimes, I called him to come but to him, it seemed I was a time waster.
    <br>To him, being in the presence of God was time wasting.
    <br>Jeffery never even followed me.
    <br>Whenever I called him to come to church, what he would do was to run to the toilet.
    <br>He would either tell me that he was stooling, his tummy was disturbing him.
    <br>He would stay there; I would sound my car horn and shout but he would never come out.
    <br>Out of annoyance, I would leave him and go to church.
    <br>And finally, he came to The SCOAN.
    <br>By the grace of God, he was delivered from this spirit that gave him several bad habits.
    <br>What changes have you noticed ever since he received deliverance here at The SCOAN?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Since Jeffery came for deliverance, his life has totally changed.
    <br>One thing I noticed was this: Jeffery never woke up early to do the things he ought to do
    <br>without me forcing him.
    <br>Since his deliverance, when he wakes up, he goes straight to the parlour,
    <br>opens the windows and sweeps.
    <br>He goes to the cars, even the ones I don't want to use, and washes them for me,
    <br>which he had never done.
    <br>As old as Jeffery is, one always had to tell him, "Do this", before he did something
    <br>at any point in time.
    <br>He never took the initiative to do something on his own.
    <br>Since his deliverance, he has been so calm; he stays at home
    <br>and has not been going out for a few days now.
    <br>Things have really changed.
    <br>When I speak with him, the way he responds to the questions tells me that
    <br>something has happened in his life.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>How is his prayer life now?
    <br>Previously, when I called Jeffery to get up to pray and do our morning devotion,
    <br>everybody would be out but Jeffery would not join us.
    <br>But now, when we just start upstairs - he is downstairs - when he hears my voice,
    <br>he wakes up by himself and joins us in prayer.
    <br>Now, he is more focused.
    <br>I have heard him pray out loud but before, he could not.
    <br>When you asked him to pray, he would just be murmuring.
    <br>I would say, "What are you murmuring?
    <br>Why not voice out and let me hear what you are saying? Pray out so that we can hear you well".
    <br>But then, he didn't do that and you could not force him.
    <br>Whatever you asked him to do, he would choose to do what he wanted.
    <br>But now, he prays out loud and I have heard him praising God,
    <br>singing to praise and worship His holy name.
    <br>Praise the name of the Lord!
    <br>Let's put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>We believe your wife has one or two things to say concerning this deliverance
    <br>and this testimony.
    <br>Madam, tell us your name and who the brother is to you
    <br>and what you have to say.
    <br>My name is Phillipias.
    <br>The boy standing beside me is my son, Jeffery.

    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>What can you say about his deliverance?
    <br>I thank God that after his deliverance, my son is calm. His character has changed.
    <br>He is always indoors; he's not going outside.

    <br>We also want to hear from the aunty that brought Jeffery here for deliverance.
    <br>Sister, ever since he received deliverance, I believe you have seen
    <br>one or two changes in his life.
    <br>Tell us what you can say about Jeffery now.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Promise.
    <br>Looking at Jeffery now, he looks fresh. That is one of the things.
    <br>Unlike when he was dry and I kept asking what was drying him up.
    <br>You would see those veins; they would just shoot out like that.
    <br>He would always frown his face but now, he is happy.
    <br>He said, "Aunty, God has visited me" and God has visited him.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>Indeed, God has visited this family and to God be the glory
    <br>they are here to share the wonderful testimony of the power of God
    <br>through this medium of Morning Water.
    <br>We just want to hear your advice to viewers.
    <br>We would start with the father first.
    <br>Sir, tell us the advice you have for viewers all over the world.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The advice I have for viewers watching us this morning -
    <br>I would say that it is not all just about having children
    <br>but I would advise every parent to create time for their children.
    <br>Monitor them, who their friends are, know how they move.
    <br>Don't only send them to school and say, "Yes, I have paid their school fees,
    <br>I have given them all they required".
    <br>You, as a father, you, as a mother have to create time to visit them and know what they are doing -
    <br>Whether they are really attending lectures and still doing that which they ought to do.
    <br>Most especially, as children of God, parents who were brought up in the Christian way,
    <br>try to make sure that your ward belongs to a Christian fellowship on campus.
    <br>That is the only thing that will help them in life.
    <br>I can remember when I was in university, I had my prayer groups
    <br>and every day, we were involved in one programme or the other.
    <br>But these children never do that.
    <br>The duty of parents is this: make sure you monitor your ward,
    <br>make sure you know whom their friends are, interview their friends,
    <br>know the quality of friends they have, even the ones you can ascertain that this one is good,
    <br>make sure you know the background of that friend so if anything goes wrong,
    <br>you know where to start from.
    <br>I think their friends are very paramount.
    <br>Please, parents, be watchful whom your children are friends with.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah! Viewers all over the world, you have heard it.
    <br>We also want to hear from Jeffery himself.
    <br>What advice do you have for viewers, particularly to youths who have the same habit
    <br>you had in the past.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice for the youth all over the world, having the same problem that I had
    <br>is to watch the kind of friends you keep.
    <br>There is a saying that show me your friends and I will tell you who you are.
    <br>It is so true.
    <br>You just have to watch the kind of friends you keep and the kind of movements you make.
    <br>It is not all friends who tell you something is good that is actually good;
    <br>they are there to deceive you.
    <br>The devil is real and he wants us  to go down;
    <br>he doesn't want us to shine the way God wants us to shine.
    <br>My advice for you is believe in God because right now,
    <br>I am really happy being in the presence of the Lord.
    <br>I feel really...
    <br>Jeffery & Family 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Words are not enough for him to explain how he is actually feeling right now.
    <br>So we thank God that God Almighty has used this medium of Morning Water to set you free.
    <br>The advice from Prophet T.B. Joshua is that you and your family
    <br>should go and make God's Word the standard for your lives
    <br>so that this kind of deliverance would remain permanent in your lives in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
