  <p>    
    <br>We are about to offer a mass prayer.
    <br>Mass prayer we are about to offer is like "each hand will be on one's side".
    <br>You will receive a hand while the prayer will be going on.
    <br>Not only people here but viewers at their homes, all over the world.
    <br>You have the presence of a "touch" on you.
    <br>What is about to happen now... after that you are stamped and sealed.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>I don't want you to miss it.
    <br>I have held many revivals all over the world.
    <br>I witnessed the Spirit of Father descend but not remain on everyone.
    <br>Not that the Spirit will not come down - no.
    <br>Who is calling that Spirit?
    <br>His servant.
    <br>When you see this revival, you will know it is a revival.
    <br>People of all colours.
    <br>Not just "one-sided people": white or black or... no.
    <br>People of all colours, accepting themselves, worshipping together - that is revival.
    <br>Just because I am from this country, I should not go to that country and call my people,
    <br>to join me for the revival.
    <br>This is revival I held - several of them all over the world.
    <br>I witnessed the Spirit of God descend but not remain on some people.
    <br>It remained on some.
    <br>He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>You can check yourself if you have this kind of a character.
    <br>You see people falling down...
    <br>You see people vomiting...
    <br>You may have a similar situation but you will be looking until the whole thing is finished.
    <br>He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(He does not remain when He is grieved.)
    <br>I mean, the Spirit of Father, God, our Lord Jesus – He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>He will come down.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down.
    <br>The voice is gone.
    <br>To where?
    <br>To Heaven.
    <br>The Heaven will be checking whose voice is this.
    <br>Oh yes - this is our servant.
    <br>OK, let's go.
    <br>They follow the voice again, down.
    <br>Atmosphere changes.
    <br>Heaven will be looking for people that are ready for Him.
    <br>He does not remain in people when He is grieved.
    <br>You have to take note of this.
    <br>Your pastor is calling the congregation for prayer - you should be ready.
    <br>If he successfully called the Holy Ghost, he can not detain Him.
    <br>He can only call and the Holy Ghost will go and look at those who are really ready for Him.
    <br>He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride and we express our pride in different, various ways.
    <br>Everybody knows that when the man is very proud he looks like this.
    <br>You say:
    <br>- That man is proud.
    <br>- Where?
    <br>- The one coming up.
    <br>You will see a man like this.
    <br>That man is very proud - he will look like this.
    <br>Is it not true?
    <br>You see it as a pride but you don't know that there are different ways we can express our pride.
    <br>It is not the only way.
    <br>There are different ways we can express it.
    <br>Any moment from now you will see what will be happening.
    <br>You will hear some people laughing at others, "Oh my God, look at this person, who fell back".
    <br>But he himself did not fall.
    <br>If you don't fall and somebody does, why do you comment about this person who fell?
    <br>It is not a joke.
    <br>This is a church of God.
    <br>Get yourself ready.
    <br>Let the Spirit of Father remain in you.
    <br>He wants to be Himself in you; He does not want you to instruct Him.
    <br>He wants to be Himself in you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(He wants to be Himself in you.)
    <br>Again.
    <br>(He wants to be Himself in you.)
    <br>Again.
    <br>(He wants to be Himself in you.)
    <br>He wants to be Himself in you.
    <br>Though He is using your shape, organs, body, yet, He wants to be Himself.
    <br>What are your challenges?
    <br>What are the issues of grieve?
    <br>When I hold a grudge against you, I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(When I hold a grudge against you, I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.)
    <br>Again.
    <br>(When I hold a grudge against you, I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.)
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, for any reason, as a Christian - once I hold a grudge against you,
    <br>I have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Are you holding a grudge?
    <br>Pain of the past?
    <br>Feel free now; just say in your heart and mean it, "I forgive that man. I forgive that woman."
    <br>Begin to bless your people.
    <br>Bless them.
    <br>It is over my way - no, I am sorry, God.
    <br>Lord, forgive me as I forgive those who have sinned against me.
    <br>So, begin now, before we call Heaven.
    <br>When Heaven comes down, the Spirit of Father, He does not remain in a man who holds a grudge.
    <br>That is why you need to clear yourself now.
    <br>The blind man who couldn't see, will begin to say, "I can see!"
    <br>You will say, "Everything is happening around me. Is it arranged? Over there. Vomit, blood, worms, insects.
    <br>What's wrong? This does not work for me."
    <br>When Heaven – that is, the Spirit of Father – comes, He does not work in a man who holds a grudge.
    <br>He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>We can only grieve Him when we hold a grudge against our brother.
    <br>Everyone holds grudges.
    <br>There is no single person here than can stand and say, "No, I'm free from this".
    <br>People will tell you they had been wounded, unjustly treated:
    <br>"I am innocent but this is what they have done to me. I am not happy."
    <br>You are holding a grudge; not on anyone else but on yourself.
    <br>Your spirit can never be free when you are not happy.
    <br>You have seen God as reliable.
    <br>When you know God is reliable, what happens next?
    <br>You begin to trust in Him!
    <br>That is the meaning of ‘reliable’.
    <br>The moment you realise He is reliable, you begin to trust in Him and depend on Him.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>We are here to stand against anything that is not of God.
    <br>Those things are the cause of the crisis and challenges you are having today.
    <br>Therefore, let God Himself, Jesus, give us a Word to say.
    <br>If I allow you to begin to pray...
    <br>There are a lot of things you want to pray for.
    <br>They are too many.
    <br>You say, "I rebuke this one"...
    <br>There are a lot of things you want to rebuke.
    <br>We don’t know how to pray; the Holy Spirit gives us a Word.
    <br>When He gives us the Word in prayer, it becomes prayer language.
    <br>Prayer what?
    <br>(Language.)
    <br>You don't know prayer has its own language.
    <br>Holy Spirit, give me a Word; I don't know how to pray - the Holy Spirit gives me.
    <br>There is a barrier between you and God.
    <br>There is a wall, that does not allow you to even see, hear or feel the realm, the presence of God.
    <br>Something is between you and God.
    <br>That is a barrier.
    <br>It could be holding grudges, trials, an unforgiving spirit or pain in the past.
    <br>You refuse to let it go.
    <br>If you don’t let yesterday go, you can’t enjoy today.
    <br>That is what you have in the school - the carry-over.
    <br>That language is not good - carry-over.
    <br>Many of us are full of yesterday and we want to enjoy today – it’s not possible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You are full of yesterday and we want to enjoy today – it’s not possible.
    <br>To be full of yesterday it to think about your past.
    <br>If what you are full of are good things of yesterday, you can enjoy today.
    <br>But they are not good things; the bad of it is what you are thinking about.
    <br>It will not allow you to enjoy today.
    <br>Take just good of yesterday and be full of that good.
    <br>You want to enjoy today but you remember the bad, how you were disappointed, how your job wasn't going well.
    <br>These are the problems you are facing.
    <br>You can release yourself.
    <br>These are the causes of the barrier.
    <br>OK.
    <br>You know, Jesus loves you.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>If your confess that Jesus loves you, I want to hear you clear.
    <br>(Jesus loves me.)
    <br>Yes, I'm happy to hear that.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to rebuke every satanic covenant of attitude and character!
    <br>Begin to rebuke it.

    <br>My name is Ms. Inkeshi Agbe (?)
    <br>For last six years I had ceased menstruation.
    <br>As the man of God, senior Prophet T.B. Joshua was rendering prayer, I felt a sensation in my stomach.
    <br>I rushed to the restroom.

    <br>To the glory of God, the bloodied stains on the tissue paper prove that indeed her ceased menstruation
    <br>has been gloriously restored.
    <br>I just entered the restroom and discovered that the menstruation is coming out very well.
    <br>This problem of ceased menstruation has taken me to different hospitals.
    <br>Even the doctors from the hospital told me that there was no hope to see a period.
    <br>Watch your screen.

    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
