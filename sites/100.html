    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities which cause crises in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua, together in the name of Jesus, can stop satan
    <br>killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen right now.
    <br>Engage with God.
    <br>Father, Lord Jesus!
    <br>Anywhere you are all over the world, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>I say to your soul, body and spirit, to all your faculties,
    <br>receive the blessing of God!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>What are your challenges within and outside of your body,
    <br>in your blood, fluid, tendons, bones, muscles, in all your faculties?
    <br>Wherever is the challenge, pain, sickness, affliction, infirmity -
    <br>I don't know but Jesus knows this.
    <br>Receive cure!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Listen to the voice of your bones.
    <br>Your bones, blood, tendons and faculties are saying, "I am healed".
    <br>This is the voice of your bones.
    <br>If your bones say they are healed,
    <br>if your faculties, bones, tendons and muscles are saying they are healed,
    <br>what are you doing on the sickbed?
    <br>Why are you still lying down there?
    <br>Rise up!
    <br>I am healed! This is the voice of your bones.
    <br>Your tendon says, "I am healed!"
    <br>I can hear from your blood, "I am healed!"
    <br>I can hear from your bones, "I am healed!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Sin's power over you - affliction,
    <br>sin's power over you - immorality,
    <br>sin's power over you - disobedience,
    <br>sin's power over your life - unfaithfulness,
    <br>sin's power over your life - anger,
    <br>sin's power over your life - idolatry,
    <br>sin's power over your life - greed,
    <br>sin's power over your life - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God as you send your testimony.
    <br>Engage with God.
