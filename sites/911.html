  <p>    
    <br>How are you, brother?
    <br>Where is your wife?
    <br>That's my wife.
    <br>There's a problem in the house.
    <br>That's very correct. That's why we are here.
    <br>When the two of you sit together, there is a big problem.
    <br>That's very correct, Prophet.
    <br>For the past three months now, this house has not been in order.
    <br>That's a hundred percent correct, Prophet!
    <br>It's like a cat and a rat living together.
    <br>One hundred percent. I can't say anymore.
    <br>You have to help this auntie. You have to help her.
    <br>Okay, Prophet.
    <br>You just have to help her.
    <br>Okay, Prophet.
    <br>So, don't use the family she comes from against her
    <br>because she comes from a disorganised family.
    <br>Okay, Prophet.
    <br>You are a prophet!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Leaving this woman - it will affect you
    <br>because she is a woman that God has given you.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet.
    <br>You were bleeding in the past.
    <br>Yes, Prophet. That's very true.
    <br>What was the cause of the bleeding?
    <br>I have two fibroids in my womb.
    <br>Apart from fibroids.
    <br>I used to have an imbalance in my hormones so when the doctor tried to correct it, then --
    <br>Because I'm seeing bleeding, bleeding, bleeding.
    <br>Yes, it's very true.
    <br>I want to see you people - and you don't have affection for this woman.
    <br>It is not her that does not have affection; you don't have affection.
    <br>I don't know what the problem is, Prophet.
    <br>It's very true, Man of God; he doesn't have.
    <br>She loves you, she wants you, she wants to show love but you - you say, "Go and wait there!"
    <br>That's very true.
    <br>She has now turned to somebody you employed, not even your wife.
    <br>I think I need to see you.
    <br>Thank you very much, Prophet!
    <br>You're a nice man.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>She's my mother-in-law, Prophet. She lives with us.
    <br>There is trouble in their house.
    <br>Don't worry. I have said it already.
    <br>You know the young people today - they don't want you to interfere in their family.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>Everything will be alright.
    <br>My name is Chakoi.
    <br>I'm a Cameroonian by nationality but I live with my husband in Namibia.
    <br>This is my husband; his name is Helms.
    <br>This is my step-daughter, Emma.
    <br>This is my son, Helms Junior.
    <br>This is my mother, Katrine.
    <br>The prophecy that the man of God gave to us last Sunday was very true.
    <br>For the last three months, there have been serious problems in our house;
    <br>a lot of disagreements.
    <br>My husband asked me to pack my things and leave the house.
    <br>The problem we were having in the house was centred on my step-daughter,
    <br>the care of my step-daughter.
    <br>Actually, when my husband brought me to Namibia, everything was fine.
    <br>I came and met him in the house with a baby so I took the baby as my own baby.
    <br>So, as we were living and things were going on,
    <br>I finally discovered that there were things that were not very right in the life of this child.
    <br>Ok, before you go any further.
    <br>You were talking about a step-daughter. Could you tell us the daughter you are talking about?
    <br>This is my step-daughter; she is right here.
    <br>She is five years and about ten months old.
    <br>So, when I came and met her in Namibia, she just turned three.
    <br>Everything was fine until I started noticing some things in the child that are not correct.
    <br>The child was so unruly.
    <br>When I tried to put things right in the life of the child, it was very difficult.
    <br>Another thing that I noticed with the baby was that
    <br>the baby does not like for us to have prayers in the house,
    <br>she does not like the reading of the Bible, she does not like to go to church and all of that.
    <br>I was concerned about it and told my husband
    <br>that these things are not normal for a little baby like this.
    <br>So, I took her to several men of God for prayers.
    <br>They also confirmed to me that the baby was possessed.
    <br>So, they prayed for her and gave me anointing oil which I was using on the baby.
    <br>There were other attitudes in the child.
    <br>Nobody wants to bring up a child that is spoilt.
    <br>She was spoilt and the thing that marvelled me was how she talked at her age,
    <br>the way she would act and behave; it was not correct.
    <br>I tried to put things right; she was so unruly.
    <br>In the process of putting these things together,
    <br>my husband was seeing it as if I was not treating the child well.
    <br>As time went on, I came to discover that they segregated themselves from me.
    <br>When they were together, they were talking and laughing.
    <br>When I came close to them, they stayed quiet.
    <br>When they moved to another place and were talking, when I came, they would stay quiet.
    <br>When I left, they would start talking; when I came, they would stay quiet.
    <br>My presence was not really comfortable for them.
    <br>So I told them that I didn't have company in this house, I need company in the house.
    <br>If you people don't give me company, fine.
    <br>I will pray to God. When God will give me my own company, you people should not complain.
    <br>So you people should continue enjoying yourselves
    <br>but know that when God gives me my own company, nobody should complain.
    <br>In the course of time, I also had my own baby.
    <br>So when I shifted attention now to my own baby, my husband said that
    <br>I'm showing discrimination; there cannot be two children in the house
    <br>with one getting all the love, the other one not getting all the love.
    <br>I said, you are the ones that showed me that; you put me on one side.
    <br>So I don't have company; my company is here.
    <br>So let me enjoy my own company too.
    <br>Another issue of serious concern was that when I was about 4 months pregnant,
    <br>one morning --
    <br>I used to get up in the morning, prepare her and take her to school, and bring her back.
    <br>Even in the process of trying to make her become cultured because she was so uncultured.
    <br>She uses abusive language and all of that.
    <br>She does not hear this from us in the house so I tried to put things in order in her life.
    <br>One morning I was sick; I was not feeling fine.
    <br>So I got up; the housemaid prepared the baby.
    <br>She then told me, "The baby is ready. Please come and carry the baby to school".
    <br>I said, "Please, I'm very sick. Take taxi money and carry the baby to school".
    <br>She was taking the baby to school and told the baby, "We are going to school in a taxi".
    <br>The baby said, "There cannot be two cars" - I mean, at the age of four.
    <br>The baby said, "There cannot be two cars in my father's compound
    <br>and I'm going to school in a taxi.
    <br>Go and tell that woman to get out of that bed and take me to school".
    <br>The thing got on my nerves; I was like, what is this?
    <br>What kind of unruliness is this?
    <br>So I said, "As a point of discipline, you are only going to go to school in a taxi.
    <br>Your nanny will take you to school and bring you back from school
    <br>so that tomorrow when there is no car in the house, you will know that you have to take taxi".
    <br>My husband was seeing that as if I was maltreating the child, sending the child away from him.
    <br>All of these things came into play.
    <br>He was kind of wondering.
    <br>With the new baby, now I'm happy and rejoicing.
    <br>I look at my baby and smile.
    <br>Since the child is not comfortable in my presence, so she will also keep her own distance.
    <br>So the distance made my husband to become very uncomfortable.
    <br>Three months ago, he told me that my step-daughter was not happy
    <br>since she saw the baby entering the house.
    <br>That if I didn't make things right in the house,
    <br>with the baby not being comfortable in my presence, I should pack my things and leave
    <br>because he was not going to sit down and watch
    <br>and stay in a house where the wife is this way with her child, and the step-daughter this way.
    <br>He didn't know how to manage the situation
    <br>so the best thing was for me to pack my things and go.
    <br>So I said, "Okay, fine".
    <br>With the course of time, he decided to bring me to The SCOAN
    <br>so that the man of God should handle our case
    <br>because it was more than him; he didn't know what to do.
    <br>Ok. In the course of sharing your experience with us, you made us to understand
    <br>that it got to a state whereby you had to start taking your step-daughter from one prayer house to another.
    <br>Could you tell us the reason why you were going from one prayer house to another
    <br>and what was your impression right at that point in time?
    <br>The thing that was surprising to me was that
    <br>even when you were reading the Bible in the house, she would tell you, "Don't read that book here.
    <br>I don't want you to read that book. Is that the only book you can read in this house?"
    <br>If you took her to church, she didn't want to go to church.
    <br>"Come and let's pray." - "No."
    <br>You said you took her from one prayer house to another.
    <br>Could you tell us - what was your impression about your step-daughter?
    <br>From what the men of God were saying, the impression was that the baby is possessed.
    <br>So I don't hide anything from my husband.
    <br>I came and told my husband, "Please, this is what I've been told. This is what is happening.
    <br>So what do you think?".
    <br>There were times that even when I pointed out something that was not right with the child,
    <br>my husband would get so angry with me that he would not talk to me for two weeks.
    <br>Ok. Finally, you are here in The SCOAN. What do you want now?
    <br>What is want is that the man of God should say something about the baby and our marriage
    <br>because I'm here for the man of God to help me.
    <br>This man wants me out of his house.
    <br>Ok. Let's hear from your husband.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Helms Atud & Family - Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Good morning everybody!
    <br>My name is Helms Atud.
    <br>I'm a Cameroonian living in Namibia with my family.
    <br>This is my wife Chakoi.
    <br>This is my daughter from another relationship that didn't go well.
    <br>When the child was ten months old, the mother tried to commit suicide and abandoned the baby.
    <br>The government gave this baby to me.
    <br>Later on, I had full custody of the child.
    <br>I have been living with her since the age of ten months.
    <br>That is our son Helms Junior, and my mother-in-law Katrine.
    <br>When we were here on last Sunday,
    <br>I was one of the first people the Spirit of God located through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I was seated right over there. He came to me and said, "How are you, sir?"
    <br>I said, "I'm fine". He asked, "Where is your wife?"
    <br>I said, "There is my wife". He said, "There is a problem in your home.
    <br>For the past three months, you have been living like cat and mouse at home.
    <br>There is no peace in your home.
    <br>Your wife loves you. This is a woman God has given you but there is no affection from your side".
    <br>And he asked me to try and help my wife.
    <br>Those were the prophecies, and I confirm these prophecies to be true.
    <br>As my wife said, three months ago we had an argument
    <br>and I told her if we cannot solve this problem in our home, I cannot live like this anymore.
    <br>That was in August. And I told her very clearly that there is August, September, October.
    <br>By the end of October, if we cannot find a solution, I will be renting an apartment
    <br>and she will go and stay with the little boy and I will stay with the girl in the house.
    <br>How did this come about?
    <br>When my wife came from Cameroon,
    <br>I had already explained the situation of this little girl to her in Cameroon.
    <br>So when she moved over and we got married, we were living happily.
    <br>It was just honeymoon, seriously.
    <br>Six, seven, eight months down the road, my wife was not getting pregnant.
    <br>She started getting very worried.
    <br>She started praying, fasting for seven days.
    <br>I have never seen it; seven days, day and night, she would eat and drink nothing,
    <br>just praying for the fruit of the womb.
    <br>I told her that God will give us a child at His own time.
    <br>That did not end there.
    <br>My wife now started praying with a lot of pastors - too many pastors.
    <br>They were giving too many revelations.
    <br>One of the revelations was: The reason she was not conceiving is because this child is possessed.
    <br>Now, this is a child I had been living with since ten months.
    <br>I didn't know anything about that.
    <br>I said, "Fine. Tell the pastor to come to our house.
    <br>As we see on Emmanuel TV, when somebody is possessed, they deliver the person".
    <br>This pastor came, stayed with us, asked me to get salt, olive oil and a breakable plate.
    <br>That they will do deliverance in the middle of the night.
    <br>He came in the middle of the night and did the deliverance.
    <br>To be honest, I thought that was it.
    <br>The pastor left and went back the next day.
    <br>But this problem still continued.
    <br>At that point now, there was tension between my wife and the little girl,
    <br>and it was creating a distance.
    <br>Three or four months went by.
    <br>Still prayer, fasting, prophecies, revelations - it was every day.
    <br>One morning my wife got up and said to me that she couldn't find her wedding ring.
    <br>She went to bed with the wedding ring but now she cannot find it.
    <br>It has been removed from her hand. I said, "What do you mean?
    <br>You might have forgotten it in the bedroom. Just check around".
    <br>A prophecy came from that situation
    <br>that the little child is possessed and is fighting the marriage.
    <br>That's why we were in that situation.
    <br>Then now I said, "Ok, fine. Let's go to church. Let's go to your church".
    <br>We went to her church and met the pastors.
    <br>They prayed and delivered the child.
    <br>We went back home.
    <br>The situation was not changing.
    <br>I got confused. This girl, at this age - she was just about four then, and depression had kicked in.
    <br>She was on depression medication.
    <br>I was like, "No. A child at this age cannot be on depression medication".
    <br>The child was by herself, my wife was by herself.
    <br>When I came home, I was confused, I didn't know what to do.
    <br>I love my wife, I love my daughter.
    <br>I found myself in the middle; I didn't know what to do.
    <br>I just said to myself, "She is praying every day. God will definitely answer her prayers
    <br>and she will get pregnant".
    <br>We lived like that; no happiness.
    <br>Three or four months down the line, my wife told me she was pregnant.
    <br>I was celebrating. I said, "This is the end of our problem".
    <br>No, this was not the end of our problem.
    <br>Now, she got pregnant.
    <br>I thought the distance would close.
    <br>The problem would get solved but the problem didn't get solved.
    <br>At that point now, it got worse.
    <br>I only heard this story she explained about her reason for not taking the child to school
    <br>whilst being at The SCOAN and we are living together
    <br>and this has been going on for more than a year.
    <br>So she stopped taking the child to school.
    <br>We are blessed; we have a lot of cars.
    <br>She drives; she is at home studying for her Master's degree programme in public health.
    <br>As she studies, she stays at home; she is not working.
    <br>So she normally takes the child to school; they go to church together.
    <br>Now, she stopped taking the child to school, stopped taking the child to church.
    <br>The nanny is the one - she gives the nanny taxi money to take the child.
    <br>The school is a five minutes drive from our home - five minutes.
    <br>On Sundays she goes to church; the nanny takes the child to church.
    <br>I looked at the situation and said, "Fine. She is a pregnant lady. Let me just leave it".
    <br>They say that when a lady is pregnant, her attitude, her behaviour, everything changes.
    <br>I left it at that point.
    <br>But it went on and on.
    <br>I got up one morning and said to her, "I don't know what is happening.
    <br>Where is that beautiful, loving, God-fearing lady I got married to?
    <br>How can you be so bitter? Even to take a child to school?
    <br>I don't care whether the child is possessed or not.
    <br>This is a child God has given me. That is my cross but I give her my life.
    <br>And I'm seeing you, you cannot just take this child to school.
    <br>If I'm dead, will you pay her school fees?" That is what I asked her.
    <br>No reaction came from my wife and honestly, that moment everything died within me.
    <br>I just decided, "Fine. I will just wait for her to give birth.
    <br>I will see how the situation will go".
    <br>She gave birth.
    <br>I was hoping now that she had given birth to a child.
    <br>Maybe she will understand how I feel towards this child,
    <br>now that she has a child of her own.
    <br>That was my thinking.
    <br>But it still didn't get any better.
    <br>It just didn't get any better.
    <br>The distance was just there; my wife wanted nothing to do with the child.
    <br>We were living together in a house - there is no happiness, love, togetherness.
    <br>I was confused; I didn't know what to do.
    <br>At that moment I just made a decision,
    <br>"My wife is studying; I cannot live with this situation anymore".
    <br>It has given me so much stress, my BP has gone so high,
    <br>I'm already on BP medication.
    <br>I even left my house one morning so confused and stressed,
    <br>drove my car into the street and an oncoming car hit me
    <br>Luckily it was a small taxi - I was driving a landcruiser -
    <br>it hit the car - it wasn't driving too fast; nobody was hurt.
    <br>I just apologised; my insurance took care of everything.
    <br>At that point, I started thinking that I can't live like this anymore.
    <br>I really didn't know what I had to do.
    <br>I made a promise to myself that I will make sure that my wife finishes her studies,
    <br>and make sure she gets a good job.
    <br>I started talking to my friends in her field,
    <br>"You are in public health, my wife is not in public health. Please, I want her--".
    <br>So we already started that process.
    <br>In my mind, I was thinking that when she gets a job, she will be settled,
    <br>find her an apartment, I put her there with the child,
    <br>we try to live apart, I see whether that works.
    <br>That was what I was thinking and I made up my mind, quietly within me.
    <br>We were just living with no love, no happiness, no affection, nothing.
    <br>Even in the midst of this challenge of your biological daughter being alleged as a witch,
    <br>and you were still trying to make preparations for your wife to get a job after her studies.
    <br>Yes, because that is our son.
    <br>If I'm not there tomorrow, I want to know that my wife is in a situation
    <br>where she can take care of our son.
    <br>That is what I was thinking to myself.
    <br>Now, with that mindset, I just decided to leave that situation at that point.
    <br>Three months ago, as the man of God rightly said--
    <br>My doctor is also a family friend. They have three daughters - friends of hers.
    <br>So when I went to my doctor that my medication was not working.
    <br>My BP was still high; I was having a lot of headache.
    <br>She should please do something about it.
    <br>She changed my medication.
    <br>Then she said to me, "But it is weekend. Why don't you send Emma over to spend time with the girls?"
    <br>I said, "It is fine. I will drop Emma over on Friday".
    <br>Going to pick Emma now, they called me on the side, "What is going on in your home, Helms?"
    <br>Who is Emma?
    <br>Emma is my daughter - this one.
    <br>I dropped her over at the doctor's house.
    <br>The husband is a medical doctor, the wife is a medical doctor,
    <br>the husband is a Cameroonian as well, living in Namibia.
    <br>We are in a Cameroonian community, we socialise in that way.
    <br>So I dropped Emma over.
    <br>Now going to get Emma, the husband asked me, "Helms, what is going on in your house?
    <br>As a medical doctor, I will speak. I don't really want to get involved in your family issue.
    <br>But this child is very depressed.
    <br>This child is very depressed and she is refusing to go back home.
    <br>Because I've been trying to take her back home, she is crying and refusing.
    <br>She doesn't want to go back home, that she is not happy".
    <br>Upon hearing this, I became very sad and angry.
    <br>I took Emma home, called my wife and told her,
    <br>"See, we have two kids.
    <br>We cannot have this girl and the little boy in the same house as parents,
    <br>and one is getting all the love, all the affection and all the attention
    <br>and the other is getting nothing.
    <br>So this situation already got me so stressed up.
    <br>I can't take it anymore.
    <br>This is August.
    <br>August, September, October - three months.
    <br>Within these three months, find a way to see how we can live in this house as a family".
    <br>That is what I told my wife. "If not, that's it!
    <br>We are going apart. I will find an apartment for you".
    <br>What I was planning to do after, I decided of doing it now
    <br>because I just couldn't take it anymore.
    <br>And this is in accordance with the three months the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, mentioned.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>Seriously, our journey of coming here has been too long.
    <br>It has been two years of pain, two years of frustration, two years of unhappiness.
    <br>Still it was a challenge coming to The SCOAN.
    <br>So when I said that now to my wife, a couple of days later she went to see her pastor.
    <br>Her pastor called me. I think she explained the situation, what I had told her, that we are going apart.
    <br>Her pastor called me and said, "Your wife told me this problem you guys are having at home
    <br>concerning this child".
    <br>I said to him, "Pastor, I'm in your church, my wife fellowships there.
    <br>We've been bringing this problem here for over a year.
    <br>If there is no solution, what do you want me to do?
    <br>If not, to just separate them apart because I cannot take it.
    <br>You are a pastor, pray and deliver her".
    <br>The pastor said to me, "No, it is not that I cannot pray and deliver this child.
    <br>It is that too many other pastors have spoken
    <br>and your wife is dead convinced that the child is possessed".
    <br>So he didn't want to say anything because it would be controversial.
    <br>So he then said to me that the coordinators in Namibia who coordinate for people to come to The SCOAN
    <br>were coming to his church in the next 30 minutes.
    <br>That is the only place he believed I could go to.
    <br>And the only man of God he believed that could speak peace and happiness
    <br>into my family, is Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You mean, this was a recommendation given by the pastor in Namibia?
    <br>This is what the senior pastor of my church told me.
    <br>He also came to The SCOAN; he was there last week.
    <br>He said, "I'm going to The SCOAN.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is my holy father.
    <br>So, I'm going to The SCOAN.
    <br>The people organising the trip are coming to my office.
    <br>So if you can afford it, please that is the only place I know
    <br>were you can go to and you will have peace at home.
    <br>Because once Prophet T.B. Joshua speaks, he will deliver your family.
    <br>So that is why I came here.
    <br>Once I walked into the church and was given a seat, I was just praying to myself,
    <br>"Lord, let the man of God locate us.
    <br>We cannot come here and go back because this is our last bus stop".
    <br>That was my prayer.
    <br>I was one of the first people he located.
    <br>So I'm here trusting that whilst we are here speaking, this problem is finished.
    <br>We go back a happy family.
    <br>I love my wife. I love my daughter. But I just don't know to which side to go.
    <br>I cannot take sides, I just cannot take sides.
    <br>Even coming here, the day before we started our journey,
    <br>a good family friend called me in the morning and asked, "Where are you, Helms?"
    <br>I said, "I'm on my way to work".
    <br>She asked whether I had gone far.
    <br>I said, "Yes, I left early because I have a very long day
    <br>because I'm travelling out of the country tomorrow".
    <br>She said, "Please come. I need to see you.
    <br>I have a message for you. I was praying and the Holy Spirit gave me a message for you".
    <br>I said, "Holy Spirit! Fine, I'm coming.
    <br>If I cannot make it during the day, I will come at the end of the day on my way home".
    <br>So I couldn't make it during the day.
    <br>At the end of the day, around 9pm on my way home, I stopped at her house.
    <br>She told me that she was praying and the Holy Spirit gave her a revelation
    <br>that we shouldn't go to The SCOAN, we shouldn't go to Nigeria.
    <br>We will not find a solution there. We should rather go to South Africa for prayers.
    <br>Ok. We all know that God is able to do all things.
    <br>In the midst of this confusion, you found your way to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty.
    <br>What do you now want to hear from the man of God?
    <br>I second what my wife said. I want the man of God to speak on this child and our marriage.
    <br>That is all I came here for and that is what I'm praying for.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Let's hear from our mother.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Katrine Chakoi. I'm a Cameroonian.
    <br>This is my son-in-law. His name is Mr Helms.
    <br>This is my daughter. Her name is Chakoi.
    <br>This is her son. His name is Helms Junior.
    <br>This is her step-daughter. Her name is Emma.
    <br>Ok, because of time. If we gave you time to explain, we would not be able to leave here today.
    <br>And the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, is eager to come into our midst.
    <br>But before then, I hope you are happy that your daughter and your son-in-law are here
    <br>to hear God's opinion about this marriage.
    <br>In fact, I'm very happy because when I went to Namibia,
    <br>I saw them living as strangers in the same house, like cats and dogs.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>To God be the glory. We believe that both of you have taken the right decision
    <br>to come to The SCOAN to hear God's opinion about this marriage
    <br>and the impression of your daughter all over Namibia, to be precise.
    <br>We believe God that at the moment the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, comes out into our midst,
    <br>let's believe God that definitely, we are going to hear God's opinion from him.
    <br>God bless you and thank You, Jesus, for this opportunity.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>After Mr and Mrs Helms Atud had share their emotional pain and offence that had shaken their marriage,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua came into their midst and spoke the mind of God
    <br>concerning their family and the little girl concerned.
    <br>Surely, the right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Let me talk to my mummy here. Come on!
    <br>I was listening to your testimony, your issue
    <br>concerning the disagreement, the fight between you and your wife and all other.
    <br>I learnt that the whole fight is about our little baby here.
    <br>That she is a witch, she is not a witch, isn't it?
    <br>That's true, Man of God.
    <br>I would like to hear from my sister, not you.
    <br>Let me hear from my sister. Feel free to talk. I just have one minute for you.
    <br>Yes. Actually, when I came to live with my husband,
    <br>I noticed some kind of abnormalities with the baby.
    <br>The baby would not like us to have prayers in the house.
    <br>She was rejecting a lot of things concerning Christianity.
    <br>Ok, simple. We learnt that a lot of prophets and men of God have given that message
    <br>that this lady is a witch.
    <br>That she is possessed.
    <br>Ok. What is your decision?
    <br>Do you see any sign that she is possessed?
    <br>Well, she doesn't like going to church, prayers in the house.
    <br>She just rejects all of these things.
    <br>Ok, it's alright. Thank you.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>A lot of prophets have convinced my wife that the child is possessed,
    <br>and that is why we are here.
    <br>Ok. Did your husband let you know that he has a baby at home before you married him?
    <br>Yes, he told me; I knew.
    <br>And you knew the baby before you married your husband?
    <br>Yes, I knew.
    <br>So, if I may just put it this way:
    <br>Since you chose to marry your husband and you knew this baby before you married your husband,
    <br>and your husband never hid this baby from you, he never?
    <br>Yes, he never did.
    <br>Ok. That is to show that whether the lady is a witch or not, and you know the baby,
    <br>and you were able to marry your husband with the witch,
    <br>why do you get to the house and you don't want that witch?
    <br>No, take it.
    <br>So can we say, when you married your husband,
    <br>that is when the witch possessed that lady?
    <br>You know, probably, at the time you later married your husband,
    <br>the witch possessed that girl.
    <br>Because you didn't see the lady as a witch before you married your husband.
    <br>Because I want to believe that if you knew that the lady was a witch,
    <br>you probably may not have married this man. Can you answer the question?
    <br>I came and met her in my husband's house.
    <br>But you told me that when you were outside and about to marry this man,
    <br>he told you that he has a baby.
    <br>Yes, he told me that he had a baby. So I came and I was staying with the baby.
    <br>It was during the time that I was staying with the baby---
    <br>Take it easy.
    <br>The question - you knew this baby, this little girl before you married your husband,
    <br>before you finally came to the house?
    <br>Yes, I did.
    <br>Ok. Did you see her as a witch?
    <br>No.
    <br>Ok, it was when you married the man, the girl became a witch.
    <br>Yes, when I later noticed it.
    <br>No, wait. It was when you came to the house, you later realised that the girl is a witch.
    <br>Yes, I later--
    <br>Wait.
    <br>What I'm saying:
    <br>Before you came to the house, the lady was not a witch.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. It was when you came to the house and became a wife,
    <br>you later realised that the baby--
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Aha. Ok.
    <br>So this means this child was not a witch before you married her dad.
    <br>No.
    <br>Ok. So it means it must be you and your husband that possessed this girl
    <br>because it must be you and your husband that possessed this girl.
    <br>So if this girl is a witch, it means you are the biggest witch and your husband is the biggest wizard.
    <br>So it is a shameful thing to tell the world that she is a witch
    <br>when you never saw this girl as a witch before you married the father.
    <br>And it was when you got to the house that you realised she is a witch.
    <br>It means it is either you or your husband that possessed this girl.
    <br>My sister, I just want you to learn this wisdom.
    <br>This girl is not a witch at all.
    <br>And two:
    <br>I want to salute you.
    <br>Because if you didn't love this man, if you wanted to leave, you wouldn't need to come here.
    <br>It means the love is there.
    <br>There are some people out there that are deceiving.
    <br>They deceived your spirit
    <br>because you regard them as men of God or women of God.
    <br>Never to blame you at all; you have no blame.
    <br>So I want to say, you are a good woman.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because for you to come here and for you to be open,
    <br>and you really want to know who this girl is,
    <br>I want to salute you. Thank you very much.
    <br>So she has no blame at all because she is very thorough.
    <br>They say, find out the truth and the truth will set you free.
    <br>She tried to find out the truth.
    <br>If she were wicked, she would have harmed this girl.
    <br>But she never harmed her.
    <br>You know the way and manner people behave to witches and wizards
    <br>when they know a baby is a witch. They can even kill the girl.
    <br>They can even poison the girl. They can even do any evil to that girl.
    <br>But she is not interested in that.
    <br>She just wants to ask from God.
    <br>She never said she is the one who killed her witch.
    <br>She said some people say she is a witch. It is not her fault.
    <br>And I want to thank you too for also persevering, trying to know the truth.
    <br>This woman loves you.
    <br>If you leave this woman, you will leave your destined wife.
    <br>I know she loves me; I know.
    <br>But this issue has caused a lot of distance between us, Man of God.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>Do you know that what happened now will strengthen your marriage.
    <br>Definitely, Man of God.
    <br>And it will make your marriage mature.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God. Thank you very much.
    <br>So you will see that this woman is a mother and you are a father.
    <br>So you people have passed a test in marriage
    <br>Thank you, Man of God. Amen.
    <br>Can you give a hug to your husband? Thank you.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank you very much. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you. I will see you.
    <br>So, madam, you will be my guest. After the service I want to see you.
    <br>Thank you.
