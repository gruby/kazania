    <br>Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus from Ondo, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem which I had, had been with me for five years.
    <br>As the Mass Prayer was going on, I felt that something wanted to come out of my mouth.
    <br>Then, I vomited it and my body felt free; help me to thank God.
    <br>Strange Meatlike Object
    <br>Vomited During The Mass Prayer
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>That is what I vomited out.
    <br>It looks like meat; it is not easy to describe.
    <br>I am very surprised that such a thing can come out of me; I have never seen such a thing in my life.
    <br>We have just listened to Mr Titus Oluwarotimi.
    <br>He said he is from Ondo State.
    <br>He came with a problem of moving object that had been tormenting him for the past five years.
    <br>And he said when the mass prayer was going on, the Spirit of God touched him
    <br>and he felt like vomiting.
    <br>He was struggling; something wanted to come out of his system.
    <br>When that thing came out, he vomited this object we are seeing right in front of him.
    <br>You can see how the object looks like. We can't really give a description of what it is.
    <br>He said this is what had been tormenting him for so long.
    <br>After vomiting this object we are seeing, he can now press his stomach without pain,
    <br>he can breathe without pain. All that pain is gone now and he is completely free
    <br>from this problem that had been moving in his body and tormenting him for the past five years.
    <br>He said he vomited this out of his stomach because the thing continued to move
    <br>all around his stomach - from one part to another. But today, he has been set free.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>That was how it all happened.
    <br>The man who was set free during the mass prayer is going to speak in one of the Nigerian languages
    <br>and we are going to interpret for us in English.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus
    <br>Ondo, Nigeria
    <br>The man said his name is Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus, and he is from Ondo State (Nigeria).
    <br>I thank God that I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was moving objects all over m body
    <br>and I had this problem for five years.
    <br>I went to many witch doctors and medical practitioners but there was no solution.
    <br>He said he came to The SCOAN with the problem of severe moving object for five years.
    <br>He went to several places in search of solution to this problem of severe moving object
    <br>We want to ask him more, how God Almighty set him free from this problem.
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus
    <br>Mass Prayer Testimony
    <br>The object was moving all over my body and as a result, I was not okay.
    <br>I emitted a bad smell anytime I belched.
    <br>It was as if I was in a cage and I felt so uneasy.
    <br>I then decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man further explained that this problem had been tormenting him for the past five years.
    <br>The problem of severe moving object gave him discomfort all over his body
    <br>because the object kept on moving from one part of his body to another.
    <br>Because of this problem, he developed a body odour; he smelt like a rotten meat.
    <br>This had been the problem he had been nursing, moving from one place to another
    <br>but there was no solution before he came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus
    <br>Mass Prayer Testimony
    <br>I thank God Almighty. When they were conducting the Mass Prayer that Sunday,
    <br>it was as if hot water was poured on me.
    <br>Suddenly, I vomited and my body became light.
    <br>I was surprised that that substance actually came out of my body.
    <br>My body became light.
    <br>Since that Sunday, everything has been going fine for me.
    <br>The man further explained that God Almighty set him free when he came to The SCOAN.
    <br>During the Mass Prayer, when the evangelists were praying,
    <br>he felt like a hot water was poured on him and his body started shaking and shivering.
    <br>He felt like vomiting, something wanted to come out of him.
    <br>He intended to run out but he was asked to go back inside the church.
    <br>As he was there shivering, he wanted to vomit, something wanted to come out of him forcefully.
    <br>When that thing came out, it was that substance like a raw meat
    <br>that we saw on the floor a moment ago and it is on the screen right now.
    <br>This is what he vomited out.
    <br>He said, since he vomited this raw meat substance, all the pain, discomfort,
    <br>the excessive sweating and body odour are gone.
    <br>That he is completely free now, and he is here to thank God Almighty for what God has done for him.
    <br>So, we want to ask him more questions regarding this problem.
    <br>We want him to tell us how he came about this very problem in his life.
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus
    <br>Mass Prayer Testimony
    <br>I had this problem when I went to a witch doctor who gave me charms to eat
    <br>because I was in need of a career breakthrough as a technician and driver.
    <br>I first worked as a technician and during this time, I went to a witch doctor
    <br>and my life was totally destroyed.
    <br>Then, I became a driver and at a point, I owned eight buses and a car.
    <br>After visiting a witch doctor, I sold all my vehicles
    <br>and I could not give account of the money realised from the sales.
    <br>I wondered what could be happening to me so, I decided that I must come to The SCOAN.
    <br>That was how I came last week Sunday.
    <br>I went to the witch doctor because I wanted a breakthrough in my career.
    <br>When I visited the witch doctor, my problems became worse.
    <br>I started blaming myself.
    <br>The witch doctor prepared a charm with snail and meat for me to eat.
    <br>Since I was given the charm to eat,
    <br>I started experiencing moving objects all over my body and things became bad for me.
    <br>We further asked the man what the cause was for this problem of severe moving object in his life.
    <br>He said, the problem started when he visited a witch doctor.
    <br>He visited a witch doctor and asked the witch doctor to do a charm for him
    <br>so that he could progress in all his endeavours.
    <br>He said the witch doctor did a lot of concoctions and cooked a lot of things
    <br>like snails and other forms of animals and put everything together
    <br>and asked him to eat. After he ate that, he later found out
    <br>that something started moving all around his body, giving him discomfort.
    <br>Not only was he afflicted at that point in time,
    <br>he said the things he had before he went to the witch doctor -
    <br>he had eight buses and one car - they were all gone.
    <br>They were all completely destroyed. He lost everything and became poor after he visited the witch doctor.
    <br>This problem of moving object also started, giving him discomfort.
    <br>He had to move from one place to another and this is how he had been suffering for five years
    <br>before he visited The SCOAN.
    <br>Last week Sunday he vomited out a raw meat substance
    <br>and ever since then, he has been completely free.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the miracle-working Jesus!
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus
    <br>Mass Prayer Testimony
    <br>My body is light and totally different from the way it was since last Sunday.
    <br>I do see the man of God in my dream now.
    <br>Around 12am today, I saw the man of God in my dream.
    <br>He then gave me the keys of a brand new vehicle and house.
    <br>He told me that I should fear not, that my security is guaranteed. This gave me confidence.
    <br>We give glory to God. The man further explained that he is giving thanks to God Almighty.
    <br>That ever since he vomited that raw meat substance, he has been very free
    <br>and he has also been having dreams of the man of God, coming to pray for him in his dreams.
    <br>That even last night, he saw the man of God coming to him in his dream,
    <br>handing over to him his breakthrough keys
    <br>and telling him that he should not be afraid, that God will continue to be with him and secure him.
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus
    <br>Mass Prayer Testimony
    <br>My advice to everyone is to move close to God.
    <br>We asked him what his word of advice is for everyone listening
    <br>and the man said that he wants everyone to trust in God Almighty.
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus
    <br>Mass Prayer Testimony
    <br>We encouraging him that now, that the Lord God Almighty in His infinite mercy
    <br>has set him free - not only setting him free, healing him and delivering him from that problem -
    <br>that he should make the Word of God the standard for his life, keep the Word in his heart
    <br>and see to it that he does what the Word says and we pray that God Almighty will grant him
    <br>the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together for the miracle-working Jesus!
    <br>We want to listen to more testimonies from the man that vomited a raw meat substance
    <br>during the Mass Prayer offered by the evangelists sent by the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Join us as we listen to him. He is going to speak in one of the Nigerian languages,
    <br>and we are going to interpret for us in English.
    <br>Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus.
    <br>I was the person that vomited a meat-like substance during the Mass Prayer.
    <br>Since I vomited that meat-like substance, I am healed.
    <br>All the things I used to experience before are gone.
    <br>I no longer experience the body pains and hotness. I thank God.
    <br>We have listened to the man. He said his name is Mr Oluwarotimi Olajide Festus from Ondo State.
    <br>He is the very man that vomited a raw-meat substance
    <br>during the course of the Mass Prayer offered by the evangelists.
    <br>He said, before he vomited that raw-meat substance,
    <br>he was having severe stomach pain and hotness of the body -
    <br>that is, internal heat and a lot of discomfort.
    <br>After he vomited that raw-meat substance, all the pains are gone; he is no longer having the pain.
    <br>He can press his stomach now without pain, and he is not feeling any discomfort.
    <br>He is very happy that God Almighty has set him free from all forms of pain
    <br>that came as a result of that raw-meat substance that was in his system, that he vomited out.
    <br>He is so thankful to God Almighty for setting him free.
