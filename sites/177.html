  </h3>

    Hallelujah!
    <br>Don't Lose Focus | Powerful Sermon With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Sometimes discouraged
    <br>But not defeated
    <br>Cast down
    <br>But not destroyed
    <br>There are times I don't understand
    <br>But I believe
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>I've had struggles
    <br>And disappointments
    <br>There are times I felt so alone
    <br>Some of my friends they let me down
    <br>But I still believe
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>Around for me
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>Around for me
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>I can see the breaking of day
    <br>God is making a way
    <br>A change is coming for me
    <br>If I stand strong and believe
    <br>There is no reason to doubt
    <br>I know He's working it out
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>And it won't always be like this
    <br>He will perfect that concern in me
    <br>And sooner or later
    <br>It will turn in my favour
    <br>Sooner or later
    <br>Turn in my favour
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>It won't always be like this
    <br>The Lord will perfect that concern in me
    <br>And sooner or later
    <br>It will turn in my favour
    <br>Sooner or later
    <br>Turn in my favour
    <br>Sooner or later
    <br>Turn in my favour
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>Lift your hands and continue to worship because that situation is turning around for your good.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Around for me
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>Around for me
    <br>It's turning around for me

    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>Put those hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah Jesus!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God be with us?
    <br>[Who can be against us.]
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers at home, wherever you are, Jesus is there.
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>[Nowhere.]
    <br>Jesus is there!
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>Every message and testimony you have received and heard today point to salvation.
    <br>What else again?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am saved; Jesus is my Saviour."
    <br>Every testimony, message you have heard point to deliverance.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am delivered; Jesus is my Deliverer."
    <br>Every testimony, message you received point to healing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am healed; Jesus is my Healer."
    <br>What else?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I'm here to talk about maintenance;
    <br>how you can maintain healing, deliverance, salvation you have received.
    <br>Maintenance is of much importance.
    <br>Anybody can buy a car, but not everyone can maintain car.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>For the past few weeks I've been talking about certain areas of gospel
    <br>because I realised that some of our colleagues and parts of the world...
    <br>Everyday you open your newspaper or internet, you learn that ministers of God commit suicide.
    <br>Christians commit suicide; why should anyone commit suicide?
    <br>Why should a pastor commit suicide; carry a gun and shoot himself...?
    <br>We have heard so much.
    <br>Why should anyone commit suicide?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If you are a Christian, what can cause depression?
    <br>Why should anyone be depressed?
    <br>And you are a believer, a follower of Jesus - why?
    <br>Let's, first of all look at John 16:33.
    <br>"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace.
    <br>In the world you will have tribulation..."
    <br>Remember, you are in the world, but you are not a part of them,
    <br>because you are in Christ but you live in the world.
    <br>"In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer,
    <br>I have overcome the world."
    <br>For those who have the key to the language,
    <br>they will know this message is "pregnant".
    <br>If you can try to know the meaning - it is not just the way we read it.
    <br>Let's read again and take note of those key words.
    <br>"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace."
    <br>The Word does not say, "You will" or "You will have";
    <br>it says, "In Me you may have peace" - take note of that.
    <br>You will have tribulation; you know the meaning of tribulation:
    <br>every foolish thing is called tribulation, those things you don't want, you complain about,
    <br>that cause you tension and pressure.
    <br>Think of those things that cause you pressure and tension.
    <br>It says, "In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer,
    <br>I have overcome the world."
    <br>It means that what we are looking for, asking for are past tense,
    <br>are things that have been achieved.
    <br>The healing you were asking for, is past tense issue.
    <br>Let's look at 1 Corinthians 10:13.
    <br>I want you to put these two messages side by side; John 16:33, and now this one.
    <br>1 Corinthians 10:13:
    <br>"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man".
    <br>What is common to man?
    <br>It says no temptation has overtaken you - and who is talking here?
    <br>"... except such as is common to man;
    <br>but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond..."
    <br>You know you face temptation all the time.
    <br>God will not allow you to be tempted beyond...!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't lose your focus".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Don't lose your focus.]
    <br>What are the things that can make one lose focus?
    <br>Let us think about it.
    <br>What are the things that can make one lose focus?
    <br>Those are the foolish things.
    <br>Foolish things that cause tension and pressure.
    <br>No matter what was going on in Jesus' life, He kept His focus.
    <br>You are a Christian, you have read your Bible, New Testament,
    <br>you knew what happened to Jesus when satan took Him to the hill and when He was hungry -
    <br>think about that, and the garden of Gethsemane; He said, "I was sent not to do my will but Father's".
    <br>No matter what was going on in Jesus' life, He kept His focus.
    <br>Whether people were praising Him with palm fronds, "Hallelujah! Hosanna!",
    <br>His focus remained the same.
    <br>Sometimes, when I see people running...
    <br>When you do not know where you are going - your destination,
    <br>what the future holds for you - you are bound to panic when crisis comes.
    <br>Crisis will come but the Bible says, 'Be of good cheer, I have overcome'.
    <br>When you don't know where you are going
    <br>and you don't know your destination, when temptation comes,
    <br>you begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>When you know where you are going, whatever happens to you midway...
    <br>You know what I mean by 'midway'?
    <br>It means before you get to your promised land.
    <br>M I D W A Y
    <br>Midway - before you get to where you are going, the destination, the throne.
    <br>When you know where you are going, whatever happens to you -
    <br>it can be cancer, temptation, tribulation, whatever, just mention what Bible says...
    <br>When you know where you are going, whatever happens to you midway,
    <br>cannot change your focus.
    <br>God is not a man that lies.
    <br>If revelation has come to you that you will get to that gate, you will definitely get there.
    <br>But if you believe you must march on a red carpet on a way to that gate - you are wrong.
    <br>If revelation comes that that gate is your crown, throne, promised land,
    <br>and you believe that you must walk on the red carpet there,
    <br>you would not encounter tribulation, sickness, affliction, temptation of any kind,
    <br>and you would just get to the gate -
    <br>you just want to walk on the platform of...
    <br>Yes, they say you would get to the gate,
    <br>but remember - it says, "I have given you power to trample" on what?
    <br>Even when you drink deadly poison, that power - I have given you.
    <br>It means you will march on the snake, scorpion, there will be crisis, temptation, but "I have given you"...
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you will not encounter challenges.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There will be challenges and tribulations. Run to God, don't run from Him."
    <br>Instead of worrying about things around you, the situation you have,
    <br>the challenges, just name it - run to God.
    <br>He has promised He will not allow your challenges
    <br>or situation beyond what you are able.
    <br>How will you know that promotion is coming?
    <br>Challenges are informants.
    <br>Temptations are informants.
    <br>If greater something is coming, the other people attack.
    <br>As a Christian you know, "Something is about to happen".
    <br>The greater the attack, the bigger the promise that is coming.
    <br>You can't just walk to the promise or crown.
    <br>That attack will be sickness, limitation, disappointment, temptation.
    <br>If you are a Christian, remember God is faithful.
    <br>If you are with and for Him in truth and faith,
    <br>He will never allow your challenges,
    <br>situation or temptation beyond what you are able.
    <br>When a nation is facing a crisis, the nation should know that the future of that nation is what satan has seen.
    <br>No nation will walk on the carpet to the greater future without greater challenges.
    <br>Every big, advanced, powerful country or nation crossed an attack, great challenges, before they got there.
    <br>The situation you are facing - you are stagnant...
    <br>You know what I mean by 'stagnant' -
    <br>you are not moving forward, you are not moving back
    <br>because you dodge challenges; our God is not God that dodges challenges.
    <br>I am here today because my focus has not changed
    <br>in the midst of all these challenges and situations.
    <br>You also can be there, the centre of your own world,
    <br>if your focus does not change in the midst of challenges and situations.
    <br>I know where I am going.
    <br>I will get there if I continue to trust Him more in the midst of challenges.
    <br>We abandon our posts when challenges come.
    <br>We worship less when trouble comes.
    <br>You begin to complain, "Why me of all this?"
    <br>You begin to compare yourself to others,
    <br>"This man is a Christian but he still drinks and does all that,
    <br>but me - I have been worshipping God in truth and faith; why all this attack?"
    <br>A Christian who measures his Christian life by his situation
    <br>will never get to his destination.
    <br>If you continue to measure your Christian life by your situation,
    <br>you will not get to your destination.
    <br>You measure your faith by your situation.
    <br>When a situation comes, you allow you situation to mislead you all the time;
    <br>you allow your situation to affect your relationship with God,
    <br>whereas it is meant to prepare you and strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What is your situation?"
    <br>That your are a Christian does not mean you will not be sick.
    <br>When situation, challenges come, don't run from God, run to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When situation, challenges come, don't run from God, run to God."
    <br>Draw me close to You
    <br>Never let me go
    <br>I lay it all down again
    <br>To hear You say that I'm Your friend
    <br>You are my desire
    <br>No one else will do
    <br>Cause nothing else
    <br>Could take Your place
    <br>To feel the warmth
    <br>Of Your embrace
    <br>Help me find a way
    <br>Bring me back to You
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>You're all I've ever needed
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>Help me know You are near
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>You're all I've ever needed
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>Help me know You are near
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>You're all I've ever needed
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>Help me know You are near
    <br>Hallelujah! 
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Instead of worrying about things around you,
    <br>worrying about your situation that creates stress and tension, run to God.
    <br>This world is world of distraction.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This world is world of distraction."
    <br>It can cause distraction by sickness, limitation in progress, joblessness; those things cause distraction.
    <br>You want to go this way, you are running this way; you want to run a straight race -
    <br>that is what God wants us to run.
    <br>But when sickness comes, when headache comes...
    <br>You know you cannot run with headache.
    <br>Even if you want to run with headache, you will slow down.
    <br>That is distraction.
    <br>What caused distraction?
    <br>Headache.
    <br>You started running - you received a phone call that something nasty happened.
    <br>What caused distraction?
    <br>Bad news.
    <br>This world is world of distraction
    <br>and 24/7 information stream gets one off track.
    <br>Your situation causes you distraction.
    <br>Instead of worrying about things, your situation, run to God
    <br>because you will continue to have that as long as you live.
    <br>No examination, no promotion.
    <br>No test, no promotion.
    <br>Your test could be sickness, temptation, tribulation, setback.
    <br>What is your own test?
    <br>Jesus was tested after fasting forty days and nights
    <br>when He came back from the mountain.
    <br>No one was expecting such great anointing in Him,
    <br>and satan still had that guts to carry Him to...
    <br>It was not when He was going to wilderness,
    <br>it was when He finished fasting for forty days and nights;
    <br>He was loaded and fired; satan still had guts to talk.
    <br>He knew challenges at that point; Jesus was hungry.
    <br>Satan will not come to you without looking at the challenges you have.
    <br>It is sickness you have; he will come through that sickness and begin to talk to you,
    <br>"You know you will die. Look at Mr - the sickness you have killed him."
    <br>He will even want to send a doctor that will give that information for you.
    <br>You meet the doctor and he says, "Go and do your will.
    <br>These are the files of people who died of this sickness you have; 1,2,3,4...
    <br>Their sickness was not so bad as yours. I don't know how you can escape it."
    <br>You say, "Doctor, what are you saying?"
    <br>That is the voice of satan.
    <br>He will come through your weakness.
    <br>He came to Jesus and said to Him, "If you are the Son of God... Look, I will give you all.
    <br>You don't need to do all this."
    <br>Our Saviour was not desperate, He was hungry
    <br>but He was not desperate for food.
    <br>You are always desperate for solution.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Saviour was hungry but He was not desperate for food".
    <br>But you are always desperate and when you are desperate for solution,
    <br>and you are desperate for anything, you can be tempted.
    <br>Don't Lose Focus | Powerful Sermon With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Desperation is the challenge you are having.
    <br>You don't wait or ask for God's time.
    <br>What is the meaning of desperation?
    <br>Desperation means a man who will never say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>but always asks, "Give me, give me!"
    <br>If it is time to pray, you will say, "God, I am having pain. Heal me!"
    <br>But you have forgotten the healing you had in the past.
    <br>It is like you wake up in the morning and enter your father's room and say,
    <br>"Daddy, I need money, I need to go there."
    <br>Next day again, "Daddy I have a headache."
    <br>Your daddy will say, "You never say 'Good morning'. You keep asking 'Give me...'
    <br>There is no 'Good morning' in your dictionary."
    <br>In the same vein, ask yourself how many times do you start by saying "Thank You, Jesus"
    <br>before you ask?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How many times do you start by saying "Thank You, Jesus
    <br>for what You have been doing in my life; thank You, Jesus for keeping me alive;
    <br>thank You, Jesus" before at the end, you ask for whatever you want to ask?"
    <br>Desperation will not allow you to say, "Thank You, Jesus" before asking.
