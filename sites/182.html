  <p>    
    <br>Let us listen to what this man has to say.
    <br>My name is Mustapha Umar.
    <br>I am from Adamawa State, Yola.
    <br>I am a Boko Haram member.
    <br>Boko Haram is a cult.
    <br>I know why I joined the cult.
    <br>We have killed many souls from Adamawa to Maiduguri (Borno) States.
    <br>What brought you here?
    <br>This is my first time to come to Lagos.
    <br>And you came to where?
    <br>We came to The SCOAN.
    <br>We stopped at the junction there.
    <br>- Junction opposite the church?
    <br>- It was opposite the church.
    <br>When you stopped there - what for?
    <br>We stopped there.
    <br>We used a 'maruwa' (three-wheeler) to come to The SCOAN and dropped at the junction.
    <br>Opposite the junction, a Hausa man sells some things.
    <br>What is he selling?
    <br>He sells sweets, soap, cigarettes and provisions.
    <br>When you met the man - what else?
    <br>So, when we met the man, we were five in number.
    <br>I was holding the bag which had the instruments we came with.
    <br>I met the man and asked him to keep the bag.
    <br>You met the man, and you asked him to keep the bag.
    <br>The bag contained what?
    <br>It contained some instruments.
    <br>What is the 'instrument'?
    <br>All those instruments were to destroy and kill - a bomb.
    <br>I gave him the bag and said, "Keep this bag for me."
    <br>He said, "No", that he doesn't keep anything for anybody there.
    <br>I spoke Hausa language to him because I saw him as my only brother here.
    <br>He refused to collect the bag.
    <br>We decided to carry the bag with us.
    <br>I said, "Let us sit down here and eat."
    <br>After we had eaten, we would prepare for our mission here.
    <br>We sat down and ate as they brought food for us.
    <br>The woman had a television in her shop and we were watching it.
    <br>You were watching what?
    <br>We were watching the woman's television.
    <br>What was the station?
    <br>It was Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw you particularly, you were preaching to people at that time.
    <br>As you were preaching, we were sitting down, eating.
    <br>By the time you prayed and stretched your hand toward the screen,
    <br>it was like you were dealing with us - as if you laid your hand on our faces.
    <br>SHOCKING Confession Of BOKO HARAM Member!!!
    <br>While the bag that contained the bomb and your group were there eating,
    <br>you saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>As we watched Emmanuel TV, you were preaching to people -
    <br>you had not yet stretched your hand.
    <br>At that time, we were just eating.
    <br>Once you stretched your hand, it was like you laid it on our faces directly.
    <br>That was when confusion came among us.
    <br>Assuming you people were not there when the prayer was going on;
    <br>what was the plan?
    <br>Our plan was to take souls at The SCOAN.
    <br>That bomb inside the bag - how would you do the harm?
    <br>It is just like a meter; there are wires you join together.
    <br>The button we press can be set to explode in one hour or one minute.
    <br>We can set it to explode in three minutes.
    <br>If we set it to five minutes and drop it,
    <br>before five minutes is over, we would leave that place.
    <br>- You people would leave the place?
    <br>- We would leave the place.
    <br>What would happen?
    <br>All the souls around there - everybody will go.
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>Why are you here?
    <br>Why I am here? Since that day, I wanted to go back home but couldn't.
    <br>Anytime I lie down, I would see you.
    <br>It is disturbing me too much.
    <br>What is disturbing you?
    <br>You are disturbing me.
    <br>I don't know what I did to you.
    <br>Where are your colleagues - the other people?
    <br>Everybody scattered.
    <br>Why are you alone?
    <br>Why me alone? I don't know why I stand alone.
    <br>It is bothering me too much.
    <br>This is my first time to come to Lagos.
    <br>So other people are still in Lagos?
    <br>I don't know where they are now.
    <br>I called them on phone but none of them picked my call.
    <br>What of the bag with the bomb?
    <br>Our master took it back.
    <br>OK, how do you come about these things?
    <br>What gives you the courage to do this?
    <br>How do you manage to have the heart to do what you are doing?
    <br>They wrote something in a language.
    <br>Then, they washed it and gave it to me to drink.
    <br>- You drank it?
    <br>- I drank it.
    <br>That was the day I was initiated.
    <br>After drinking it, I had the mind to kill souls.
    <br>OK, why did you want to see me?
    <br>Why can't you run away?
    <br>Everybody ran away, but you;
    <br>why are you coming here to say this kind of thing?
    <br>Why? What is worrying you? Tell us.
    <br>You are the particular person who is disturbing me.
    <br>You told me I shouldn't join that group again.
    <br>You said the group, Boko Haram will no longer exist.
    <br>I asked why you came to see me.
    <br>Why am I coming to this place?
    <br>I want to go but I don't have the spirit to go back any longer.
    <br>- You don't have the spirit to do it again?
    <br>- I don't have the spirit to do it again.
    <br>This is why I don't want to sleep in the night - I would always see you laying that hand.
    <br>- You don't sleep in the night?
    <br>- I don't want to sleep.
    <br>If I sleep, you would be disturbing me, praying for me and laying hands on me.
    <br>Since he could not sleep, and rest, and has no peace,
    <br>he says he wants to die, if I don't release him.
    <br>I don't know why he should say that.
    <br>Other people have ran away, and I know anywhere they are, they are under bondage.
    <br>SHOCKING Confession Of BOKO HARAM Member!!!
    <br>They are under bondage, serious torture, which this man could not bear.
    <br>He said he would not run away, he wants to get free.
    <br>I want to tell you that for the past two weeks now I have been wearing these jeans.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>This is two weeks now.
    <br>I wore them last week, I wore them yesterday, the same jeans I am wearing now.
    <br>You should know that something is going on.
    <br>I have been in a serious battle for the past two weeks.
    <br>SHOCKING Confession Of BOKO HARAM Member!!!
    <br>Those who looked at me yesterday know that this is what I wore.
    <br>Last week - this is what I wore too - the same.
    <br>I would have worn the same shirt as yesterday, but people would easily see that it was the same one.
    <br>It is not possible for me to stand in your midst and begin to tell you what I have seen in the spirit
    <br>about what was to happen.
    <br>I have seen it for the past three weeks.
    <br>I have also set a trap on the corners of the church.
    <br>SHOCKING Confession Of BOKO HARAM Member!!!
    <br>Anywhere the trap was, it was to catch.
    <br>We didn't even want them to enter here, because their entering here would create fear.
    <br>Just a discussion concerning the issue - the trap for the past three weeks.
    <br>I will not stand here to tell you...
    <br>I can be telling you the prophecies about any another nation, but concerning me...
    <br>What would you do for me now?
    <br>You have been praying for me already.
    <br>If I stand up now and say, "This is what is going to happen",
    <br>I don't know the way you would look at it.
    <br>So, I keep it to myself.
    <br>Jesus gives the strength.
    <br>Here is the brother.
    <br>I want him to be released.
    <br>He could not help himself, he does not know the direction to follow.
    <br>He cannot close his eyes, sit down, do anything.
    <br>Our mission is to separate him from this spirit that is controlling him to do that.
    <br>We are not to fight mere flesh and blood.
    <br>We are to be armed for battle.
    <br>Brother, you say the problem you are facing: you cannot sleep or close your eyes?
    <br>I cannot sleep or close my eyes.
    <br>Even now, I am having a headache because I don't sleep in the night.
    <br>Anytime I lie down and sleep, I would see you,
    <br>hitting me on my chest, disturbing me; I wouldn't know what I did.
    <br>When I wake up, I would want to ask you why you are disturbing me
    <br>but then, I would no longer see you.
    <br>The thought of evil against the anointed man of God is a crime
    <br>and it is an abomination to God, if you are a true man of God.
    <br>That thought just sitting down somewhere, anywhere you are;
    <br>you are thinking, "What can we do? How do we get him? "How do we destroy him?
    <br>How do we fool him? How do we disgrace him?"
    <br>It is God you are talking about.
    <br>"Touch not My Anointed and do him no harm."
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>- Who am I?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Can you face me?
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>On the floor!
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>Whatever they might have given you that inspired you to kill people - vomit it out.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>On the floor!
    <br>He is looking at the person who is talking.
    <br>On the floor!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Imagine they carry that bomb into this place.
    <br>OK. Stand up!
    <br>Run!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Have you attempted any operation before and failed?
    <br>I have never failed before.
    <br>There was the operation we did at the Air-force Base at Maiduguri.
    <br>- You were one of them?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>We went to Adamawa State, Michika, two weeks ago.
    <br>And you never attempted anything and failed before?
    <br>We never failed.
    <br>How is it you failed in this operation?
    <br>The reason this one failed when we came to The SCOAN was because
    <br>we went to eat but before, when we went for any job like this one,
    <br>we would never think of going to eat
    <br>because we would have already satisfied ourselves before coming out.
    <br>We didn't know what pushed us to decide to go into the shop to eat.
    <br>While we were sitting down eating, we were five people,
    <br>we looked at the television when you laid your hand on the screen;
    <br>you laid it on our faces and that was when the confusion started
    <br>and everybody found their way.

    <br>Place your hand on you chest.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name

    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The spirit that was leading him to kill is gone.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>Man of God, thank you!
    <br>- Speak louder!
    <br>- I say thank you.
    <br>He is crying.
    <br>He says thank you; he feels different.
    <br>He is now the very person he used to know.
    <br>He cannot slap people now, talk less of killing people.
    <br>So he has been delivered.
    <br>He has a lot to say because a lot has gone on.
    <br>He is going to defecate everything that he has eaten because everything is neutralized now.
    <br>There were beads (charm) you used to wear.
    <br>Yes, I used to wear it but it was very tight.
    <br>How do you know that I was wearing something - beads?
    <br>He says what?
    <br>He asked how the man of God knew that he used to wear something on his waist.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>I am very sorry.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you want me to ask a lot of questions.
    <br>He has said it all; this is the first operation he failed.
    <br>Whatever you want to hear; that is not my nature.
    <br>My nature: I love people, I can't fight mere blood and flesh but the spirit being that caused this.
    <br>My duty is to deliver him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>If you are thinking of repercussion;
    <br>what would have happened if 200 people would just die, and the name of the ministry -
    <br>if you are thinking about that, you should also think about Christ on the cross for you.
