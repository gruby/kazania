  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>I break every hindrance that will not allow you to receive your blessing today,
    <br>be broken!
    <br>That doubt, be broken!
    <br>That immorality, be broken!
    <br>That doubt, be broken!
    <br>That immorality, be broken!
    <br>That unfaithfulness, be broken!
    <br>Faith in yourself, be broken!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Because you are destined to be delivered, be delivered!
    <br>You are destined to be free, be free!
    <br>You are destined to be blessed, be blessed!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rejoice.
    <br>PRAYER FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH DOUBT!
    <br>T.B. Joshua
