    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Nayeli Santiago
    <br>Mexico City, Mexico
    <br>I am an actuary and I own a College of Science and I also have an internet TV show.
    <br>Testimony From Mexico Crusade Mass Prayer
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I knew about the crusade through a friend who wanted me to accompany her.
    <br>At first, I thought , 'Okay, I will go with her. If God wants me to be there I will be there'
    <br>but it was not something that really excited me.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>At first, I thought that if God wanted me to be there, I would be there because I had no ticket.
    <br>Fortunately, people were giving the tickets out for free outside.
    <br>I went inside and then, the prophet came and gave a beautiful message about love.
    <br>When deliverance started, I thought it was fake and I didn't believe.
    <br>I thought it was all a show because I had never seen a person with multiple sclerosis stand up.

    <br>The second day, my friend called me again
    <br>and told me that God wanted me to be there.
    <br>I accompanied my friend again but I went there with a judgemental attitude
    <br>I had told the Lord that if He really wanted me to be there, I would be there.
    <br>Once again, the praise and worship started and once again, I was judgemental.
    <br>The prophet preached and then, he came down to start the deliverance.
    <br>The music was really loud and I was praying for my family.
    <br>At that moment, I felt a hot sensation in my knees but I still didn't believe.
    <br>I went to the bathroom to check my knees  and they were really hot.
    <br>I noticed that I could bend my knees.
    <br>For a long time when I walked, I would hear a noise in my knees.
    <br>My knees would hurt when I was walking. It would feel as if I had no cartilage in my knees.
    <br>I couldn't believe it until the Holy Spirit filled me with joy.
    <br>That was when I believed what I was feeling even though I was far away from the prophet
    <br>because of the energy in that place.
    <br>The prayer was like a flood and that was when I started believing what I had seen the previous day.

    <br>I am a scientist and I believed in miracles but not to that extent.
    <br>I had tried finding many solutions for my knees.
    <br>Physically, I used to do a lot of exercise but I had to stop; I could no longer go cycling.
    <br>I could not walk long distances and I couldn't bend my knees freely.
    <br>I could only move a little bit, not with the kind of energy and vigour I wanted to.
    <br>Before, when I would climb stairs, my kneecaps would make noise
    <br>and I would feel chills from my toes to my head.
    <br>I had this problem for about four years.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>A friend of mine is an orthopedic doctor and there are a lot of medical professionals in my family.
    <br>I went to check my knees on many occasions and I knew that the checkups were very expensive
    <br>but I believed that one day, God would heal me.
    <br>I was told I needed surgery to correct my kneecap because it had changed position.
    <br>Now, I can walk without pain or noise in my knees
    <br>Testimony From Mexico Crusade Mass Prayer
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I couldn't believe that someone could heal me or have such a huge faith that could move mountains.
    <br>From a distance, I felt heat and I raised my hands to God
    <br>and gave thanks for what He had done and for the fire that I was feeling at that moment.
    <br>The pain disappeared and now, I can bend my knees and climb stairs.
    <br>I feel the freedom to run, to ride a bike and the depression has gone.
    <br>Before, I was a really active woman who played basketball, volleyball and went cycling.
    <br>Before, I felt that I was not able to do them anymore; it was like my world was collapsing
    <br>but now, I feel that I can do them; I feel like I am born again.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>The next day was Mother's Day and I was with my family
    <br>and told them everything that I saw, experienced and felt.
    <br>I wanted to jump and spontaneously tell everyone what I saw.
    <br>I want people to believe the same way I do.
    <br>Since the first day of the crusade, up till the sixth day after which was a Wednesday,
    <br>I realised that I did not smoke.
    <br>Since Friday of the crusade, I have not smoked a single cigarette.
    <br>I no longer find it necessary to smoke a cigarette in order to calm down.
    <br>I feel less stressed. I was smoking since I was 15 years old.
    <br>I stopped for one year but then went back to smoking for four years.
    <br>I was praying to God to help me stop smoking but I did not really want to leave smoking.
    <br>There was a mental excuse to smoke but thank God, He helped me say, 'goodbye' to cigarettes.
    <br>I left the cigarettes without any emotional or mental craving for the nicotine.

    <br>Now, I can bend my legs and knees; I can squat, walk freely and jump.
    <br>Testimony From Mexico Crusade Mass Prayer
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I am no longer feeling any pain.
    <br>I believe he really is a prophet and has the authority of a prophet and the fire.
    <br>I am a scientist and I know that science is the language which God used to write the universe.
    <br>What I saw and experienced came from God.
    <br>Definitely, I don't put my faith in a man but his life is an example of obedience to God
    <br>and the faith that he has to move mountains.
    <br>Testimony From Mexico Crusade Mass Prayer
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>What I learned was to love people with the love of Christ.
    <br>My temper used to be chloric and sanguine and is becoming more calm.
    <br>Now, because of the perfect love of Christ, I do not react the way I used to.
    <br>The stress has calmed down and I believe that it was only made possible
    <br>through the love of God and faith.
    <br>The prophet is an example of how we can conduct ourselves in the love of God.
    <br>The prophet preached, love your neighbour and love God so that is something I learned
    <br>and it is something I am now using in my life.
    <br>As a Christian, I know that people are going to see in us the example of Christ
    <br>and I think that is the most valuable lesson that I saw that day.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Before, I could not do this - bend my knees and move my legs.
    <br>My knees used to have a clicking noise but now, there is no more pain.
