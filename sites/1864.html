  <p>    
    <br>Thousands of people from South Korea and all other parts of the world have flocked to The SCOAN,
    <br>having witnessed what Jesus Christ has been doing through the life of His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They have come to see the proof that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>They wait in faith to receive the benefits of Calvary that Jesus Christ bought for us:
    <br>Healing in Jesus' name that will eradicate all their sicknesses and diseases.
    <br>The anointing of Jesus Christ begins to flow through the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to break every yoke in the lives of the people,
    <br>in accordance with 1 Peter 2:24, "By His wounds, we are healed".
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers to the people in Jesus' name, the joy of salvation is restored
    <br>as their cares and burdens are cast unto the Lord.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua continued praying for the people, he finally reaches Mr Hong Seong Hoon
    <br>and prays the prayer of faith; and instantly Jesus Christ comes to the scene.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit, continues ministering prayer
    <br>and a divine operation continues to unravel the problem in the life of Mr Hong Seong Hoon.
    <br>The lumbar corset is removed from Mr Hong Seong Hoon, the final stages of his healing take place,
    <br>and the supernatural power of God brings health to his flesh.
    <br>All the punishment that Jesus Christ received before and during His crucifixion
    <br>was for our healing - spirit, soul and body.

    <br>The lumbar corset is no longer needed as Mr Hong Seong Hoon's problems of chronic lumbar instability,
    <br>hip joint disease, frequent urination, asthma and others have been nailed to the Cross of Calvary, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The power of resurrection continues to release into his body like a breath of fresh air,
    <br>bringing life anew to his blood, bones, tendons and fluids - all receive life anew.
    <br>Jesus, the Son of God, healed all manners of sickness and disease.
    <br>His Words are made health to all our flesh.
    <br>It does not matter whether cancer, goitre, tumour or chronic lumbar instability,
    <br>God says, "Health to all flesh."
    <br>Mr Hong Seong Hoon is healed and rises to his feet.
    <br>The father walks over and greets Prophet T.B. Joshua, thanking Jesus Christ for healing his son.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Mr Hong Seong Hoon exercises his body to the glory of God.
    <br>These are the things he could not do before the prayer,
    <br>but now he walks confidently and freely to the glory of God.
    <br>My name is Hong Seong Hoon from South Korea.
    <br>I had a road traffic accident three years ago.
    <br>I suffered from back pain and headaches.
    <br>Before, I used this [lumbar corset] but now I throw it away.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Victory is mine
    <br>Victory is only mine
    <br>I always win by the Blood of Jesus

    <br>Victory is mine
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Mr Hong Seong Hoon walks into the room completely renewed in spirit, soul and body
    <br>and rejoices with the people of God for his miraculous healing.
    <br>He exercises his body, testifying to the complete and perfect healing.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let us listen to his testimony.

    <br>The doctor said there was no solution.
    <br>We saw that you were prayed for by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, in the prayer line.
    <br>Can you tell us, what was your experience in the prayer line?

    <br>After he prayed for me, I could do those things that I could not do before.
    <br>I felt the power of God and found myself doing what I was unable to do before.

    <br>I am very fine; I don't feel pain anymore!
    <br>Previously, I couldn't sleep, not even for two hours.
    <br>But now, I can sleep very well, even up to 10 hours.
    <br>I can move easily; my condition is excellent.

    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Mr Hong Seong Hoon rises to his feet
    <br>and demonstrates his freedom of movement after the healing.
    <br>This is indeed a radical transformation from his former life of pain, discomfort and restriction.
    <br>He can now enjoy his life with good health.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am going back to Korea; I will sin no more and walk in the way of the Lord.
    <br>AMAZING MIRACLE: Korean Car Crash Victim Walks Again!!! ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>About this back brace, can you tell us, do you need to use this anymore?
    <br>I don't want to use it anymore.
