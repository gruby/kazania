    <br>Mr Celsius Ukpong has come to The Synagogue Church of all Nations to receive prayer
    <br>over the problem of a terrible skin disease.
    <br>Moving down his right leg,  you begin to see the painful lesions,
    <br>discolorations and marks of the incredibly painful disease.
    <br>The skin affliction proceeds all the way down to the soles of his feet
    <br>which are raw and wounded in places where the disease has worn away the skin.
    <br>The horrible disease covers his entire foot,
    <br>right up to the ends of his toes and under the toenails.
    <br>In this condition, simple actions like sitting, lying down or walking become immensely discomfortable
    <br>and bathing becomes an unbearable torture.
    <br>Let us hear from Mr Ukpong how this has affected his life.
    <br>Please tell us your name, your age and where you are from.
    <br>Celsius Ukpong, I am from Akwa Ibom 
    <br>state, I'm 43 years old.
    <br>What is the problem that has brought you to The Synagogue Church of All Nations today?
    <br>I've been having this skin disease.
    <br>And how has this problem affected your life?
    <br>It has affected my life in several ways.
    <br>For example, I am unable to go to work now; there is severe agonizing pain.
    <br>I have been on high pain killers without success.
    <br>I have been to several hospitals and several churches without a solution.
    <br>In fact, I am a walking corpse as I'm talking to you now because of the agonizing pain.
    <br>And now that you are here, what do you believe God Almighty is going to do for you?
    <br>I want to be healed completely from this malady.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>I am a walking corpse, have mercy
    <br> on me. I have been suffering.
    <br>I have agonizing pains. I can't go to bed; I am a walking corpse.
    <br>All my veins are dead, and I have skin lesions all over my body.
    <br>They have refused to go.
    <br>They are so painful, so agonizing.
    <br>All over my skin. Right from here, 
    <br>to all my toes, everything.
    <br>The healing is for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>This sickness is not meant to destroy you
    <br>but to strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>Okay, so that is it.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua instructs Mr Celsius to rise to his feet
    <br>and ministers the Anointing Water to him with immediate effect.
    <br>Watch his face as the divine operation of the Holy Spirit uproots the cause of his problem
    <br>and casts it out through the Anointing Water.
    <br>God is busy using the medium of the Anointing Water
    <br>to transform his situation from sickness to good health.
    <br>If you look at him by faith, you will see something coming out.
    <br>Coming out like a flame.
    <br>Restoring him back to the original position in which God made him.
    <br>Look here! Put down your hands.
    <br>You are free!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>I am healed. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Glory to God in the highest.
    <br>Mr Celsius Ukpong returned triumphantly to The Synagogue Church of All Nations
    <br>to declare the goodness and favour of the Lord in his life.
    <br>On the left, you can see how he came with a terrible skin disease all over his leg and foot.
    <br>And on the right, with his trousers rolled up,
    <br>you can see the now perfect condition of Mr Ukpong's body
    <br>after his encounter with Jesus Christ at The Synagogue Church of All Nations.
    <br>The skin of his feet is beautifully restored back to normal
    <br>and all signs of the inflammation and disease have completely gone.
    <br>And he sits peacefully without any agitation or discomfort.
    <br>Let's hear from him how he feels now.
    <br>My legs are normal. I feel no pain; there is nothing like pain.
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>I'm okay, I'm all right.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>I am Celsius Ukpong.
    <br>I'm a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN about three years ago
    <br>on this problem you saw on the screen - the problem of a skin disease.
    <br>The problem you saw there ravished my whole body.
    <br>If I had removed my clothes then, you could have seen the symptoms.
    <br>I had this intense Inflammation that tended to explode my right leg.
    <br>I could not eat, sleep or do other things I wanted to do.
    <br>If you saw it on the screen, there was a very dark spot there.
    <br>It was part of those diseases.
    <br>There was nowhere too big for me to go, and nowhere too small for me to go.
    <br>I did everything. I exhausted my native intelligence.
    <br>If you come to my house, you won't know I'm a lawyer.
    <br>you would think I'm a medical doctor because I bought many medical books,
    <br>trying to read in order to find solutions because I lost faith completely
    <br>in what the doctors could do.
    <br>Before I came to The SCOAN, I was on a cocktail of drugs.
    <br>When you are on a cocktail of drugs, it means everything has failed
    <br>so your doctors are trying to put things together to make you survive.
    <br>That was the situation I was in before I came here.
    <br>Nothing was working.
    <br>It was too agonizing.
    <br>When I came here and Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me,
    <br>immediately the disease, inflammation and agonizing pain vanished.
    <br>As I'm speaking to you now, nothing like that has resurfaced.
    <br>All the dark spots that were on my body have retreated and I am well and strong.
    <br>And I can attend to my duties as I used to do.
    <br>Happily testifying, Mr Celsius Ukpong removes his sock and shoe
    <br>to show the place where the skin disease had once been.
    <br>His skin has been restored through the miraculous power of our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>through the Anointing Water.
    <br>When I came to Lagos, in fact, the pain was so much
    <br>that they brought a wheelchair to bring me down from the plane; I could not walk.
    <br>But all those things that I could not do, right now, I can do them again.
    <br>This is the leg; an evidence to show that those things are not flukes
    <br>and it was what I experienced before I came to this place.
    <br>I am free and able to do all those things I could not do.
    <br>Even my job that was on the line has been restored.
    <br>It is as if nothing had happened because at that time,
    <br>while the sickness was pursuing me this way, my job was on the line to be destroyed.
    <br>But all those things have returned completely.
    <br>I'm living my normal life.
    <br>Stamping his foot on the ground, Mr Celsius feels no pain.
    <br>He is healed indeed.
    <br>There is nothing wrong with this leg now.
    <br>I am free! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>He walked to and fro smoothly and smartly,
    <br>with no fear of any pain or discomfort.
    <br>What a miracle.
    <br>There is nothing God cannot do,
    <br>especially if you are privileged to meet a genuine man of God.
    <br>I met the so-called witch doctors that
    <br>told me several things about this leg
    <br>but they could not profer solutions.
    <br>So when you face this kind of a storming blast,
    <br>what you should do is to seek out where you can have your salvation
    <br>through the instrumentality of a man of God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is a jewel; people should listen to his counsel and accept his prayers
    <br>because whatsoever he says, that is how it will come to be.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
