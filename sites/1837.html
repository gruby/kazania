    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We pray God should lead us, guide us, going by the message:
    <br>WORKS OF FAITH
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's quickly look at the shortest text in the Bible about faith.
    <br>The Book of Hebrews, chapter 11, verse 1, verse 3, and as the Spirit directs.
    <br>"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for,
    <br>the evidence of things not seen."
    <br>In a simple nutshell, faith is a heart that believes God.
    <br>Regardless of which translation we prefer,
    <br>faith deals with things we cannot see.
    <br>The vital point is that faith deals with things we cannot see.
    <br>I mean, faith relates to the invisible.
    <br>I mean, we can have different routes, but we arrive at the point.
    <br>The vital point is that faith deals with things we cannot see.
    <br>Faith relates to the invisible.
    <br>That is in the same place in Hebrews - let's look at verse 3 there.
    <br>"By faith we understand that the world was formed by the Word of God.
    <br>So that the things that were seen, were not made of things which are visible."
    <br>Here, the things that are seen and the things that are not seen.
    <br>I mean, between the visible and the invisible.
    <br>Our senses locate us to the visible world.
    <br>Our senses point us to the visible world.
    <br>I mean, to what is seen.
    <br>Faith in the actual sense takes us behind the visible to the invisible.
    <br>This is visible, where you are now.
    <br>Faith takes us behind the visible here, to the invisible.
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>2 Corinthians 5:7
    <br>Paul brought to us the opposition between faith and sight.
    <br>For we walk by faith not by sight.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>If Paul said we walk by faith not by sight,
    <br>this means, if you walk by faith, you do not need sight.
    <br>If we walk by faith, we do not need sight
    <br>and if we walk by sight, we do not need faith.
    <br>If we walk by faith, we do not need sight
    <br>and if we walk by sight, we do not need faith.
    <br>That is, we walk by faith not by sight.
    <br>Faith is related solely and exclusively to two realities -
    <br>to God and to God's Word.
    <br>This is contrary to our natural way of thinking.
    <br>The world says, "Seeing is believing" but the Bible reverses the order.
    <br>First, we must believe, then see.
    <br>The Bible reverses the order.
    <br>First, we must believe, then see.
    <br>We do not see, then believe.
    <br>But we believe first, then see.
    <br>As a result of our believing, we see.
    <br>Let's quickly look into the Book of John 11:40.
    <br>"Jesus said to her, 'Did I not say to you that if you would believe
    <br>you would see the glory of God?' "
    <br>'If you believe' not, 'If you see'.
    <br>If you believe, you will see that glory of God.
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>This means, if you cannot believe, you cannot see, as a Christian.
    <br>If you cannot believe, you cannot see the glory of God,
    <br>the goodness of God, the healing of God, the blessing and deliverance of God.
    <br>If you cannot believe, you will not see the goodness of God.
    <br>The thing that keeps us from despairing is not what we see but what we believe.
    <br>Let me give you a good example of 'I - T.B. Joshua'; how this faith works in my life.
    <br>In spite of all the persecution, condemnation, antagonism - just name them - against me,
    <br>I endured, because I was able to see the unseen.
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>How did I do this?
    <br>By faith.
    <br>Faith enables us to see the unseen
    <br>and thus, enables us to endure
    <br>when the world offers us no hope or encouragement.
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>When you people were persecuting me, saying all sorts of things against me,
    <br>I was looking beyond what you were saying.
    <br>I looked beyond now and I saw the glory of God.
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>When you were saying this, that, "Over your dead body" would you come to The SCOAN...
    <br>When you were watching Emmanuel TV then, you said, "Switch if off. I don't want to watch this channel."
    <br>I was looking beyond what you were saying, seeing you coming to The Synagogue.
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>When you were somewhere doing vigil, rebuking T.B. Joshua,
    <br>praying against T.B. Joshua, bound and loosed T.B. Joshua,
    <br>I was looking beyond that exercise,
    <br>seeing you coming to say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>That was the reason why I could not also rebuke you and bind you.
    <br>I knew you were coming.
    <br>When you were saying all sorts of things against the ministry, Emmanuel TV, this church,
    <br>I knew you were coming and I was praying for you.
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Faith enables us to see the unseen
    <br>and thus, enables us to endure when the visible world offers us no hope, no encouragement.
    <br>Without faith, you will continue to commit the Word of God to memory.
    <br>You will read the Bible, know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation
    <br>but all will be committed to where?
    <br>We call it - 'brain -power'.
    <br>Say, 'brain - power'.
    <br>Brain - power.
    <br>There is supernatural power of God and there is natural one - 'brain - power',
    <br>the one you study in the school.
    <br>Everything you study is committed here.
    <br>That is why if you call the first degree to sit for a secondary school examination, he will likely fail.
    <br>He will be the 'first class' because he has dropped that;
    <br>as he moved forward he dropped them.
    <br>If you don't drop them, you can't commit the whole thing to memory, you can't make it.
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>When we read without the help of the Holy Spirit, we commit this to memory.
    <br>But by faith, we not only commit to memory
    <br>but let the Word become an integral part of our being
    <br>because it lives in you.
    <br>Can you see the difference now?
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Without faith, you will read the Word of God and commit it to memory
    <br>but by faith, you not only commit the Word to memory
    <br>but let the Word become an integral part of your being
    <br>because it lives in us."
    <br>HOW I ENDURE PERSECUTION!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>This is why you can see everyone today coming out to preach the Word of God, "Jesus is Lord!".
    <br>From Genesis to Revelation people can quote them verse by verse.
    <br>When they preach, some will say, "Oh my God. This is the author of the Bible."
    <br>But it is all committed to what?
    <br>That 'brain - power'.
    <br>This is why when you see many today, we have to go to the point and look at what they are preaching.
    <br>Either in a laptop, or whatever you see people carrying, because the word is there.
    <br>We talk of senses.
    <br>We have two natures.
    <br>The old nature, the old way of life demands to see
    <br>because it lives by the senses.
    <br>'Flesh' should have been translated to 'senses',
    <br>so that you understand it well.
    <br>'Flesh' should have been translated to 'senses'.
    <br>The sins of the flesh are the sins of the senses.
    <br>As we know those five senses: feeling, smell, sight, taste...
    <br>"Because I tasted the thing, I know it is sweet."
    <br>"I struck the thing - I know it is hard."
    <br>"The thing is fragile because I smelled it."
    <br>Old nature, old way of life demands to see because it lives by the senses.
