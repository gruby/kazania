    <br>God Is Still Saying Something
    <br>During The SCOAN Live Sunday Service on January 3rd, 2016, Prophet T.B. Joshua revealed
    <br>the mind of God concerning Southern Africa.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>First of all, Southern Africa, if I may talk to South Africa.
    <br>There will be a little rain at the wrong time which is not good for farming.
    <br>Many farmers will be discouraged.
    <br>That is Southern Africa.
    <br>When I say, "Southern Africa", the whole thing will shoot from South Africa.
    <br>In that vision, I was asking God, "What is the way out?
    <br>What can we do in Southern Africa, majorly in South Africa?"
    <br>The Lord showed me that the government should be encouraged by building dams.
    <br>They should be able to invest in dams and irrigation mechanisms,
    <br>using available water from the sea.
    <br>This will also affect power supply.
    <br>You will see the power supply becoming epileptic.
    <br>As time goes on, it will be very serious.
    <br>Epileptic means, it is today, it is not tomorrow.
    <br>It may be very serious.
