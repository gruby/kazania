    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>During the time I was in the mountain, I knew you were praying for me.
    <br>Thank you for your love and thank you for your prayer.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>It is time for prayer.
    <br>Right now, believe that God wants to heal you.
    <br>Believe that God wants to save you.
    <br>Believe that God wants to bless you.
    <br>Believe that God wants to deliver you, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Right now, stand in faith.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>We serve a God who still heals, who still delivers, who still blesses.
    <br>Begin to choose faith over fear, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I pray for the system of the body that has been affected by COVID-19,
    <br>whatever virus, whatever affliction - be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever virus, affliction, sickness, disease -
    <br>I command you - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave that body, leave that blood, leave that organ, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Leave, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Heal the sick, Lord!
    <br>Touch those with COVID-19!
    <br>Whatever virus, affliction, sickness, disease - touch them now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Touch them now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever virus, disease, affliction - never a sickness, disease Jesus cannot heal, Jesus cannot cure!
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Touch them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>To the doctors, nurses, caregivers - what a calling, what a career!
    <br>Imagine without you at this critical time.
    <br>Bless them now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let them know that their labour is not in vain, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus, whatever that will prevent them from serving -
    <br>be it discouragement - speak to it, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be it fear of COVID-19 - speak to it, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be it affliction, be it whatever virus, be it hardship, difficulty - speak to it, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Those on the sickbed - whatever challenges, whatever virus, whatever affliction, COVID-19 -
    <br>Your Word declares - be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your Word declares - be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your Word declares - be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
    <br>To our partners all over the world, we see the manner and the way
    <br>you have allowed yourselves to be used for the glory of God.
    <br>Lord Jesus, bless them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Bless them in a tremendous way, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord!
    <br>We thank You for increasing their capacity to serve and show Your love and Your care,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, determine to set aside time to read your Bible
    <br>and take to meditation, as we have listened to today.
    <br>Meditation means to focus only on one thing - God's Word.
    <br>The Word of God can only become part of us by meditation.
    <br>Take note.
    <br>Set aside a special time, pondering over the Word of God.
    <br>May God bless you.
    <br>Don't forget, this prayer, this counselling is not time-bound.
    <br>Anytime you hear it, the power of God is maintained, the glory of God is maintained.
    <br>Thank you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
