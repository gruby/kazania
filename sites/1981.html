    <br>Words That Works Wonders - tell your neighbour.
    <br>Words That Works Wonders
    <br>You need to focus only on what God has to say about your situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Focus only on what God has to say about your situation."
    <br>Many situations here may be to stop them awhile
    <br>in order to prepare them for the challenges ahead.
    <br>Some situations are meant to keep them for a new level in life.
    <br>Some are meant to stop them in order to reform them for a better position.
    <br>Some are meant to strengthen their desire for God only.
    <br>If your prayer for a better condition had been answered,
    <br>who knows what would have happened to you today?
    <br>"I want to be this, that. I want to be a governor, senator, president.
    <br>I want to buy a new car, house, to be a rich man."
    <br>If that prayer had been answered, who knows what would have happened to you?
    <br>Words That Works Wonders - tell your neighbour.
    <br>Romans 10:10,
    <br>"For with the heart one believes unto righteousness,
    <br>and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
    <br>With the heart one believes.
    <br>Confession is part of salvation just as believing is part.
    <br>Believing is part of salvation just as confession is part.
    <br>Words that work miracles, I mean, words that work wonders.
    <br>Words of confession of God's Word indeed work wonders.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Words of confession of God's Word indeed work wonders."
    <br>I mean, words spoken in harmony with God's Word work wonders.
    <br>The confession of your lips should have the heart's full agreement,
    <br>because confession is part of salvation just as believing is part.
    <br>The confession of your lips should have the heart's full agreement.
    <br>Our confession must absolutely agree with God's Word.
    <br>"In Jesus' name..."
    <br>If you have prayed in Jesus' name, you have to hold fast your confession.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of John 15:7.
    <br>"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,
    <br>you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you."
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>His Word abiding in us gives us an authority in Heaven.
    <br>Your word can become one with God's Word
    <br>and God's Word can become one with your word.
    <br>Forever O Lord
    <br>Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>Forever O Lord
    <br>Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>If you see a good doctor, when you take him to the laboratory,
    <br>you will see the real value of him.
    <br>The Word of God is clear.
    <br>If you go by what is written in the Bible, when God is off you, you can know
    <br>and when God is with you, you can know.
    <br>When God talks, power talks.
    <br>When God walks, power walks.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>When God is beside you, you can know.
    <br>When God is before you, you can know.
    <br>When God marches, power marches.
    <br>When God knows, power knows.
    <br>When God looks, power looks.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>He said here, once again I read,
    <br>"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,
    <br>you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you."
    <br>The Bible says your words can become one with God's Word
    <br>and God's Word can become one with your words.
    <br>His Word abiding in you gives you an authority in Heaven.
    <br>Whatever you loose shall be loosed in Heaven
    <br>and whatever you bind shall be bound in Heaven.
    <br>Whatever you want shall be wanted in Heaven.
    <br>Every God's Word is Spirit and Life
    <br>and will work in us when we receive and attend to it.
    <br>This visible word, "In Jesus' name" - I say, "In Jesus' name" - that is what you hear me saying.
    <br>This visible word gives faith in the unseen Word.
    <br>When I say, "In the name of Jesus Christ",
    <br>that command is an expression of my faith in God.
    <br>If I say, "In the name of Jesus, be healed" and nothing happens,
    <br>it shows I have faith in faith, not faith in God.
    <br>There is what you call faith in faith and also faith in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>When we pronounce the words, "In the name of Jesus" it is the same,
    <br>but when God affects my words, it brings results.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>This visible word gives faith in the unseen Word sitting at the right hand of God.
    <br>This visible word we pronounce everyday, "In Jesus' name" -
    <br>if this visible word is born of faith,
    <br>it will give faith in the unseen Word sitting at the right hand of God.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Divine faith, when it is expressed, it is a force
    <br>that has God behind it for its accomplishment.
    <br>When you say, "In Jesus' name" and what you are saying is born of faith,
    <br>God follows it to make is happen, to make it work.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>But when you express faith in faith, you just say it and it will remain on your lips.
    <br>People will say you said it well in the visible.
    <br>But remember, not only Bartimaeus shouted, "Son of David, have mercy on me."
    <br>There were many other blind men and women there but Jesus never heard them,
    <br>but only blind Bartimaeus.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Isaiah 53:5,
    <br>"But He was wounded for our transgressions...
    <br>... and by His wounds we are healed."
    <br>The Word declares that by His stripes we were healed.
    <br>We believers do not ask to be healed because we have been healed.
    <br>It is not good taste to ask God to heal us, for He has already done it.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Surely He took up our infirmities
    <br>He carried our sorrows
    <br>As we considered Him
    <br>Stricken by God
    <br>Smitten by men
    <br>And He went for us
    <br>By His wounds we are healed
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>We believers do not ask to be healed because we have been healed.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Is that true for your life?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>The whole problem is our recognition of the absolute truthfulness of that Word -
    <br>'by His wounds'.
    <br>The only problem now is to get in perfect harmony with His Word.
    <br>The Bible is saying here in Isaiah 53:5 that we do not ask to be healed
    <br>because we have been healed.
    <br>We do not ask to be redeemed for our redemption is absolute - a fact.
    <br>My confession always precedes my possession.
    <br>Salvation follows confession.
    <br>Our healing follows our confession.
    <br>A negative confession precedes possession of wrong things.
    <br>When I order my words alright,
    <br>God manifests to me the benefits of His great salvation.
    <br>In that Book of Romans 10:10:
    <br>With the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.
    <br>With my mouth, I make confession unto salvation,
    <br>which includes healing, deliverance, salvation and all of God's blessings.
    <br>I know also that words work blunders.
    <br>For most of us - most of our troubles are tongue troubles.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Most of our troubles are tongue troubles."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>With the mouth, confession can be made unto sickness.
    <br>With the mouth, confession can be made unto defeat.
    <br>With the mouth, confession can be made unto setback.
    <br>With the mouth, confession can be made unto failure.
    <br>Tell our neighbour, "I refuse to make a bad confession."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I refuse to make a bad confession]
    <br>because Someone is watching out for me.
    <br>I refuse to make a bad confession
    <br>because Someone is listening to my praise.
    <br>I refuse to make a bad confession.
    <br>Begin to confess whom you are.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>The Word you have in your hand carries you beyond sense knowledge
    <br>into the very presence of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I refuse to make a bad confession."
    <br>The Word you have in your hand carries you beyond sense knowledge,
    <br>what you see, what you hear, what others tell you, what your situation now looks like.
    <br>David was looking at a giant.
    <br>A rustic boy, inexperienced boy, was looking at a giant man with full experience of warfare
    <br>but he refused to make a bad confession.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The Bible says he looked beyond sense knowledge.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I refuse to make a bad confession
    <br>because Someone is listening to my praise."
    <br>I refuse to make a bad confession
    <br>because Someone is watching out for me.
    <br>I refuse...
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>How can I talk sickness, when the Bible says in the Book of Isaiah 53:5, "By His wounds..."?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "How can I talk sickness
    <br>when the Bible says, 'By His wounds, I am healed'? "
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>How can I, T.B. Joshua, talk sickness, when the Bible says, "By His wounds, I..." ?
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Because you are a believer does not mean you cannot fall sick.
    <br>As a believer you can have sickness, but that sickness is not like others'.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>That you are a believer does not mean you cannot face hardship
    <br>but that hardship is not like others'.
    <br>Yours is meant to stop you a while
    <br>in order to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>That you are a believer does not mean you cannot face trial.
    <br>The Bible says that everyone that walks by faith will have testing.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>But yours is not like others'.
    <br>Others' is unto death, unto destruction, but yours is for the glory of God.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>How can I talk weakness, when the Bible says in Psalm 27:1,
    <br>"The Lord is my strength"?
    <br>How can I talk defeat, when the Bible says, "We are more than conquerors"?
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>We are more than conquerors through Christ.
    <br>How can I talk bondage, when the Bible says in the Book of John 8:36,
    <br>"The Son has set me free"?
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>How can I talk lack, "I have no money, I have nothing, I am in debt..."
    <br>How can I talk lack?
    <br>My God shall supply all my needs.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to confess who you are in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I am healed. Jesus is my Healer.
    <br>I am delivered. Jesus is my Deliverer.
    <br>I am redeemed. Jesus is my Redeemer.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>With the mouth, confession can be made unto sickness.
    <br>Most of our troubles are tongue troubles
    <br>because with the mouth, confession can be made unto failure.
    <br>No one ever rises above his confession.
    <br>Your confession is what God says about your situation.
    <br>With my mouth, I make confession unto salvation, which includes healing,
    <br>deliverance and all of God's blessings.
    <br>This means, by words I overcome satan.
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of Ephesians 6:17 that
    <br>those who overcome satan will be required
    <br>to use the power of  the spoken Word.
    <br>The spoken Word is the sword of the Spirit in the Christian's armour.
    <br>Remember, Jesus spoke aloud directly to satan in the wilderness.
    <br>"You shall not live by bread alone.
    <br>Satan, leave me."
    <br>If you have a mountain of a problem,
    <br>you must speak directly to the problem.
    <br>WORDS THAT WORK WONDERS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you have a mountain of a problem,
    <br>speak directly to the problem."
