    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Climbing the mountain of prayer, the congregation lay their challenges at the feet of Jesus.
    <br>They have come with different sicknesses and diseases and Jesus heals them all.
    <br>Lumbar corsets are removed, as the healing power of Jesus Christ speaks life to dry bones.
    <br>Neck collars are removed, as movements in strength are restored, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Pay attention to this gentleman in white, as he prays on the altar
    <br>and rubs the various parts of his body.
    <br>Suddenly, we see tears in his eyes and an expression of shock on his face, as he prays.
    <br>Let's find out what is happening.
    <br>Sir, what is happening to you?
    <br>I was supposed to have anal surgery at 37 Military Hospital in Accra, Ghana.
    <br>Look at me!
    <br>For three years - an operation in my anus.
    <br>Anal surgery.
    <br>It is gone.
    <br>Look at me!
    <br>I am a lecturer at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.
    <br>I am also the former head of procurement in the Ministry of Finance of Ghana.
    <br>I handled procurement and logistics for them.
    <br>Now, I am in the classroom because of this problem.
    <br>My whole anus was seized.
    <br>The whole place seized entirely for three years.
    <br>If I had to defecate, they would use hot water to penetrate.
    <br>If I went to the toilet - blood.
    <br>After defecating, I would have to sit down for four hours before I could get up.
    <br>I could not walk at the speed that I am walking now.
    <br>You mean you were not even able to sit down like this?
    <br>Look at me; I couldn't sit down.
    <br>I could not lecture standing for long hours.
    <br>Look at me; can you see me?
    <br>Look at me!
    <br>This is unbelievable!
    <br>It's a miracle!
    <br>I can't believe it because I couldn't sit like this.
    <br>I couldn't even stand for long hours.
    <br>I climbed on this altar - look at me!
    <br>I am seated. I can hit myself; look at me!
    <br>Something just melted within me - within the anus.
    <br>Something just melted as if something pushed out from my anus.
    <br>Everything is finished now.
    <br>Everything has vanished.
    <br>Look at me!
    <br>Can this person be going for surgery?
    <br>I was supposed to have a surgery.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>I am Yaw Kush Alexander, former head of procurement and logistics in the Ministry of Health, Ghana,
    <br>currently a lecturer at Kwame Nkruma University of Science & Technology.
    <br>I lecture at the Masters level, MSc and MPhil, leading to the PhD.
    <br>I am also a trainer at the Ministry of Finance, the ITS, Accra -
    <br>that's where I currently am.
    <br>This is my beautiful wife, who stood by me in all this.
    <br>That's my daughter, in fact, my second child.
    <br>This one is my last boy.
    <br>The last one I named after Prophet T.B. Joshua - his name is Joshua Kush.
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>By the special grace of God I found myself here.
    <br>When I came here, I rehearsed the prayer that was given to me by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>"Let Your opulent mercy give me proof of Your loving kindness.
    <br>Let Your opulent mercy give me proof of Your steadfast love.
    <br>Let Your opulent mercy give me proof of Your undeserved favour.
    <br>Let Your opulent mercy give me proof of Your extravagant grace."
    <br>I continued rehearsing it.
    <br>When you talk about anal seizure or closure, due to many other conditions which caused it...
    <br>I could not sit to continue doing my work,
    <br>handling sensitive contract matters in the Ministry of Ghana -
    <br>you know what it must mean.
    <br>I couldn't sit down, even for a minute or two.
    <br>When studying the situation, they saw it as a hazard at the work site, 
    <br>so I had to be released into the training school, as a lecturer.
    <br>When you go to the school, they will tell you what happened last semester.
    <br>I could not perform my duties.
    <br>How could I lecture standing?
    <br>I couldn't stand; I can't lecture lying down.
    <br>I couldn't sit down to do my work at the Ministry of Finance.
    <br>I couldn't stand to lecture.
    <br>It was a huge problem.
    <br>If I had to go to the toilet, or evacuate, it was horrible.
    <br>My wife would have to prepare hot water, find a way of pushing enema.
    <br>It was so hard to be able to get it to my system.
    <br>The extent of heat in my system forces and opens it;
    <br>that was what the surgeons told us.
    <br>When it opens up, I evacuate with blood and everything.
    <br>I go so helpless for the next four hours to get back myself.
    <br>All my strength is gone, everything is gone.
    <br>You have to clean me of blood and everything.
    <br>After four hours they have to encourage me.
    <br>In fact, people in the training school can testify to this.
    <br>Finally four prominent surgeons in Ghana gave me the solution.
    <br>The solution was anal surgery.
    <br>When I asked to know more about the anal surgery, they told me there is no '100% surgery'.
    <br>The chance was fifty-fifty.
    <br>This gave me worry.
    <br>Look at my beautiful wife and children.
    <br>How could I go through this surgery?
    <br>Deep down in me, I was not comfortable.
    <br>In my confusion and discomfort about signing the document for my surgery, I had a dream.
    <br>This dream changed everything.
    <br>I saw myself like a dead person - three weeks, very black,
    <br>on a mortuary palette, being carried by two people;
    <br>a fetish priestess and somebody that looked like my late father,
    <br>down into the deepest oceans,
    <br>and under the ocean was a cave.
    <br>This cave was covered with a white tent.
    <br>I was surprised to meet these kind of people under the water.
    <br>They pushed me inside.
    <br>And these two people were guarding the gates.
    <br>I don't know what was the next thing they were going to do.
    <br>They thought I was dead but I was alive.
    <br>Then, all of a sudden, I heard something like thunder, but it was not thunder.
    <br>The thunder sounds like...,
    <br>but this one was...
    <br>It came with a violent vigour.
    <br>Then, it took my attention.
    <br>Their reaction was like a tsunami and everybody was running helter-skelter.
    <br>They were all scattered.
    <br>I was left alone there.
    <br>Then I watched the direction from where the sound and the tsunami was coming from.
    <br>Then I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua standing on the beach.
    <br>I had hope immediately.
    <br>Then, he took a step towards me.
    <br>He stepped on the tsunami.
    <br>When he stepped, there was total calmness at some distance.
    <br>Then he took another step - total calmness,
    <br>until he got to the place where I was.
    <br>When he got to the place I was in the tent,
    <br>suddenly he appeared in the tent and asked me a question:
    <br>Where are they?
    <br>To be sure to give Prophet T.B. Joshua an answer, I looked around
    <br>to be sure if there was anybody.
    <br>I just motioned like this to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Immediately, I saw myself on a beach island with thick greenish foliage,
    <br>with Prophet T.B. Joshua in my dream, standing at the side of me -
    <br>he was standing on my right side.
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>I woke up.
    <br>In my dream, there was no more Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>I felt the presence of God all around me.
    <br>And I felt a company that was comforting me.
    <br>I had strength and courage from them.
    <br>I asked my wife, "Can you feel this presence I am feeling? I am no more going for surgery.
    <br>Surgery is over. Pack your things, you and the children.
    <br>We are going to Prophet T.B. Joshua!"
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>So it was after that dream, that you decided to attend the Living Water Service?
    <br>Yes. She gave me the confirmation.
    <br>She managed to get a professional to fix Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and there was a Living Water Service on the 27th.
    <br>We all need deliverance, including me.
    <br>I was determined to go, but my wife started making excuses.
    <br>I said, "We are going there."
    <br>The medical professors advised me passionately to accept the surgery,
    <br>because that was the one and only way for me to live.
    <br>So now tell us, when you finally came to The SCOAN and attended the Living Water Service -
    <br>what happened?
    <br>When I got to the top there, I laid down.
    <br>When I laid down, I started to roll.
    <br>As I rolled, I did like this with both hands.
    <br>I rubbed my head, and then my anus,
    <br>"Let Your opulent mercy give me Your love and kindness.
    <br>Let Your opulent mercy show me Your steadfast love.
    <br>Let Your opulent mercy give me Your extravagant grace."
    <br>I was just repeating those things.
    <br>As I was repeating, I heard a heat wave down in my anus...
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>Then I heard... as if somebody was loosing a knot - it was loosed from my anus.
    <br>Then, as they were loosing it..., it was going in another direction.
    <br>Then I heard 'Boom'.
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>This 'Boom' I heard sounded like a bomb blast in the military armoury.
    <br>In fact, I felt like, "Look, what a disgrace. A lecturer came to a holy ground,
    <br>the altar of the man of God. How can I? Abomination!"
    <br>So, I stood up to check myself, whether I disgraced myself and everybody around.
    <br>When I sat down, I realised there was no more pain.
    <br>So, when you heard that noise, you thought you defecated on...
    <br>On myself!
    <br>That is what you thought?
    <br>When I checked, there was nothing at all.
    <br>Even the smell of defecation was not there.
    <br>So, I checked to make sure - there was nothing!
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>So, when I did that self-testing, and I realised I had not defecated on myself,
    <br>then I wanted people to look at me clearly and examine me critically.
    <br>When the wise man came to me, I said, "Wise man, look at me now."
    <br>Then I hit my buttocks on the ground - nothing, no shaking, no stress, no hurt, no pain!
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>Then I said, "Look at me."
    <br>And I was hitting.
    <br>They were asking me questions. I said, "Can't you see? Look at me!"
    <br>I was hitting the ground hard.
    <br>It was gone. 
    <br>Everything was gone.
    <br>And I felt they were not believing what was happening.
    <br>So, I was demonstrating with more vigour for them to see.
    <br>I had no pain.
    <br>Indeed, nothing at all.
    <br>Those were the things you could not even try then, because of the pain?
    <br>My students sent me a text that professor has misbehaved.
    <br>So tell us, ever since that experience at the mountain of prayer, when those pains went away,
    <br>how is your life?
    <br>Look at me now!
    <br>We know God has done something.
    <br>You said before you could not defecate yourself.
    <br>I couldn't even touch my buttocks.
    <br>Talk less of defecating.
    <br>Ask my wife how she managed the situation.
    <br>But after the healing, your experience, you go to the toilet and defecate freely?
    <br>Freedom!
    <br>Liberty!
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>I don't know how to explain it again.
    <br>I go to toilet normally, free.
    <br>I am overeating now.
    <br>I could not eat anything that would cause constipation.
    <br>I am overeating bread or anything now to see if I can experience it.
    <br>I go to the toilet - liberty, freedom.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>So now, with what the Lord has done, is there still any need for the operation?
    <br>Where is the need?
    <br>I can do anything.
    <br>What word of advice do you have for people listening to you all around?
    <br>Let me give everybody a word of warning.
    <br>This is from my heart.
    <br>How I got to know T.B. Joshua is related to this.
    <br>Those people who first showed me the clips, I called them this morning to look at what I am doing.
    <br>They brought various clips from the UK, destroying the man of God.
    <br>I asked them what he had done to them.
    <br>They said, "Nothing".
    <br>I asked them why they were showing it.
    <br>They said, "Because we want you to follow us to our church."
    <br>If you have to invite me to your church, do you have to destroy somebody in order to invite me?
    <br>I went on my knees and prayed to God.
    <br>In my dream God spoke to me.
    <br>This was the first time; I heard it within me, not in my ears,
    <br>it was as if from my heart and my being, a 'still small voice':
    <br>This is My Prophet.
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>My advice to the world is to take a second look at Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am telling them this:
    <br>The philosophies, the phenomena, whatever in academia - I'm one of them -
    <br>they should examine and re-examine it again, and take a second look at Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>"LOOK AT ME!!!" | Astonishing MIRACLE For Ghanaian Lecturer! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡­
    <br>The advice is loaded.
    <br>My name is Gifty Kush.
    <br>It was a very terrible moment because he couldn't sit down or defecate.
    <br>When he visited the toilet and came back, it was like hell.
    <br>He could not even walk well and the pains were so severe, he could not sit down.
    <br>Enduring those times was very difficult.
    <br>We were buying drugs because he didn't want to do the operation.
    <br>But now we thank God; everything is fine now.
    <br>The things he was not supposed to do, he is now able to do,
    <br>because of the help of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the help of God.
    <br>Because the whole thing was coming from this position,
    <br>he could not even carry the little children when they were asleep to their bedroom.
    <br>He couldn't do or carry a lot of things.
    <br>Now, he is very fit, very strong, he can carry things, carry the children.
    <br>We thank God for that.
    <br>He said before then, you were the one who used to help him to boil the water.
    <br>We are no more using hot water.
    <br>- He goes to the toilet freely?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Without any assistance from you.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ?
    <br>The only advice I have to give to people who are listening to me is that:
    <br>for me, for instance, I always tell people that
    <br>when we are talking in terms of anointing, we have it in stages.
    <br>What I'm seeing now, I can say that if we are rating anointing 100%,
    <br>I would say Prophet T.B. Joshua is having 200%.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I always tell people that if I'm sick and I want to visit The Synagogue,
    <br>and in a particular church I am attending my pastor tells me, "Don't go",
    <br>I wouldn't listen to him, I would come,
    <br>because I know that this is the place that I will get my healing.
    <br>So, in other words you are advising everyone to trust in the Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>and He will do and give them their heart desires.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your family.
    <br>We want to encourage the whole family.
    <br>As Joshua said, that as for him and his family, they will serve the Lord.
    <br>So, we want to encourage you and your family to go and serve the Lord in Spirit and in truth,
    <br>and we pray that God Almighty will grant you the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
