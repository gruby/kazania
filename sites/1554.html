    <br>As a man of faith, when everything seems discouraging, you can still press on.
    <br>See my hand!
    <br>As a man of faith, when everything seems discouraging...
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>You look here - no way, here - no way...
    <br>Nobody wants to listen to you, everything is closed, oh Lord.
    <br>When everything suggests that there is no way, no hope, no friend, no...
    <br>As a man of faith, you can still press on.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>As a Christian, each embarrassment we receive would draw us closer to Jesus.
    <br>Each insult we receive would draw us closer to Jesus.
    <br>Each persecution should draw us closer to Jesus.
    <br>When you have faith in God, you would only
    <br>discuss about the One who is fighting for you instead of the battle.
    <br>When you have faith in God, you would only
    <br>discuss about the promise of victory instead of the warfare.
    <br>As a man of faith, when everything seems discouraging,
    <br>as a man of faith, when everything suggests that there is no hope,
    <br>there is no way, there is no breakthrough,
    <br>you can still press on!

    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>- If God is with us...
    <br>- [... who can be against us.]
    <br>- If God is with a nation...
    <br>- [... who can be against her.]
    <br>I greet you, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I pray the Lord will bless you in a special way, as we go into the message today.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God is calling you to change".
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[God is calling you to change.]
    <br>Get ready; your thinking will change.
    <br>Your attitude will change.
    <br>Everything that has to do with you will change today!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Everything that has to do with me will change.
    <br>My attitude will change.
    <br>My thinking will change".
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>One thing I want you to know about the New Testament, which we shall take our message from,
    <br>is that the New Testament was written originally in common, not classical Greek,
    <br>so that common people could understand its important message.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>Let the people of God rejoice for the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church.
    <br>Let me see your joy.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Rejoice, for the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church".
    <br>Let me see your excitement!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Like I was saying,
    <br>the New Testament was written originally in common, not classical Greek,
    <br>so that people like me...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "People like you could understand its important message".
    <br>Let me see your Bible.
    <br>Raise it and wave it.
    <br>Read it because it has converting power!
    <br>Read it; it has purifying power!
    <br>Read it because it has healing power!
    <br>Read it because it is enduring!
    <br>Read it because it is food for your soul!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Read it because is is a guidance for your feet!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You must read it because it keeps you from error and sin.
    <br>It is so profitable!
    <br>It rejoices the heart.
    <br>It is your spiritual weapon.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Let someone say, "I am to change!
    <br>My attitude is to change!"
    <br>I cannot hear you; stand up and tell your neighbour!
    <br>I am to change!
    <br>My attitude is to change!
    <br>My way and cause are to change!
    <br>Somebody came here for a change.
    <br>Let me see.
    <br>If you are here for a change, let me see your excitement.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>I tell you - you will never remain the same.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Say, "I will never remain the same!
    <br>I am here to change!
    <br>My attitude is to change!
    <br>My philosophy is to change!
    <br>My way of life is to change!
    <br>My spiritual life - to change!
    <br>Hallelujah - I'm here to change!
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Yes, I am to change.
    <br>My attitude is to change.
    <br>My way of looking at things is to change.
    <br>I'm here to change!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Before we go to the lesson today,
    <br>one thing is clear:
    <br>Jesus always wants us to show our genuine willingness to receive.
    <br>In similar encounters between Jesus and those He healed,
    <br>in similar encounters between Jesus and those He blessed,
    <br>in similar encounters between Jesus and those He delivered,
    <br>He often asked them probing questions.
    <br>For example:
    <br>When He met blind Bartimaeus,
    <br>He did not just offer to heal him.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's look at what happened in that Mark 10:51.
    <br>Listen to the question - He asked him:
    <br>"What do you want me to do for you?"
    <br>When He met him, He didn't just offer to heal him.
    <br>He asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?"
    <br>And it was obvious that the man needed help!
    <br>Someone who was saying, "Son of David, have mercy on me" -
    <br>it was very clear that the man needed help.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>When He met the man at the pool of Bethesda,
    <br>He did not just offer to heal him.
    <br>He asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
    <br>And it was obvious that the man needed help.
    <br>When you look at the Book of John 5:6,
    <br>"Do you want to get well?"
    <br>And it was obvious that the man needed help.
    <br>When Jesus met him, He did not just offer to heal him.
    <br>Rather He chose to probe into his state of mind.
    <br>To Jesus, what is important is the ability to register one's willingness to receive.
    <br>Not, "Please, help me! Please, do this!"
    <br>What is important to Jesus is the ability to register one's willingness to receive.
    <br>Whichever way you show your willingness,
    <br>whether you cry like blind Bartimaeus, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
    <br>or you pray silently like Hannah in Shiloh,
    <br>one thing is clear: If your action is genuine, the Holy Spirit affects it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Whether you cry like blind Bartimaeus,
    <br>or pray silently like Hannah in Shiloh,
    <br>one thing is clear: If your action is genuine, the Holy Spirit affects it".
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Are you ready to go with me?
    <br>Let us go.
    <br>Our Bible reading shall be taken from the Book of Matthew 15.
    <br>This will take us to the message titled:
    <br>Slowly But Surely
    <br>Part 4
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Look here.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>But what?
    <br>[Surely]
    <br>It is all about a woman from Canaan.
    <br>She had an encounter with Jesus Christ.
    <br>She was full of faith, patience,
    <br>forbearance and perseverance of the saints.
    <br>Our Bible reading shall be taken from the Book of Matthew 15.
    <br>I will take my reading from verse 21.
    <br>"Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
    <br>A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to Him, crying out,
    <br>'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me!
    <br>My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession.'
    <br>Jesus did not answer a word.
    <br>So His disciples came to Him and urged Him,
    <br>'Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.'
    <br>He answered, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.' "
    <br>Wow!
    <br>This is a statement of purpose, "I'm sent to the Jews, not to the Gentiles".
    <br>Verse 25:
    <br>"The woman came and knelt before Him. 'Lord, help me!' she said.
    <br>He replied, 'It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs'.
    <br>'Yes, Lord,' she said,
    <br>'but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.'
    <br>Then Jesus answered, 'Woman, you have great faith!
    <br>Your request is granted.' And her daughter was healed from that very hour."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I like that.
    <br>Her petition was, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
    <br>She did not limit Jesus but simply pleaded for mercy.
    <br>Are you here to plead for mercy?
    <br>I know you are here to complain.
    <br>"I have headache, I have tension and pressure.
    <br>Failure in business, failure in career, failure in marriage..."
    <br>I know that is why you are here.
    <br>But this woman did not...
    <br>She simply pleaded for mercy, knowing how undeserving she was.
    <br>If we know how undeserving we are,
    <br>we would not come to His presence and begin to ask for healing,
    <br>we would not come to His presence and begin to ask for blessing,
    <br>we would not come to His presence and begin to ask for deliverance.
    <br>When we know how undeserving we are,
    <br>we will come to His presence and give Him thanks for His mercy and grace.
    <br>She did not limit Jesus; she simply pleaded for mercy.
    <br>If we know how undeserving we are,
    <br>we would not come to His presence and begin to ask for healing,
    <br>begin to ask for blessing,
    <br>and begin to ask for deliverance.
    <br>When we know how undeserving we are,
    <br>we will come to His presence and give Him thanks
    <br>for His mercy and kindness over us.
    <br>The woman knew how undeserving she was.
    <br>That was why she did not limit Jesus' response to that particular need.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Remember, her daughter was in need of deliverance from the demons that tormented her.
    <br>The woman did not limit Jesus' response to that particular need.
    <br>She chose the paths of faith and humility.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means, her faith was evident in her appeal.
    <br>You know, you begin to say, "Please, please..."
    <br>She did not say, "Please" because she saw others saying, "Please".
    <br>She did not say, "Heal me" because she saw others saying, "Heal me".
    <br>She said, "Please, heal me" because the Spirit of God inspired her to say that.
    <br>The Bible says, no one can say, "Jesus is the Lord"
    <br>except he is guided, controlled, commanded, taught by the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That does not mean people will not say, "Heal me".
    <br>The Bible is referring to the genuineness of it.
    <br>When you are controlled emotionally, you would lose the sense of objectivity.
    <br>Jesus' objectivity was founded on commitment and genuineness of faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Jesus' objectivity was founded on commitment and genuineness of faith".
    <br>The woman cried.
    <br>The woman's faith was further evident in her persistence.
    <br>She kept rolling, "Son of David, have mercy on me".
    <br>Nothing could discourage her.
    <br>Her knowledge that Jesus was a Jewish Messiah did not discourage her.
    <br>Any other person would have been discouraged by the racial differences.
    <br>I mean, the racial discrimination between Jews and Gentiles.
    <br>Jesus' initial silence did not discourage her.
    <br>The Bible says, Jesus did not say a word to her.
    <br>The disciples' efforts to get rid of her did not discourage her.
    <br>Listen to this.
    <br>"He answered, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.' "
    <br>This is Jesus' statement of purpose,
    <br>"This is My purpose. This is why I'm here".
    <br>Look: I'm here to give people of South Africa banana.
    <br>So, anybody that is not from South Africa should leave.
    <br>That is a statement of purpose.
    <br>I'm here to give people from South Korea a biscuit.
    <br>Anybody that is not from South Korea should...
    <br>I'm here to give people of Nigeria pounded yam, ogbono.
    <br>Anyone that is not from Nigeria should...
    <br>This is a statement of purpose:
    <br>"I am sent to the Jews, not Gentiles."
    <br>The woman was not discouraged.
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Verse 24; please, repeat after me:
    <br>"He answered, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.' "
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>And the woman was from Canaan.
    <br>For me now to say, "I'm sent to South Africa people -
    <br>you from South Korea, what are you doing again? You have no business again. Find your way!"
    <br>For me now to say, "I'm sent to Korea people -
    <br>what are you doing, South Africans? Go!"
    <br>This is a statement of purpose:
    <br>"I am sent to the Jews, not Gentiles."
    <br>These are racial differences between Jews and Gentiles, racial discrimination.
    <br>The woman was not discouraged.
    <br>She acknowledged Jesus' Messianic status and His ability to meet her need.
    <br>Jesus knew that His encounter with this woman from Canaan was a strategic one
    <br>because it was an opportunity for Jesus
    <br>to demonstrate that His ministry was for both Jews and Gentiles.
    <br>Big opportunity - we call it, "Strategic One".
    <br>Even then, He would not give Himself out so cheaply;
    <br>I know, my Lord, He would not give Himself out so cheaply;
    <br>He needed to test her commitment and genuineness.
    <br>Remember, it takes a man of faith to recognise another man of faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[It takes a man of faith to recognise another man of faith.]
    <br>It takes a man of faith to recognise a man of faith.
    <br>Jesus saw in her a genuine, a true, a committed servant,
    <br>a willing servant, a true disciple and honoured her request.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>The only way you can honour Jesus is to have faith in Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The only way you can honour Jesus is to have faith in Him".
    <br>Of all graces, faith honours Jesus most;
    <br>therefore, of all graces, Christ honours faith most.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Of all graces, faith honours Jesus most;
    <br>therefore, of all graces, Christ honours faith most".
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>There is nothing you can give Jesus without faith.
    <br>Your crying and complaints cannot force Jesus to become sentimental.
    <br>When you are controlled emotionally, you lose sense of objectivity.
    <br>Jesus' objectivity was founded on commitment and genuineness of faith.
    <br>"Because you have been a Christian, born to a Christian home, your father is a Reverend,
    <br>your father is a pastor, I'm a bishop, I'm this, that..." - no!
    <br>Your crying and complaints cannot force Jesus to become sentimental.
    <br>Jesus' objectivity was founded on commitment and genuineness of faith.
    <br>The only way you can honour Jesus is to have faith in Him.
    <br>Of all graces, faith honours Jesus most;
    <br>of all graces, Christ honours faith most.
    <br>When you have faith in Christ,
    <br>each embarrassment you receive would draw you closer to Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When I have faith in Christ,
    <br>each embarrassment I receive would draw me closer to Jesus".
    <br>When I have faith in Christ,
    <br>each insult I receive would draw me closer to Jesus.
    <br>When I have faith in Christ,
    <br>each persecution I receive would draw me closer to Jesus.
    <br>When I have faith in Christ,
    <br>each trial, hard time, poverty I receive would draw me closer to Jesus.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>You know what happened to the woman.
    <br>Each embarrassment she received drew her closer to Jesus.
    <br>This means,
    <br>the closer she got to Jesus, the more her breakthrough was being built up
    <br>slowly but surely.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Draw me nearer
    <br>Nearer blessed Lord
    <br>To the cross where Thou hast died
    <br>Draw me nearer
    <br>Nearer blessed Lord
    <br>To the cross where Thou hast died
    <br>Draw me nearer
    <br>Nearer blessed Lord

    <br>Saviour
    <br>Hear my humble cry
    <br>While on others Thou art calling
    <br>Do not pass me by
    <br>Listen to Paul Apostle in 2 Corinthians 12.
    <br>I'm going to take my reading from verse 10:
    <br>"That is why, for Christ's sake,
    <br>I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties.
    <br>For when I am weak, then I am strong."
    <br>As a Christian, each embarrassment we receive would draw us closer to Jesus.
    <br>Each insult we receive would draw us closer to Jesus.
    <br>Each persecution should draw us closer to Jesus.
    <br>When you have faith in God, you would only discuss
    <br>about the One who is fighting for you instead of the battle.
    <br>When you have faith in God, you would only discuss
    <br>about the promise of victory instead of the warfare.
    <br>You would only discuss the promises of the Father, the promises of victory.
    <br>What are the promises of victory?
    <br>I am blessed - Jesus is mine.
    <br>I am healed - Jesus is my Healer.
    <br>I am redeemed - Jesus is my Redeemer.
    <br>I am saved - Jesus is my Saviour.
    <br>You will only discuss about the promises of victory instead of warfare.
    <br>Each embarrassment we receive as Christians would draw us closer.
    <br>This is what Paul said,
    <br>"For Christ's sake, I delight in insult, persecution, difficulties.
    <br>For when I'm weak, then I'm strong".
    <br>Persecutions should be our tonic, to our anointing.
    <br>Difficulties should be our tonic, to our anointing.
    <br>During the period of this encounter,
    <br>the closer she got to Jesus,
    <br>the more her breakthrough was being built up slowly but surely.
    <br>Each embarrassment we receive as Christians would draw us closer to Jesus,
    <br>knowing that the closer we get to Jesus,
    <br>the more our breakthrough is being built up slowly but surely.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"The closer I get to Jesus, the more my breakthrough
    <br>is being built up slowly but surely".
    <br>Rise up and tell your neighbour!
    <br>The closer I get to Jesus, the more my breakthrough
    <br>is being built up slowly but surely.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>You need to understand this message.
    <br>The woman was saying, "Son of David, have mercy on me".
    <br>During the period of this encounter, the closer she got to Jesus,
    <br>the more her breakthrough was being built up slowly.

    <br>As a man of faith, when everything seems discouraging, you can still press on.
    <br>See my hand.
    <br>As a man of faith, when everything seems discouraging...
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>You look here - no way, here - no way.

    <br>As a man of faith, you can still press on.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>This was exactly what happened to the woman.
    <br>When she moved, "Son of David", she was ignored.
    <br>Jesus was initially silent.
    <br>"Son of David, have mercy on me!"
    <br>"I am sent to the Jews, not Gentiles."
    <br>The disciples said, "Shut up! Go!"

    <br>night - nightmare,
    <br>husband and wife - disagreement,
    <br>friends - hatred.

    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>When you have faith in Jesus, you would only discuss
    <br>about the One who is fighting for you instead of the battle.
    <br>When you have faith in Jesus,
    <br>each embarrassment you receive would draw you closer to Jesus.
    <br>Jesus loves those who are able to exercise great faith under great trials and temptations.
    <br>The woman exercised great faith in the face of great trials and temptation.
    <br>Stand up and tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Jesus loves those who are able to exercise great faith
    <br>under great trials and temptations".
    <br>When you endure trials and hardship for what you believe,
    <br>God deals with you as a son.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you endure hardship and trials for what you believe,
    <br>God deals with you as a son".
    <br>She endured; she exercised great faith in the face of great trials and temptation
    <br>and Jesus dealt with her as a son.
    <br>Jesus gave her the right of sonship.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Now, I want you to lift up your voice and ask Jesus,
    <br>"Give me the grace to further my cause".
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>When everything around me seems discouraging,
    <br>give me the grace to further my cause.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>In that Matthew 15:
    <br>"Then Jesus answered, 'Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.' "
    <br>This means, whatever attitude Jesus seemed to put before the woman
    <br>was just a mere test of faith.
    <br>Jesus was just wearing a frown on His face but tenderness and love in His heart.

    <br>During the period of this encounter,
    <br>each embarrassment she received drew her closer to Jesus.
    <br>Each insult she received drew her closer to Jesus.
    <br>Each persecution, difficulty she received drew her closer to Jesus.
    <br>The closer she got to Jesus,
    <br>the more her breakthrough was being built up slowly but surely.

    <br>When you have faith in Jesus, each embarrassment you receive,
    <br>each insult you receive,
    <br>each difficulty you receive,
    <br>each persecution you receive would draw you closer to Jesus.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>The closer you get to Jesus,
    <br>the more your breakthrough is being built up slowly but surely.
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Stand up and tell your neighbour,
    <br>"The closer I am to Jesus as a Christian
    <br>the more my breakthrough is being built up slowly but surely".
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>The woman was able to exercise great faith under great trials and temptations.
    <br>When the answers to our prayer are held back,
    <br>it is an opportunity for us to pray the more,
    <br>to be more fervent in our prayer,
    <br>fast the more, be more devoted.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When the answers to your prayer are held back,
    <br>it is an opportunity for you to pray the more,
    <br>fast the more, be more devoted".
    <br>Is This TB Joshua's MOST CHARISMATIC Sermon?!? ðŸ”¥
    <br>Jesus loves those who exercise great faith under great trials and temptation.
    <br>Finally,
    <br>the case of the Canaanite woman clearly expresses
    <br>the principle of life that says,
    <br>the business, the journey,
    <br>the victory, is not for those who quit but those who endure.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"The victory is not for those who quit but those who endure".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>What happened to the Canaanite woman showed that
    <br>Jesus' response is not for those in hurry.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Jesus' response is not for those in hurry".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>If your prayer is turned down, don't give up.
    <br>When everything around you seems discouraging, don't give up.
    <br>When everything around you suggests that there is no future, there is no hope,
    <br>don't give up.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When everything around you suggests that there is no hope,
    <br>there is no future, don't give up!"
    <br>Everything around her suggested that there was no hope, there was no future,
    <br>but the Bible said, she kept pressing, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
    <br>Thank you.
