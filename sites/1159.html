    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>God lives here.
    <br>I said God lives in the Synagogue.
    <br>My name is Mr Ume Chinedu Ambi.
    <br>The lovely lady with me is my lovely daughter, Elizabeth Numao Ume. She is a half Japanese.
    <br>Although we are from Japan, originally we are Nigerians living in Japan.
    <br>Our testimony goes like this:
    <br>We are here to disgrace the devil. We have a lot but let us start with the...
    <br>I mean how God delivered us from this generational curse, which is asthma.
    <br>I mean, it's precisely four years ago now, 2014 when we came here.
    <br>I came here with my daughter.
    <br>Before I say that, I think I have one confession to make.
    <br>And that confession is this: Each time our mentor, my mentor and your mentor,
    <br>Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua says that word, it always hits my heart.
    <br>He always says you are welcome.
    <br>"Over my dead body" - I think I was one of the people who was against this ministry.
    <br>Let me be sincere.
    <br>In fact, to the extent that I wouldn't even want somebody close to me
    <br>to mention T.B. Joshua or The Synagogue where I am.
    <br>I remember one time in Japan when I was... they were about to do a container for me
    <br>and there were about 3 or 4 guys and one of them just mentioned T. B. Joshua.
    <br>In fact I just called the owner of the place and said, "Please, can you just suspend this guy.
    <br>I don't want him to touch my stuffs".
    <br>To show you the extent I was against that...
    <br>Let me be sincere to tell the truth; I want to shame the devil.
    <br>I never believed that, the same man, the same place...
    <br>In fact people who are hearing me now because a lot of people know me in Japan -
    <br>I was the vice chairman of the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce
    <br>and I have a company MBG Global  Company Japan Ltd.
    <br>I have almost 27 people working for me there.
    <br>But everybody, in fact I know most of them watching me now will say, "Hey, finally".
    <br>Each time now, as I'm talking to you here now,  Emmanuel TV is on in Japan at my workplace.
    <br>I never play with it ever since  I discovered this ministry.
    <br>The man I hated so much, I talked so much about him, against him.
    <br>Then what brought me here?
    <br>People of God, it's a long story but I have to make it short.
    <br>After the death of my mother; in fact that was 2007; I had burial rites for her in 2008.
    <br>Like I was talking about asthma, my mother died of the same sickness.
    <br>Right in my compound - it's a small compound in my village - here I buried my father,
    <br>immediate junior brother and the next my mother.
    <br>I never believed because in Japan I never believed anything, evil attacks.
    <br>Instead I told them, "Look, it's only in Nigeria you see people talking about spiritual attacks and the rest of it".
    <br>But people of God it was like:
    <br>After the death of my mother, I started experiencing spiritual attacks.
    <br>This attack was so enormous that they brought a coffin
    <br>and in that coffin, in fact each time I slept, they brought a coffin for me.
    <br>They said, "Look, you are the next person". They showed it on my compound.
    <br>They said, "Look, the fourth one is you". So I asked, "What is happening?
    <br>I ate in the dream, flew in the dream, spiritual wife.
    <br>To the extent that it was only my little daughter that was with me. Everybody left me.
    <br>My company, all the three shops, everything closed down.
    <br>There was nothing. What is happening?
    <br>In fact, the second time, the third time, my spirit left my body.
    <br>Let me just call this church because I cannot even...
    <br>Look, I am a dead person but I think I am alive because of this ministry.
    <br>Through this ministry...
    <br>Mr Chinedu & Daughter
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Through this ministry, God decided to give me a second chance to live again.
    <br>In fact when it was too much, the whole thing was too much, I couldn't...
    <br>The one thing that I couldn't believe was that I locked up all the doors.
    <br>How then did somebody, an old woman come into - this was not even in the dream.
    <br>It was live. An old woman came to my bed and slept on my bed,
    <br>I was like, "What is happening, after I prayed and everything?"
    <br>So when it was too much, I said, "Look, one thing I said I will not do
    <br>is to go and start to go to babalawo (witch doctor) but I have done everything humanly possible".
    <br>They took me to a spiritualist, they prayed for me. It didn't work, nothing worked.
    <br>Then I called my little brother who lives in Japan with me.
    <br>I told him, "Look, what I did was to write my will".
    <br>First, they said, "It's because you have not married. You need to get married".
    <br>I went to Nigeria, I got married three times but to no avail. All of them left.
    <br>Spirit of rejection, everything I touched. Everything, all my projects, everything stopped.
    <br>All my containers - I had three containers that were coming - everything seized, nothing.
    <br>I mean, this is not a contraband.
    <br>As I am talking to you, up to today, these containers are nowhere to be found.
    <br>What I did was I called my little brother. He came and I wrote my will.
    <br>I gave my will to my daughter.
    <br>I brought out my credit cards, all my passports and gave them to her.
    <br>I said, "I might leave anytime; any moment from now, I will go and join my ancestors".
    <br>Because there was no hope, no more hope. I had lost all hope.
    <br>So my little brother looked at me and I was crying, shedding tears right in my office.
    <br>He said, "Brother, let's go to your house". I said, "Why?" He said, "Let's go to your house".
    <br>When we got to my house, then he brought out... he just dipped inside his pocket.
    <br>Mr Chinedu & Daughter
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>He brought out this. I said, "What is this?"
    <br>He said, "Brother, do you remember what you told me during December time
    <br>when I wanted to travel to the village?" - I had asked him not to go to village.
    <br>They needed somebody; they wanted to bury another person again.
    <br>He said, "Do you know what I did?" - I said, "What? Did you go to babalawo (witch doctor)?
    <br>I told you not to. You know me, I don't believe in all these babalawos (witch doctors)".
    <br>He said, "No, I got something that is bigger than babalawo (witch doctor)".
    <br>I said, "What is that?" He said, "This is it".
    <br>Mr Chinedu & Daughter
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So he said, "Brother, let us pray", and I closed my eyes.
    <br>You know, somebody who is about to die, you are now ready to accept anything.
    <br>Then we started praying.
    <br>Then he said, "Open your mouth"; I opened my mouth.
    <br>He just sprayed it two times.
    <br>Then he went around the whole house and sprayed the Morning Water.
    <br>After that he left.
    <br>Believe me, people of God, that very day, it was like the whole house was calm.
    <br>Mr Chinedu & Daughter
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>All those noises - because from the other room I would hear noise, the other place,,,
    <br>The cats that used to cry every night beside my window - I never knew that cats cry like a baby -
    <br>everything subsided.
    <br>I said, "God, what is this. Can it be magic?"
    <br>Then I called him the next day.
    <br>I said, "Come. Bring that something for me".
    <br>Mr Chinedu & Daughter
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Because then, I never knew. I said, "Bring that magic for me again".
    <br>He said, "Brother, sorry". Now he came back. He brought it and said, "This is Morning Water".
    <br>I said nothing. He filled it with water and said, "Brother, have this one; start spraying it".
    <br>Believe me, when I sprayed it, I didn't hear anything again.
    <br>The next day I just went to YouTube and it said "Synagogue" and he came out.
    <br>I said, "This is the man that I hated so much. Can this be real?"
    <br>So what I did was...
    <br>A period before then, I had been operated two times of kidney cancer.
    <br>I then went to the hospital the next day.
    <br>When I got to the hospital - because after the operation, I kept on going to follow up -
    <br>the next thing after the test, the doctor said, "Look, it's confirmed, you are free from cancer".
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I asked him, "Can I travel to Nigeria?" and he said, "Yes".
    <br>After the operation he had said I could not travel because of this.
    <br>So he now said, "You can travel".
    <br>I took the next available flight to Nigeria; I flew straight to The SCOAN.
    <br>But a significant thing happened that very day; there was one beautiful thing that happened.
    <br>Because that very day - that was in June, the man of God's birthday.
    <br>Everywhere was highly jam-packed; there was no space.
    <br>In fact, there was no space for me.
    <br>I was surprised; I was thinking it was just things you give out - you get easy access.
    <br>Right down at the overflow side, I sat down because there were too many people.
    <br>I sat down. All of a sudden, I was in a trance. Then I bent down my head.
    <br>The next thing I saw was - I saw Jesus standing in my front.
    <br>And there was an altar. The altar was in my front and Jesus was there.
    <br>Then I woke up and said, "Am I sleeping? Am I dreaming?"
    <br>Then the second time it happened, I stood up.
    <br>I walked round the whole compound and said, "God, what is going on?"
    <br>The next day, which was a Sunday, I was opportune to get into the church.
    <br>Then I discovered that it was exactly the same altar where I was kneeling down -
    <br>the same altar where I was kneeling down that very day.
    <br>I said, "God". Then I called my brother and said, "God is here".
    <br>I never knew that asthma... - I was told that asthma can never be cured because it is in the blood.
    <br>That was when I was told that asthma can be cured.
    <br>I just dashed out to go and bring my daughter.
    <br>In fact, people of God, after that...
    <br>Ok, tell us - what was the problem your daughter was having then
    <br>and what were the challenges she was facing?
    <br>In fact, the same asthma that took away my mother's life
    <br>was about to take even my own life and her own life too.
    <br>Her own was so severe that every month, we were in the hospital.
    <br>People who knew her in Ibadan, one of the American schools, ACA American Christian Academy,
    <br>they knew her very much at UCH because every month, she used to be in UCH -
    <br>they used to admit her at the University Teaching Hospital in Ibadan.
    <br>It was too much then - I spent money, I spent everything but to no avail.
    <br>There was a drug they said it was a drug from India. I ordered it.
    <br>We used it for almost 90 days with no oil, nothing but it was to no avail.
    <br>Then in Japan, there is one they call kampo yaku - that is in Japanese language - a traditional drug.
    <br>We used it to no avail.
    <br>I want her to talk for herself.
    <br>At the end of the day, I spent money, I spent everything but I tell you, people of God,
    <br>when we came down - no money, nothing.
    <br>We didn't pay a dime; it was just only the touch of the man of God.
    <br>Then, we continued to administer the Morning Water.
    <br>Before I knew it, up to today, my brethren, it is four years now; we have not been to any hospital again.
    <br>I want to tell people that Prophet T.B. Joshua...
    <br>I say it in Yoruba - agbanilagbatan - it is God that heals; when He heals, He heals completely.
    <br>I want to tell people that there is God.
    <br>If you are watching me here, just keep on - look to this altar, He is here.
    <br>Jesus is here. He lives here.
    <br>I said God lives in this Synagogue and everybody that knows me now knows that.
    <br>I said God of T.B. Joshua doesn't have peer.
    <br>I have travelled all over the world; I have travelled almost all continents.
    <br>As I am talking to you presently, if there is anywhere else you can tell me there is God,
    <br>please come and show me.
    <br>I was in Japan, I only just touched Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I mean, can you imagine - I can't fathom that.
    <br>How can you believe? How can you believe that only touching in Japan - as far as Japan?
    <br>I touched Emmanuel TV - in fact, I was shocked, "What is happening?"
    <br>So there is no any other God.
    <br>To God be the Glory. Put your hands together beautifully for the Miracle Worker Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Elizabeth Ume. I am 17 years old and I am from Japan.
    <br>My problem goes like: I had asthma since when I was born.
    <br>I had a very severe asthma.
    <br>I was admitted into hospital almost every single month and I couldn't do a lot of things.
    <br>I couldn't do a lot of sports, activities and play around with my friends because of the asthma.
    <br>Sometimes, it was very difficult to have my education
    <br>because I was pulled out from school because of my severe asthma.
    <br>There was this time - it was very difficult for me to breathe in and breathe out.
    <br>So it was basically disabling me from a lot of things.
    <br>My dad took me to The SCOAN and it was my first time here.
    <br>I didn't know what was going on but I was just excited to be here because I love Africa so much.
    <br>When I came here, the man of God touched me and I fell down.
    <br>I didn't remember what was going on but I just fell down and then I woke up.
    <br>From that time, I was breathing just fine.
    <br>I was breathing totally fine.
    <br>Healed Of Asthma
    <br>Through The New Morning Water
    <br>I went back to Japan and since then, I have not been to the hospital.
    <br>I have not been admitted to the hospital again - not even once, not in my life.
    <br>I keep on administering this Morning Water.
    <br>From then, I have been so healthy; I haven't been having any asthma;
    <br>I haven't been having any difficulty in breathing.
    <br>Thank you to the Lord.
    <br>Wow. Put your hands together for what the Lord has done in the life of our sister.
    <br>My advice is that there are a lot of people in the world who don't know The SCOAN
    <br>and people don't really know God exists.
    <br>I just want to advise people that people should get to know God
    <br>and spread the Word of God so everybody in the world can know this.
    <br>Anybody that has asthma: I pray that they will come here to get healed.
    <br>Healed Of Asthma
    <br>Through The New Morning Water
    <br>My advice goes like this: I want to borrow a word from the Yoruba language -
    <br>and I will interpret it to you.
    <br>The meaning is this: Come and test and see that the Lord is good.
    <br>Those who are doubting - like those doubting Thomases like me before -
    <br>those who don't believe in The Synagogue;
    <br>those who don't believe there is God in Nigeria because some of us believe nothing could come...
    <br>Come and test. I am advising you to come. Just come.
    <br>Don't let anybody deceive you.
    <br>And those words - sometimes, you hear people saying all sort of things.
    <br>In fact it happened to me. "You know operations work" - people will tell you something.
    <br>But my brethren, I am a living witness; I am a living testimony. God is here.
    <br>There are other people I knew that I kept in contact with that knew something is happening here.
    <br>They knew but I see them as being jealous.
    <br>They are being jealous of what is happening - that God is using the man of God T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Or perhaps they are pastors, they have their own churches.
    <br>But I want to tell them that because the Bible is our standard
    <br>and God said, I will forgive every sin that a man committed but one.
    <br>And which sin is that? Sin against the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Because you know quite alright that the Holy Spirit is using the man of God; the Holy Spirit is here.
    <br>And you are now saying something evil.
    <br>You can even imagine that when somebody was healed here and he was called -
    <br>somebody called him from his church and said, "Leave that place".
    <br>Somebody who was healed.
    <br>So I want to tell you that please, the Bible is our standard.
    <br>I say, please, can you just desist from that; stop that
    <br>because God is not going to forgive you because that is sin against the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Mr Chinedu & Daughter
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The Morning Water is God Himself.
    <br>I used to tell people, "Look, I cannot do anything without the Morning Water - not even my food..."
    <br>No matter where I am going, anything I do...
    <br>I used to tell her, "This Morning Water, don't just...".
    <br>People of God, please, when you have it, make an altar for it and keep it there.
    <br>That's how I keep it - I have my altar where I keep my Morning Water; it's precious.
    <br>And God is here and God is still using the man of God.
    <br>God is using this man to heal the world.
    <br>We thank you very much for your wonderful advice and we also want to enjoin you that
    <br>as God Almighty has healed you, delivered you and set you free,
    <br>make sure you make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>so that that healing you and your daughter have received will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
