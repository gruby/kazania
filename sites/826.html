    <br>Children of God, Emmanuel! (God with us  -  Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Corporal Yerimah Peter Ojoh.
    <br>I am from Edo State by birth. I reside here in Lagos.
    <br>I serve as a soldier in the Nigerian army.
    <br>Praise God.
    <br>The testimony that I have to share with you this morning
    <br>is a testimony about a liver infection.
    <br>Many people believe that a liver infection has no cure.
    <br>But Jesus has the cure.
    <br>Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.
    <br>It all happened in 2012 when my wife gave birth.
    <br>I was away on a mission in Darfur when my wife gave birth to my first son.
    <br>After giving birth, from the second day, unusual things started happening in my life.
    <br>My body changed - I could not walk, breath and even see well.
    <br>These are the things that started happening in my life.
    <br>I couldn't share this with anybody.
    <br>I was just lying in the hostel.
    <br>I was encouraged to visit the hospital for a medical check-up.
    <br>I could not go by myself, the M.R.S. on the mission assisted me.
    <br>The doctors could not detect the cause and referred me to our Level 1 hospital in Nyala,
    <br>which is the transit camp for all military staff in Darfur.
    <br>They carried out some medical examinations and could not detect what it was and referred me again,
    <br>to Pakistan Military Hospital, which is at Level 3.
    <br>I couldn't walk so I was assisted to reach there.
    <br>It was there where they carried out some medical tests about my life.
    <br>What you are seeing here are not school certificates but certificates of life.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Please, can you help me.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>The first one on the board indicates all the blood functions,
    <br>and they discovered that there was no problem.
    <br>They conducted a test on the liver. I didn't know then that I had a liver problem.
    <br>They detected that I had a liver infection.
    <br>It had risen from a normal number up to 80. If it had went up from 80 to 90, that would have been fatal.
    <br>The doctor's report confirmed that I could not walk, had severe headaches, pains, dizziness and could not stand.
    <br>They had to refer me to a place where they could refer me back to my country.
    <br>I and another soldier had that problem.
    <br>We were told that by Monday, the two of us would be referred to Nigeria.
    <br>That there was no cure for this kind of sickness.
    <br>On Sunday, my colleague who is now retired -
    <br>I believe wherever he is now he is watching Emmanuel TV because he is an Emmanuel TV partner -
    <br>he said they should bring me to the screen
    <br>because he had a laptop in the hostel on which he was watching the LIVE service.
    <br>He said they should call me and assist me to be there
    <br>as the Man of God was about to pray for the whole nation.
    <br>He wanted me to join them and lay my hand on the screen as he knew that something would happen.
    <br>The Man of God began praying. He said, "Wherever you are now, touch the screen, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Connect your faith with mine. Whatever problem you have, Jesus knows about it".
    <br>Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.
    <br>I touched the screen and he then mentioned my problem.
    <br>He said, "I speak to your liver, bones and kidneys.
    <br>Whatsoever pain you have, I command the pain out!"
    <br>I said "Amen". They assisted me to touch the screen, then after the prayer they assisted me back to my bed.
    <br>During the night, something happened.
    <br>I was sleeping. Then, I heard a voice, an echoing voice saying, "My son, stand up!"
    <br>I woke up from my body, part of me was still lying down. I rose up and looked at myself.
    <br>I said, "Ah, what kind of magic is this?" because I was still seeing part of myself lying down.
    <br>He said, "I created you without a problem. Those bodies you are seeing here..." -  I was seeing two bodies.
    <br>I was seeing myself lying down on one side and another replica of myself lying down next to that one.
    <br>He said, "One has sickness, and the other has no sickness. Which one do you belong to?"
    <br>I said, "You created me without a problem or sickness, that is where I belong".
    <br>He said, "Ok, lay here. There is no sickness there" and I Iay in the body with no sickness.
    <br>Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I lay there and then woke up.
    <br>There was no pain in my body. I was very strong and agile.
    <br>I looked at all of this and started shouting in the hall.
    <br>All the soldiers came and asked what happened.
    <br>I said, "It's because of that prayer. God has done it!"
    <br>They were celebrating with me.
    <br>The soldier who was also being referred to Nigeria with me left alone.
    <br>That was in 2012, but you can see me here today.
    <br>I'm healthy. People do ask if Emmanuel TV testimonies are magic
    <br>or if Prophet T.B. Joshua truly is a man of God.
    <br>I am here today to let the world know, that "Yes. Indeed, he is a man of God".
    <br>Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>He had never known me before. He had never seen me before.
    <br>If somebody needs proof, see that my report is from Sudan.
    <br>This is a confirmation from the United Nations. It is not from Nigeria.
    <br>When I came back and shared what had happened with my wife,
    <br>she said that even if she had called to find out, I would have told her that there was no problem.
    <br>"Let us go and test because you're telling me it is a deadly disease."
    <br>I said, "It is a deadly disease. I wouldn't be here now".
    <br>She said, "Let us test". Then, I went to the medical hospital in Forty-four.
    <br>The tests were conducted and according to the report, instead of the level 80 where the devil wanted me to die,
    <br>Jesus has given me life and the new level is at 33. Amen.
    <br>The battallion I went with was number 33 and Jesus gave me the same healthy liver number of 33. Amen.
    <br>Which is a normal range?
    <br>That is the normal range. That is how it is supposed to be for a normal human being.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The reason why I have not been able to come here all this while, to share this testimony,
    <br>is because there was a saying then, "Don't watch Emmanuel TV. Don't partner with them.
    <br>You're a pastor so don't mix with them".
    <br>After some time I started seeing senior pastors with Morning Stickers.
    <br>Corporal Yerimah Ojoh. Emmanuel TV testimony.
    <br>I started seeing them with Morning Stickers on their vehicles. Some even have Morning Water.
    <br>I thought to myself that I am not a senior pastor yet, I am just a baby.
    <br>Since I am a baby, let me share this testimony so that the world will know that
    <br>the disease that the devil says nobody can cure, God can cure it.
    <br>God can remove the old part and put in a new one. That was my case.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give all the glory to God for this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Sir, you have said it all. In the light of what Jesus has done for you,
    <br>what is your advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>Emmanuel! My advice to the viewers all over world is:
    <br>Number one is for all the ministers.
    <br>Don't say anthing against yourselves; don't condemn yourselves.
    <br>This race is one that Jesus has called you to, you have to team up together to defeat satan.
    <br>He says something in John 15:15,
    <br>"Henceforth I call you not servants as a servant will not know what a master is doing.
    <br>I call you friends so that the things I do will be made known unto you".
    <br>So why can't we join hands together and support the Man of God and support each other
    <br>so that more miracles can happen every day.
    <br>Secondly, this is for my colleagues - wherever you are, even on the battle field, Jesus is there.
    <br>Always connect yourself with faith. Pray with the Man of God and you will receive your miracle.
    <br>Those on the sickbed, whether you are having the same problem that "that man" was having then
    <br>because he's no longer here now, a new person is here.
    <br>If you're having the same problem that "that man" was having then, connect your faith wherever you are
    <br>with the Man of God today because he will pray for you and you will receive your own miracle
    <br>and God will see you through, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
