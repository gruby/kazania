  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities
    <br>which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together,
    <br>in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen, right now.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are,
    <br>today is God's time
    <br>and God wants you to be delivered today.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, it is written that you will be free today.
    <br>Freedom from sickness.
    <br>I rescue you from that sickness!
    <br>I rescue you from that hardship!
    <br>I rescue you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>You are rescued and I am sent to declare this.
    <br>God rescued you and He sent me as a medium to declare this.
    <br>I declare to you that you are rescued!
    <br>You are rescued!
    <br>YOU ARE RESCUED!
    <br>Pray with T.B. Joshua
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God
    <br>as you send your testimony.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
