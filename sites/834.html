  <p>    
    <br>Brother, how are you?
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>What happened to this building?
    <br>The building just 'hooked up' just like that because of the enemies; my father's people.
    <br>The building just what?
    <br>It 'hooked up' since 2008 after I roofed it.
    <br>Immediately you started that building, everything, including your business, just collapsed.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because we should ask God before making an attempt or step forward to do something.
    <br>Money should not be the one to control our spiritual life; we should allow the Giver of money to control us.
    <br>Sometimes you want to go to the village and do something,
    <br>instead of you to stay still, prepare your life and be strong in the Lord.
    <br>Suddenly, one collapses there.
    <br>So, there is need to ask God in every step that we are taking.
    <br>What about this court case?
    <br>It has gone.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Go and call your wife because I am seeing a baby boy.
    <br>She is not here!
    <br>Dont worry!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! {God With Us - Matthew 1:23}
    <br>I thank God for being here today,
    <br>and I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua, the man of God, the prophet of our time.
    <br>Without the prophecy of the man of God, I don't know where I would have been.
    <br>A nation without a prophet is finished!
    <br>A country without a prophet is finished!
    <br>It happened like this:
    <br>My name is Mr Michael Ugwu and the woman beside me is my lovely wife,
    <br>Mrs Favour Ugwu, and my son Peter Ugwu.
    <br>On the 27th of April 2014, I was sitting in the church and the Man of God was prophesying.
    <br>Luckily for me, he came across me and asked me, "What about that house? What happened?"
    <br>I told him that I went into that project, I got connected.
    <br>Then, temptations were all around me and many problems.
    <br>He also asked me about the court case, it's all about my land.
    <br>I was living outside Nigeria before.
    <br>This land - the people who sold it to me wanted to take it back from me again.
    <br>After that, it was like he wanted to leave me then he asked, "Where is your wife?"
    <br>I told him that my wife was not there.
    <br>I didn't know that as I was here, my wife was in the house watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>That is the only TV station we watch in our house.
    <br>The Man of God said to me, "I am seeing a baby boy".
    <br>I never told the man of God my problem, that we were barren.
    <br>We were barren for six years.
    <br>I met my wife in 2011; since we met as husband and wife, there has been no child.
    <br>We faced the problem of barrenness for six years.
    <br>Luckily for me, on that fateful day, my problem came to an end.
    <br>The Man of God said, "I am seeing a baby boy."
    <br>I held onto that word in faith and I believed that that day my problem was over.
    <br>Could you imagine...
    <br>When I got back to my house, I prayed with my wife with the Morning Water.
    <br>I met with my wife and suddenly my wife became pregnant.
    <br>I couldn't believe it.
    <br>I was like, "It's not me". My wife said, "I am pregnant".
    <br>I said, "No, you are not pregnant".
    <br>Since then, everything has just been (well).
    <br>After nine months, my wife delivered our baby peacefully.
    <br>She was having multiple fibroids, and the doctor said he would operate her.
    <br>My wife said no; rather, she believed in the Morning Water from The SCOAN.
    <br>My wife anointed herself with the Morning Water.
    <br>To my surprise, she delivered this bouncing baby boy.
    <br>This is the baby boy the man of God talked about when he said, "I'm seeing a baby boy".
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Since then, my life has changed.
    <br>Since we had our baby boy, a lot of blessings and doors have opened in my business.
    <br>In the last three weeks, I bought this car.
    <br>I bought this car for them to use, showing appreciation for what God is doing in my family and my life.
    <br>Since then, a lot of doors have opened - contacts.
    <br>I don't know what to say!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Amen. Indeed, a million thanks are not enough!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>In that word of prophecy, the man of God first of all mentioned the issue of a building.
    <br>Can you explain to us - after the prophecy, what has happened concerning that building?
    <br>After receiving the prophecy about my buildings - there were two buildings.
    <br>I had not even roofed the buildings because money to pay for roofers was a problem.
    <br>I had a lot of jobs to do for that project but I could not get them finished.
    <br>After the prophecy, how it happened I don't know, I was able to finish everything.
    <br>I did not come with the picture because I did not know that I would be here today to give this testimony.
    <br>So you mean that the building that the man of God prophesied about
    <br>that everything had stopped, you have now completed it and it is finished.
    <br>It is finished, everything is finished!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Sir, when you saw your wife deliver this baby boy,
    <br>were you not surprised considering that Prophet T.B. Joshua gave you this prophecy
    <br>when your wife was not pregnant and told you the exact gender of the child in her womb that was going to come.
    <br>Were you not shocked when your wife delivered and you saw that it was a baby boy?
    <br>That is why we are here because I am surprised.
    <br>Even though the Man of God did not know my problem,
    <br>he prophesied to me, "I am seeing a baby boy".
    <br>After that prophecy, I was surprised when my wife delivered
    <br>this beautiful baby boy, by my side here.
    <br>I am surprised. I thank God!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>That is the power of the prophetic word. We can all be a witness to this
    <br>that it can only be by the hand of God that can reveal something of this nature.
    <br>The sex of a child that had not at that time even entered the womb of our brother's wife,
    <br>the Man of God prophesied and it came to pass, and we give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>At this point, we want to hear a word from your wife as well.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Favour Ugwu.
    <br>I want to thank God for the prophecy.
    <br>That day, I was at home. When he asked, "Where is your wife?",
    <br>I was in the parlour watching him.
    <br>He asked, "Where is your wife?" He said, "My wife is at home".
    <br>He then said, "I see a baby boy coming".
    <br>I jumped up and started shouting.
    <br>Immediately, I dressed up and started coming here.
    <br>When I reached here, he prayed for us; that was in 2014.
    <br>We continued praying and at the end of the year 2015, I conceived.
    <br>During the pregnancy, I did not bother to go to the hospital for tests or scans.
    <br>I didn't bother to go because I was sure that what the Man of God said was true.
    <br>At the eighth month, I went for a scan. By then, I had finished buying everything.
    <br>People were asking me why I was buying only male things and not female's.
    <br>I told them that I was sure of what I was buying because God had already said it.
    <br>Even the doctor questioned why I did not want to go for the scan, saying that I was stingy.
    <br>I said I was not stingy but the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua had already said it.
    <br>He told my husband, "This is a baby boy coming".
    <br>Before then, I was praying for a baby girl.
    <br>But immediately he said it, I removed my mind from it.
    <br>I was buying clothes for a male child.
    <br>That day, the doctor asked me to go for a scan but I said that I didn't want to.
    <br>At the eighth month, I went for a scan so that I would have a copy of it.
    <br>Before then, the doctor said that I would go for an operation because he saw a fibroid.
    <br>I said, "No, I will not go for an operation".
    <br>He asked why.
    <br>I said that I did not want to go for an operation.
    <br>He said that I should go for an operation that I should sign
    <br>but I said that I would not sign anything.
    <br>The day that I delivered the baby,
    <br>my husband dropped me at the hospital and I told him that he should go.
    <br>I was holding my Morning Water.
    <br>Before he got back, I delivered my baby and also the fibroids finally came out.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean you delivered safely without any operation
    <br>and as the child came out, the fibroid also came out at that moment?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I used the Morning Water all over my body and prayed.
    <br>Before my husband came, I had already delivered the baby successfully.
    <br>They called him on the phone and when he came, he was screaming and shouting.
    <br>He said, "Are you sure he is my boy?" I said, "Yes, he is your son".
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
    <br>Generally, madam: Just tell us - how have your lives changed since that word of prophecy,
    <br>both in terms of finances and the breakthrough that has come.
    <br>What can you testify about the changes that you and your husband have seen ever since then?
    <br>Our lives have really changed because that year, I was able to go for my youth service.
    <br>which was delayed since 2012.
    <br>There have been breakthroughs in our lives and also his business changed.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. Indeed, a million thanks are not enough
    <br>as the evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.
    <br>Now, madam, we can see a couple of documents on the board,
    <br>aside the picture of the car that your husband bought you.
    <br>Can you just show us what these documents are and what they are representing.
    <br>This is the scan showing that I was pregnant at eight months.
    <br>This is 'SY', showing that it is a male child.
    <br>These are the fibroids - the big one and the small one.
    <br>This is when I was pregnant
    <br>This is the car we were able to buy on December 10th.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
    <br>In the light of what Jesus Christ has done for you and your husband,
    <br>what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My advice to the viewers is that they should believe in God.
    <br>The God who blessed me will bless you too, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for  Christ Jesus!
    <br>Sir, finally, your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world.
    <br>My advice to the viewers all over the world is that they should believe in prophecies.
    <br>Believe in whatever the Man of God tells you.
    <br>If I did not have faith in that prophecy, I do not know how it would have turned out.
    <br>My advice to the whole world is to be always faithful in all your endeavours
    <br>and believe in God. He will see you through your predicaments.
    <br>Amen. One more time, let's put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>We also just want to hear a final word from our sister here because we haven't spoken to her yet.
    <br>Sister, can you just introduce yourself to us, tell us who you are to this family
    <br>and just tell us a word that you want to say about their testimony.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Nneka.
    <br>I really thank God for the life of my sister, for what God has done for her.
    <br>I really thank God. I appreciate God because it was not easy.
    <br>Anybody who has not passed through barrenness will not understand the meaning of barrenness.
    <br>There is no peace in the marriage when there is no child
    <br>but God did it for her and I am here to thank God for what He has done for her.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We pray that God will give this family the grace to raise up this child in the ways of the Lord
    <br>so as he grows up, he shall not depart from it and we know that the best is yet to come in Jesus' name.
