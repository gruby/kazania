    386 - How To Be BORN AGAIN With POWER!!! ðŸ”¥| TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Viewers all over the world...
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of Luke 24:49.
    <br>Let's read together.
    <br>"Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you;
    <br>but tarry in the city of Jerusalem
    <br>until you are endowed with power from on high."
    <br>Let someone say, "God's Spirit".
    <br>GOD'S SPIRIT
    <br>Once again, one, two, three, four...
    <br>"Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you;
    <br>but tarry in the city of Jerusalem
    <br>until you are endowed with power from on high."
    <br>Do you listen to that?
    <br>... until you are endowed...
    <br>The challenges before us cannot be withstood without God's Spirit.
    <br>"I am a Christian without God's Spirit" - which kind of Christian is that,
    <br>while the Bible is telling us in verse 49...?
    <br>Look at what the Bible is saying there; it is clear.
    <br>It says, "Behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you; but tarry..."
    <br>'Tarry' means 'stay'.
    <br>"... in the city of Jerusalem until you are endowed..."
    <br>It means we are to be Christians with power.
    <br>"Until you are endowed" - this means you have to be a Christian with power.
    <br>If you are not a Christian with power, you are a religious man.
    <br>There are differences between religious people and Christianity.
    <br>It is better you know where you belong.
    <br>No one can be a Christian without power.
    <br>You have to be a Christian, evangelist, pastor, prophet, born again with power.
    <br>If you have truly been born again, it was the Holy Spirit
    <br>who convicted you of sin and drew you into a relationship with Jesus.
    <br>What the Bible is saying is simple.
    <br>Serving God without depending upon God's Spirit
    <br>is like serving a god you do not know.
    <br>So, you are calling a god you do not know; anything can come.
    <br>You ask for healing - affliction will come.
    <br>You ask for blessing - hardship will come.
    <br>You ask for this - another thing will come, because you are serving a god you do not know.
    <br>If you worship God without God's Spirit,
    <br>you will always hear yourself when you shout, pray, sing.
    <br>Without God's Sprit, it will only refresh your mind but cannot renew your strength.
    <br>God's Word refreshes our mind; God's Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>You know, there are two different things...
    <br>Anybody can sing, worship, pray, fast, just name them to refresh your mind,
    <br>which musicians used to do.
    <br>When you go to clubs, concerts - the musicians.
    <br>When they sing, you will start crying, because emotionally, you will be carried away.
    <br>They say, "What happened?"
    <br>"The song they are singing - it touched me."
    <br>It can only touch you to refresh your mind, but to renew your strength - God's Spirit.
    <br>Can you see? We are in trouble.
    <br>I say we are in trouble.
    <br>How many people are Christians now?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>How many of us are Christians now?
    <br>This is why I say we are in trouble, and we are in a perilous and dangerous time -
    <br>a time anything can happen.
    <br>We are in trouble because of the question how many of us are Christians?
    <br>We are in trouble.
    <br>We are to be Christians with power.
    <br>In that text, when you read from the beginning:
    <br>after Jesus Christ arose from the grave
    <br>and before He ascended to Heaven, He told His disciples,
    <br>"I will send the Holy Spirit as my Father promised but stay in the city..."
    <br>Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, America - stay in the city, anywhere you are.
    <br>It is not when you go to Jerusalem; the word 'Jerusalem' is a Word of God that the Bible refers to.
    <br>"... stay in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power."
    <br>Holy Spirit to give power, not Holy Spirit power; He is to give power.
    <br>Because the misuse of language today...
    <br>He is bigger than power; He gives power.
    <br>"... stay in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from above."
    <br>Jesus knew that His followers could not fulfill the commission He had given them...
    <br>What is the commission?
    <br>To take the Gospel to all nations -
    <br>until they were immersed (clothed) with power that the Holy Spirit would bring.
    <br>Take note: Spirit is not only power - He gives power.
    <br>How To Be Born Again WITH POWER - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>The other meaning of power, ability, strength
    <br>refers to a person who has administrative power.
    <br>How To Be Born Again WITH POWER - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Power means ability, strength.
    <br>How To Be Born Again WITH POWER - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>God's purpose of sending the Holy Spirit was to empower Jesus' followers.
    <br>You are one.
    <br>But if you are not empowered, you are carrying out a dangerous mission.
    <br>If you are not tarrying until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power,
    <br>you are carrying out a dangerous mission.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"If you are not tarrying until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power,
    <br>you are carrying out a dangerous mission."
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again,
    <br>"If you are not tarrying until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power,
    <br>you are carrying out a dangerous mission."
    <br>Are you going out to preach, teach, tell people, "I'm a Christian, born again"?
    <br>A dangerous mission.
    <br>God's idea and God's opinion about your act of worship is that
    <br>they will be idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>God's opinion, God's idea about your act of worship,
    <br>in your home, you fast, you sing, whatever you are doing,
    <br>they will be meaningless, idle and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>If God cannot hear you, satan will hear you.
    <br>The challenges before us; we are in a perilous time.
    <br>Perilous time is a time when anything can happen.
    <br>Where God guides, He provides.
    <br>When you are guided by the Spirit of God,
    <br>even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
    <br>you will fear no one because God will protect you.
    <br>Why 'oftentimes destructive'?
    <br>Look at the seven sons of Sceva:
    <br>they have been calling the name of Jesus everywhere they went preaching,
    <br>saying, "In the name of Jesus, be healed".
    <br>But the Bible says, "One day" - one day means they have been doing it.
    <br>You have been calling the name 'Jesus'.
    <br>When you call the name 'Jesus', it is like you are abusing satan.
    <br>You say, "In the name of Jesus" - it is like you are saying, "Satan, you are foolish".
    <br>If you are saying, "In the name of Jesus!",
    <br>it is like you are saying, "Satan - be killed, idiot, stupid, bastard..." - that is what you are saying to satan.
    <br>Mere calling the name 'Jesus'...
    <br>If you are not calling that name by the Spirit of God, one day satan will catch up with you.
    <br>How To Be Born Again WITH POWER - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Now - the Spirit of God.
    <br>When you act on the Word of God, you are acting in unison with God.
    <br>When you make God's Word become part of you - living in you,
    <br>like your muscles and blood are part of you -
    <br>you and God are lifting the load.
    <br>Your responsibilities, cares, burdens - you and God are lifting them.
    <br>You and God are walking; you and God are facing persecution and trials together.
    <br>His strength and ability become yours.
    <br>There is a difference between religious worshipper and Christianity - take note of that.
    <br>We have seen what is going on all over the world.
    <br>The whole thing just started.
    <br>This is a perilous time.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We are to be sons of God with power".
    <br>We are to be Christians with power.
    <br>We are to be born again with power.
    <br>I cannot hear you - "We are to be born again with power".
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How To Be Born Again WITH POWER - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>If you have truly been born again, it was the Holy Spirit
    <br>who convicted you of sin and drew you into a relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"If you have truly been born again, it was the Holy Spirit
    <br>who convicted you of sin and drew you into a relationship with Jesus Christ".
    <br>How To Be Born Again WITH POWER - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let this come into your heart from time to time.
    <br>Once again I take it,
    <br>"...tarry in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power."
    <br>Jesus knew His followers could not fulfill the commission He had given them.
    <br>What is the commission?
    <br>To take the Gospel to all the nations -
    <br>until they were immersed in the power that the Holy Spirit would bring;
    <br>until they were immersed, baptized in the power that the Holy Spirit would bring.
    <br>The other meaning of power - strength, ability refers to a person who has administrative power.
    <br>You can see the mission, if you are a Christian.
    <br>God's purpose of sending the Holy Spirit was to empower Jesus' followers.
    <br>If you have truly been born again, it was the Holy Spirit
    <br>who convicted you of sin and drew you into a relationship.
