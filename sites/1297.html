  <p>    
    <br>On Sunday May 15th, 2016, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message about the nation of Venezuela.
    <br>These were his words:
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I will continue to pray on my own for your country and for the world.
    <br>But there is one now that is very, very close
    <br>which I will just say briefly -
    <br>Venezuela - it's a Spanish nation.
    <br>This Venezuelan country - I'm seeing...
    <br>which I'm praying that God should avert it -
    <br>I'm seeing a coup that will take them back to their...
    <br>I mean, that will throw away the democratic system of government.
    <br>Pray for this country because it is very close - that is why I'm saying this.
    <br>Anytime you pray, remember a nation like that.
