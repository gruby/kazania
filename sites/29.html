    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua everywhere you go.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, prepare your hearts to receive and get ready to pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, God Almighty will take you from glory to glory.
    <br>Pray along in faith in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>you also have been delivered but I need to face you.
    <br>This is face to face.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, I am in your bedroom.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, I am in your sitting room.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, I am inside the prison yard.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, I am underground, there.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, I am inside the aircraft.
    <br>Wherever you are, whatever position you are in, listen to me.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, begin to break the cycles and curses of that affliction,
    <br>the cycles and curses of your situation,
    <br>the cycle and curses in your family line.
    <br>Begin to break it in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>The cycle and curses of that affliction, the cycle and curses of that situation,
    <br>the cycle and curses of that infirmity,
    <br>the cycle and curses of that limitation in progress,
    <br>in your family line, break it, in the name of Jesus of Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord! In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>whatever medium you are using to watch this programme,
    <br>are you watching this programme through the internet,
    <br>are you watching by the medium of watching the screen,
    <br>Emmanuel TV or the internet?
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to watch this programme, listen to us.
    <br>I am giving you the prayer point today, take your pen and write.
    <br>Ask God at all times:
    <br>"Oh Lord, help me to live by faith -
    <br>faith in Your goodness and love, faith in Your healing power and deliverance,
    <br>faith in Your blessing and mercy,
    <br>faith in Your plan for my life, in Jesus Christ's name!"
    <br>Write it down, the word is anointed. When you say it, so shall it be.
    <br>It's not the word that you say by yourself
    <br>but it is the Word from the throne of Heaven.
    <br>So, when you say it, faith will come.
    <br>When you are praying with me on the screen,
    <br>you see the prayer on Emmanuel TV and it is difficult to believe that
    <br>one can be healed through merely watching the screen,
    <br>offer this prayer with me.
    <br>Help me Lord, to live by faith - faith in His goodness and love,
    <br>faith in Your healing power and deliverance,
    <br>faith in Your blessing and mercy, faith in Your plan for my life!
    <br>In Jesus' name! Let the people of God say, '"Amen!"
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>And the Lord will help you!
    <br>He will give you courage to hope, not to give up!
    <br>In Jesus' name. Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
