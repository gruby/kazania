    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say "Emmanuel!"
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>Right now turn to your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, God is good.
    <br>Whatever your situation, God is good.
    <br>Whatever life brings, God is good.
    <br>Even when everything looks bad, God is good."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>even when your situation suggests there is no hope, no way, no future,
    <br>God is good.
    <br>Therefore, no matter my situation, I will declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>No matter my circumstance, I will declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>No matter my challenges, I will declare God's faithfulness
    <br>because God is good.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>My name is Brother Chris.
    <br>It is a wonderful privilege to share the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ with you today.
    <br>As I stated in the beginning, God is good!
    <br>Because God is good, that is why we can bring our requests to Him,
    <br>share our concerns with Him and cast our cares upon Him
    <br>because He is good.
    <br>Your condition does not change God's position.
    <br>He is still on the throne.
    <br>He is still the steadfast One.
    <br>He is still trustworthy.
    <br>The Bible says even if we are faithless, God remains faithful.
    <br>Our God is faithful and true, a rock against which we can lean our faith,
    <br>even when the storms of life swirl and the winds of trouble howl around us,
    <br>we can depend on God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again, "God is good."
    <br>Now I want to do a very quick exercise to start today's message.
    <br>I believe everyone here brought something that they can write with.
    <br>I hope you have a pen and maybe some paper, notebook, you take notes of the message,
    <br>or you have any other instrument you want to use to write something down.
    <br>I want everyone to write down two things.
    <br>This includes our viewers all over the world; wherever you are watching, please,
    <br>look for a pen right now, or you can open your mobile phone, tablet, laptop.
    <br>Two things we are going to write down.
    <br>1. I want you to write down something that you are grateful to God for.
    <br>It could be anything - just write it down.
    <br>Something you are grateful to God for.
    <br>Perhaps it is good health, the time God rescued you, healed you, delivered you -
    <br>just name something you are grateful to God for.
    <br>Perhaps it is just the fact that you slept last night and woke up this morning.
    <br>Here you are breathing freely.
    <br>Write it down right now - something that you are grateful to God for.
    <br>2. I want you to write down something you can testify that God has done in your life.
    <br>That time He healed you, delivered you from addiction, affliction,
    <br>that time He rescued you from the valley of the shadow of death,
    <br>that accident that claimed lives that you miraculously escaped from.
    <br>Just take a time to review your track record
    <br>and write down something that you can testify to that God has done in your life.
    <br>If you are watching online right now on YouTube, you can type it as a comment right now.
    <br>We want to hear from you; one thing you are grateful to God for
    <br>and one thing that you can testify that God has done in your life.
    <br>Has everyone written these things down?
    <br>I'm not hearing you.
    <br>Has everyone written these down?
    <br>OK, because I want to hear a few of them.
    <br>If God puts it in your heart, you want to share with us what you have written,
    <br>just raise up your hand.
    <br>You want to share with us what you have written;
    <br>one thing you are grateful to God for and one thing that you can testify God has done in your life.
    <br>OK, let's go over here.
    <br>Alright, our sister - let's start with you.
    <br>You can just read out what you've written here.
    <br>What I've written: I'm grateful to God for my life because He has given me life
    <br>and the second thing is that I'm grateful because He has delivered me and healed me.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for our sister.
    <br>I think we can all agree to that, we are grateful to God for our life,
    <br>for the fact that we are alive, breathing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, here I am walking freely.
    <br>Here I am talking freely.
    <br>Here I am breathing freely."
    <br>Do you know that many people slept last night and didn't wake up this morning?
    <br>Here you are in the house of God - you have a reason to appreciate God.
    <br>OK, someone else who wants to share with us.
    <br>OK, madam here.
    <br>Just read out what you have written there, the two things that we asked you to write down.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My God has made me to know Him.
    <br>Formerly I did not know God - He has made me to know Him, and to have peace with people.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for our sister.
    <br>I like that - she is grateful to God that she knows Him.
    <br>She has the knowledge of God's saving grace.
    <br>Many people, as we are talking right now, do not have that knowledge of saving grace,
    <br>they live in ignorance.
    <br>But for you to have stepped your feet in the house of God today
    <br>is because you know who Jesus Christ is.
    <br>And you know that you have the assurance of life everlasting in Heaven with Him.
    <br>So you have a reason to appreciate God.
    <br>Let's go over here.
    <br>Anyone else want to share with us these two things what you have written down?
    <br>Anyone on the altar here would like to share with us?
    <br>OK, our sister over here.
    <br>I'm grateful to the Lord for salvation.
    <br>And I testify that God loves me.
    <br>Oh, let's put our hands together for our sister.
    <br>You can agree with that.
    <br>We are grateful to God for salvation and she can testify that God loves her.
    <br>In fact God loves us as much as He does any of His children.
    <br>Finally, let's hear from a gentleman.
    <br>I thank God, Lord Jesus Christ for saving my life from accident on the 1st of April -
    <br>that is number one.
    <br>Number two: God has been my help since I was born.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for our brother.
    <br>The reason we did this quick exercise is very simple.
    <br>I want to tell you that everyone here has a testimony.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Everyone has a testimony.
    <br>God never stops giving us reasons to praise Him,
    <br>to appreciate Him and to glorify Him."
    <br>If you begin to count your many blessings,
    <br>as we just briefly did in that exercise,
    <br>your grumbling would give way to praise.
    <br>When you begin to count your many blessings,
    <br>every doubt about God's presence in your life would fly.
    <br>When you begin to count your many blessings,
    <br>you would know that no matter your situation,
    <br>no matter your circumstance,
    <br>no matter your challenges, you would stand to declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>This is the power of acknowledgment:
    <br>God has done it before and He will do it again and again!
    <br>People of God, this brings us to the title of our word of encouragement today:
    <br>DECLARE GOD'S FAITHFULNESS
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Declare God's faithfulness."
    <br>Now, I want to start off with a very practical example.
    <br>I need some chairs - if you can help me bring out some chairs right now.
    <br>I want to use a very practical example to illustrate the importance
    <br>of declaring God's faithfulness in our daily lives.
    <br>That you have a testimony does not mean you don't face challenges.
    <br>Just as everyone has a testimony, everyone has a situation.
    <br>I'm just going to put these chairs out one by one.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to paint a picture of what many of us do in our journey through life.
    <br>We just did an exercise where we demonstrated the evidence that God has done so many things in our lives.
    <br>If we begin to count from the day we were born...
    <br>Even for many of us the circumstances surrounding our birth
    <br>were enough to stop us from coming into this world but here you are today.
    <br>If you begin to consider what God has done for you -
    <br>God has done so much in your life.
    <br>He has healed you, delivered you, rescued you, saved you, restored you,
    <br>He has done so much in your life.
    <br>But what many of us do today:
    <br>In the face of our current problem, our present trouble, our situation today,
    <br>we easily forget what God has done before.
    <br>The only thing we see is our trouble.
    <br>The only thing we look at is our situation.
    <br>The only thing we focus on is our giant.
    <br>And that trouble seems to become bigger than what we can handle, leading to fear, anxiety, desperation.
    <br>Whereas, if you just look back, you will see what God has done;
    <br>He has saved you here, rescued you, delivered you, restored you.
    <br>But yet, in the face of our current trouble, we easily panic
    <br>instead of declaring God's faithfulness.
    <br>I want to use a few Biblical examples to illustrate this truth.
    <br>I'm going to start of with the children of Israel.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Numbers in the Old Testament.
    <br>The Book of Numbers 13.
    <br>I want to set the scene before I read this Scripture.
    <br>You have heard the incredible testimony of the children of Israel.
    <br>We know they were in slavery, in bondage, in captivity for 430 years,
    <br>until God sent His servant Moses to liberate them from captivity
    <br>and you saw the hand of God in incredible manners
    <br>demonstrating His power and might in their presence.
    <br>He sent the plagues to the Egyptians to the point where Pharaoh said, "You can go.
    <br>Leave our country. Go with your cattle, your this, your that."
    <br>They were given liberty to leave - slaves in that country.
    <br>As they left, God guided them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
    <br>Even when they went to the Red Sea and the Egyptian army came after them,
    <br>you know what happened?
    <br>Moses stretched his staff of prayer, raised his hand
    <br>and the Red Sea divided before their very eyes.
    <br>Talk about a testimony.
    <br>If we had this testimony on YouTube today, it would have gone viral.
    <br>You saw the water part before your very eyes, you saw the hand of God...
    <br>Now, considering all of this, let's look at what happened when the children of Israel
    <br>finally reached their promised land.
    <br>I'm going to read Numbers 13:31.
    <br>Moses had sent people to spy in the promised land and this is the report they brought back; verse 31:
    <br>"But the men who had gone up with him said, 'We can't attack those people;
    <br>they are stronger than we are.'
    <br>And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored.
    <br>They said, 'The land we explored devours those living in it.
    <br>All the people we saw there are of great size.
    <br>We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak...).
    <br>We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.' "
    <br>Now, quickly to chapter 14:1:
    <br>"That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.
    <br>All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them,
    <br>'If only we had died in Egypt!' "
    <br>Quickly, turn with me to Deuteronomy 1.
    <br>You will see the way Moses himself described what happened.
    <br>Deuteronomy 1, from verse 29:
    <br>"Then I said to you, 'Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.
    <br>The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you,
    <br>as He did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes, and in the wilderness.
    <br>There you saw how the LORD your God carried you,
    <br>as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.'
    <br>In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God.' "
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Just try and imagine this scenario.
    <br>God had rescued them from Egypt, from slavery.
    <br>God had divided the Red Sea before their very eyes.
    <br>God went before them as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
    <br>God provided water in the desert, in the wilderness.
    <br>God provided manna from Heaven for them to eat.
    <br>There was even a time they were grumbling about meat.
    <br>God sent huge amount of birds to provide for them and apart of all this,
    <br>when they faced their giant, they forgot what God had done.
    <br>They only looked at the size of their giant and they fell into fear.
    <br>Instead of declaring God's faithfulness, they gave fear a place in their hearts
    <br>and fear paralysed their potential.
    <br>Fear tormented them.
    <br>Fear handcuffed them.
    <br>Fear increased the size of their enemy mentally.
    <br>Fear changed their focus from the promise of God to their present situation.
    <br>And you know what happened in that story.
    <br>The children of Israel ended up forfeiting the promise of God.
    <br>What is your giant today?
    <br>What is your circumstance?
    <br>What is your trouble?
    <br>If you look only at the outside of your trouble, it will seem bigger than what you can handle,
    <br>leading to discouragement, fear, worry, grumbling, complaining
    <br>and if you are not careful, leading you to take alternatives.
    <br>One of satan's tactics is to get you to doubt God's goodness and question His faithfulness.
    <br>Satan only wants you to look at the trouble now - the situation now.
    <br>He doesn't want you to look back at what God has done.
    <br>He tries to get you to forget what God has done for you,
    <br>forget how God has intervened in our life.
    <br>He wants you to focus on what you do not have.
    <br>Please take note of this warning:
    <br>If you spend too much time thinking about what you do not have,
    <br>you are likely going to slip into unhealthy doubt.
    <br>Now, I want to use another Biblical example of someone else who faced a giant
    <br>but reacted in a different way.
    <br>Turn with me to the Book of 1 Samuel 17.
    <br>We all know the story of David and Goliath - it is a well known story,
    <br>but I want to pinpoint a truth in verse 37.
    <br>When David was called to defend himself against Saul,
    <br>this is what he said in verse 37:
    <br>"The LORD who rescued me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear
    <br>will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine."
    <br>When David was called to defend his cause, he simply testified of how God had rescued him,
    <br>delivered him and saved him from the lion and the bear.
    <br>If David had looked at the size of Goliath,
    <br>if David had considered his intimidating stature,
    <br>his advanced weaponry, his military experience,
    <br>David would have been scared into submission.
    <br>But rather he chose to declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>Now, take note of this point, people of God:
    <br>Declaring God's faithfulness did not eliminate the giant;
    <br>it simply prepared David to face the giant in faith.
    <br>Declaring God's faithfulness does not eliminate your trouble;
    <br>it strengthens you, encourages you and prepares you to face that trouble.
    <br>And with God on your side, you will overcome.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>David had tried God in similar circumstances and found Him reliable,
    <br>he had found Him dependable, he had found Him steadfast.
    <br>At the beginning of this message I asked you to look back at your life
    <br>and consider what God has done for you since day one.
    <br>I think you will agree with me that you have tasted God and discovered that He is good.
    <br>You have tried God and found Him reliable.
    <br>You have tried God and found Him dependable.
    <br>You have tried God and found Him steadfast.
    <br>You have tried God and found Him real.
    <br>You have tried God and found Him true.
    <br>You have tried God and found Him reliable.
    <br>Why then would you face your giants and forget what God has done for you?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Declare God's faithfulness."
    <br>Your situation will always talk to you.
    <br>As you are facing your situation, your situation will talk to you
    <br>to try and mislead you, to try and deceive you.
    <br>Your situation will say things like, "You can't make it. You are not good enough.
    <br>No one in your family will overcome. You are destined for failure, destined for second best,
    <br>destined for second rate, destined for second. You are not going to make it."
    <br>If you listen to the voice of your situation, your situation will mislead you
    <br>and your situation will deceive you.
    <br>So what must you do?
    <br>You must take a stand
    <br>and say to your situation, "I refuse to submit to the voice of my situation.
    <br>I stand to declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>I refuse to submit to the suggestions of my circumstance
    <br>and I stand to declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>I refuse to listen to the lies of the devil
    <br>and I stand to declare God's faithfulness."
    <br>And as you hold fast to your confidence in God's Word, you will become an overcomer.
    <br>What do I mean by 'holding fast to your confidence in God's Word'?
    <br>Hold fast to your confidence in God's Word even when your faith is tested.
    <br>Whether He heals me or not, He is my Healer.
    <br>Whether He removes this situation or not, He is my Deliverer.
    <br>Whether He saves me or not, He is my Saviour.
    <br>Whether He restores me or not, He is my Restorer.
    <br>This is my confidence.
    <br>I have no other alternative.
    <br>I have no other way.
    <br>I have tried God and found Him reliable.
    <br>I have tried God and found Him dependable.
    <br>I have tried God and found Him true and worthy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People of God, as I draw to a conclusion of today's message,
    <br>I want you to understand one vital truth.
    <br>If you look at your journey in life thus far, you will realise this:
    <br>Where you are going is closer than where you are coming from.
    <br>Examine yourself.
    <br>Think of where you were at the beginning.
    <br>Think of what God has done.
    <br>Take time, create time to consider God's track record - that time He saved you.
    <br>That time He rescued you.
    <br>That time He prevented you from being implicated.
    <br>Many people are in prison today for something they know nothing about.
    <br>That time He saved you in the hands of people who hated you at your work place.
    <br>That time He healed you from that sickness.
    <br>That time He delivered you from that addiction.
    <br>That time He enabled you to discover a place like the arena of liberty,
    <br>Emmanuel TV where you were exposed to the wonderful truth of God's Word.
    <br>If God has seen you through all of this journey, He is going to see through to the end.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you review God's track record in your life,
    <br>you will grow confident that He will work in your present situation.
    <br>When you review God's track record in your life,
    <br>you will grow confident that your situation is not like others'; it is for the glory of God.
    <br>When you review God's track record in your life,
    <br>you will know that you serve a God who never leaves you,
    <br>who never abandons you, who never forsakes you.
    <br>When you review God's track record in your life, your grumbling will give way to praise.
    <br>People of God, God never stops giving us evidence to believe in Him.
    <br>Doubt comes, fear strikes, discouragement hits
    <br>when we fail to stop long enough to observe all of this evidence.
    <br>I pray that God will bless His Word in the midst of your heart
    <br>as you declare His faithfulness every day of your life, in Jesus' name.
