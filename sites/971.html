    <br>People of God: Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ngozi Christiana Njoku
    <br>The girl standing beside me is my daughter, and next to her is my lovely mother.
    <br>It started when I was young.
    <br>In the village, a girl asked me to go to the stream with her.
    <br>I said, "OK, let's go to the stream" and I went with her.
    <br>When we got to the stream, she was teaching me how to swim.
    <br>Later on, I realised I was far out in a river and I felt something pulling my leg strongly -
    <br>it was trying to pull me under the water.
    <br>So, I started screaming and a lady came and pulled me out of the river.
    <br>I thought everything was over, I went to my house and I didn't tell my mother or father.
    <br>In time, I started having strange dreams and strange things would happen to me.
    <br>I would see snakes and a woman coming to crown me in my dreams.
    <br>She was a very beautiful woman wearing a gown and a crown on her head.
    <br>She would always come in my dreams to put a crown on my head.
    <br>As time went on, I thought everything was over; I didn't explain my experience to anybody.
    <br>I was in primary school then, after primary school, I went to secondary school.
    <br>When I got into the secondary school, a lady came to me and said that she was my 'school mother'.
    <br>I became bi-sexual and I became pregnant but the boy said he was not the father
    <br>and he didn't know anything about it.
    <br>I told him there was no problem then, I called my parents in Cameroon
    <br>and told my mother all that had happened to me.
    <br>She said, "My daughter, don't worry, everything will be over.
    <br>After delivery, carry the child and come over to us here in Cameroon."
    <br>After I delivered my daughter, I took her to Cameroon; she was two months old.
    <br>She started growing up with my parents but along the line, I saw that she was living the same life I was living.
    <br>I said, "God, what is happening to us?"
    <br>What happened to me was that I would see women like men, I didn't value men.
    <br>That was what happened to me after the woman crowned me in the dream.
    <br>OK. You said that later on you got involved in a relationship with a man and gave birth to your daughter,
    <br>who stands beside you.
    <br>Can you tell us at what age you gave birth to your daughter?
    <br>At the age of 14, I gave birth to my daughter.
    <br>I saw she was living the same life I was living and she also got pregnant at the age of 14.
    <br>I made her abort two pregnancies.
    <br>She was disturbing everyone in the house, she would not sleep in the house, she would go out and smoke.
    <br>I was worried, so I went to all the herbalists in Cameroon.
    <br>They finished all my money; I am a hairdresser by profession.
    <br>The last herbalist told me to give him money so he would buy a live snake and bury the snake in a coffin.
    <br>I gave him money and bought the coffin; he buried them but everything became worse.
    <br>I didn’t know what was happening.
    <br>What was the purpose of your going to this native doctor, who requested a live snake to bury it?
    <br>What was the purpose of going to all these native doctors?
    <br>I went to the native doctor because of my daughter, not even for my own case.
    <br>But after performing all these sacrifices nothing happened?
    <br>Nothing happened, except that case got worse and worse.
    <br>Can you now tell us more about the lifestyle you lived, as a result of your encounter with the queen of the cost?
    <br>Tell us more about the lifestyle and your experiences in life.
    <br>The experience I had was that man would come and propose to me with engagement rings
    <br>but later, they would go and not come back.
    <br>I began to wonder what was happening to me, at my age I was not married;
    <br>I didn’t know it was the spirit woman that was disturbing me.
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV and said to myself,
    <br>‘If this beautiful lady could stand and testify to the world what the Lord has done then, who am I?
    <br>I know I am proud of myself but I will put my pride and beauty aside.
    <br>I know that one day, God will see me through and I will testify of what He has done for me’.
    <br>That was how I decided to travel back home to Nigeria.
    <br>That was last Friday but my daughter knew I had planned to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>She left the house on Friday and didn’t come home.
    <br>I was crying to God as I didn’t understand what was happening;
    <br>when I called her phone, she was not answering my call.
    <br>I prayed and said, “God of T.B. Joshua, wherever this girl is, please bring her home”.
    <br>It was already late in the afternoon.
    <br>I was sleeping and my phone rang, it was my daughter saying,
    <br>"Mummy, I'm coming back; don’t be angry, I don’t want you to beat me."
    <br>I told her that I would not beat her and that she would come,
    <br>so we could go where we had planned to go – we would get the night bus.
    <br>That was how we left our place and came here.
    <br>So, that Sunday, you were at The SCOAN.
    <br>Can you tell us what actually happened on that day?
    <br>I had stopped going to church; I hadn't gone to church for four to five years.
    <br>So, when I entered the gates I made a vow to God that I would continue going to church.
    <br>When it was time for Mass Prayer, a spirit asked me,
    <br>"The vow you made that you will be going to church, are you sure you will fulfill it?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, I will be going to church every Sunday, no matter what."
    <br>Immediately I finished saying that I saw myself on the floor and found myself at the altar.
    <br>Ngozi Christiana Njoku & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Tell us what happened afterwards.
    <br>I am very happy and I am proud to be here.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.
    <br>You are going to tell us the differences you have seen in your life, since you received your deliverance.
    <br>Can you now tell us once again, what was the life you were living in the past and what God has done for you?
    <br>Since I was delivered, when I see a woman, I see her as a woman and when I see a man, I see him as a man.
    <br>Before, I had relationships with women and I didn't see men as men - I saw women like men.
    <br>But now, when I see women, I see them as women and men as men.
    <br>I thank God for that.
    <br>Yesterday, my brother called me and asked how much I owed for store rent since I travelled to Niegeria
    <br>and how much I owed for my house rent - I was surprised.
    <br>This has never happened to me before!
    <br>No one had called to ask of my debts to pay, I was happy!
    <br>He promised that he would pay the rent.
    <br>Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>You have just listened to this life changing testimony from our sister,
    <br>who has been separated from the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>She said that in the past she had been living a very rough life and she was bisexual.
    <br>She was attracted to women like herself.
    <br>Her life, in a nutshell, was not in accordance with God's Word.
    <br>But that is her past.
    <br>As you know, Jesus Christ enters our lives to put an end to our past and give birth to our future.
    <br>That is exactly what God has done in the life of our sister.
    <br>Today, she is testifying that her past is indeed over.
    <br>Once again, let us rejoice with our sister by putting our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour -
    <br>Jesus Christ.
    <br>Before we go on, we want to listen to your advice, concerning what God has done in your life.
    <br>You mentioned your daughter, who is standing beside you.
    <br>We know she is going to be in the best position to share with us her testimony.
    <br>Before listening to her, we are going to watch TV once again, and see how she had received her deliverance.
    <br>Let us stay tuned.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>The power of God flows through the faculties of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>bringing healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings into the lives of the people,
    <br>who have come to The SCOAN.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to pray for them, he encounters this lady,
    <br>who immediately begins to manifest.
    <br>Let's see what happens.
    <br>Who are you that destroyed the family?!
    <br>I am a queen!
    <br>How many of you are in this body
    <br>We are four!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>I will destroy her family!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>My names are Anastasia Chinoso.
    <br>I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I'm 18 years old.
    <br>At the age of 13 I was raped.
    <br>Since then my eyes were opened.
    <br>If I were sent to buy an egg, I would run away and never come back.
    <br>I would not come back home for one year and a month.
    <br>My mum sent some people to hold me but they would not see me.
    <br>When she sent me to school, I wouldn't go there directly.
    <br>I would just hang around with boys, smoke and drink, I would not concentrate on my education.
    <br>I was raped at the age of 13 years.
    <br>I was living a bad life, sleeping with men...
    <br>I got pregnant two times - these children were aborted.
    <br>Then my mum changed my school.
    <br>I was still living the same life, going around, smoking, going to clubs.
    <br>I would not concentrate.
    <br>When my mum was sending me anywhere, I would not come back, I would run away.
    <br>Even when I was at home with my mum, I wouldn't hear or obey her when she talked to me.
    <br>My grandmother and sisters - everybody in the family hated me because of my attitude and bad life.
    <br>They have changed my school seven times.
    <br>Seven times your mum changed your school, hoping that you would meet good friends.
    <br>Are you saying that all this did not bring any results?
    <br>Yes, she changed my school thinking that all this was because of my bad friends, but nothing changed.
    <br>That is how it was.
    <br>Friday, last week my mum told me that we would be going to T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I said OK.
    <br>In the afternoon, at around 3 o'clock she went out.
    <br>Then I decided not to go to T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My friend took me out of the house.
    <br>Since then my mum has been calling, to ask where I was.
    <br>I did not answer her calls.
    <br>She called one of my friends, asking her to bring me because we were expected to go to T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My friend said OK.
    <br>My friend called me and told me that my mum was looking for me and to go back home.
    <br>I said that I heard the message.
    <br>My mum called me again but I didn't pick up the phone.
    <br>Five minutes later my mum called me again.
    <br>I didn't want to pick up the phone because I didn't want to go anywhere.
    <br>So, what finally happened?
    <br>Five minutes later I was going home.
    <br>I called my mum before reaching home.
    <br>I told her that I was very sorry and I didn't want go back home because I was afraid that she would beat me.
    <br>She said, that I should come back home and that she would not beat me.
    <br>She said that we were going somewhere - I said "OK".
    <br>I came back home and then we entered the night bus and came here.
    <br>While entering the church, T.B. Joshua was coming near me.
    <br>I was so afraid.
    <br>I felt fire - it was burning my legs and my body.
    <br>That is when T.B. Joshua prayed for me and delivered me.
    <br>Now, I'm free.
    <br>Before I had dreams of snakes and other bad things.
    <br>But now, since T.B. Joshua delivered me...
    <br>I really thank God for what He did to me.
    <br>I do not have any bad dreams anymore.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm free.
    <br>When I went out, men would sleep with me.
    <br>They would only make promises and do nothing, they would only sleep with me.
    <br>So did big men, so did little boys...
    <br>How would you describe this type of life you were living then, in one word?
    <br>I was living a bad life, I didn't attend school regularly, I didn't concentrate on my education.
    <br>You have heard from our sister that in the past she was going out with different type of men, to the extent that
    <br>she had abandoned her school, and had no focus on her education.
    <br>Her life was focused mainly on men.
    <br>That was a kind of life she was living.
    <br>We can conclude what this kind of life is all about.
    <br>After your deliverance, can you tell us the changes you have seen in yourself?
    <br>The changes I have seen in myself: I don't have bad dreams anymore, I don't go out, I don't smoke or drink.
    <br>I really thank God for what T.B. Joshua did for me.
    <br>I really appreciate what he did for me.
    <br>Parents; I really want you to always take care of your children and focus on God.
    <br>Since your deliverance - you testify that that urge you used to have,
    <br>that pushed you to go out with different kind of men,
    <br>and made you to lose focus on your education is no more?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus for this wonderful thing He has done in the life of this sister,
    <br>rescuing her out of the captivity of satan, and bringing her back to light.
    <br>We give glory to God what He has done in your life.
    <br>I also thank you for that wonderful advice.
    <br>This woman here is my grandmother, and this one is my lovely mother.
    <br>Let us here from the grandmum.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Elizabeth Njoku.
    <br>What I learnt last week about my daughter and granddaughter was terrible.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, may God bless you, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>This is my first daughter and at times, she would be angry towards me.
    <br>When I talked to her, she would get annoyed and talk back to me rudely.
    <br>Since she has been delivered, there is nothing wrong with her anymore.
    <br>What about your gran daughter?
    <br>My granddaughter always disturbed me; I even wanted to die because of her.
    <br>I prayed to God Almighty to bless this girl for me, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>Tell us more about the lifestyle she lived then.
    <br>At times, when I would take her to the farm, she would run away from the farm.
    <br>If I sent her to buy me eggs, she would buy three, so it wouldn’t be enough;
    <br>so I would send her to buy three to five more eggs then, I wouldn’t see her again.
    <br>She would go out for two weeks, before coming here.
    <br>We heard from the grandmum; to the glory of God - she told us about the kind of life
    <br>the daughter and granddaughter lived in the past, before their deliverance.
    <br>Firstly, she talked about her daughter - she said that she was possessed
    <br>and that evil spirit made her to be very angry.
    <br>This anger created a lot of problems between the daughter and herself.
    <br>Whatever she told her, she would not listen.
    <br>But since her daughter's deliverance, she has seen a big difference in her - now she is a calm person.
    <br>She was telling us also about her granddaughter, the lifestyle she lived in the past -
    <br>she would leave the house and not return in days.
    <br>Tell us more about the kind of lifestyle your granddaughter was living then.
    <br>She was smoking, drinking alcohol and going to clubs.
    <br>When I looked for her but didn’t see her, I would ask God to bring her back safely.
    <br>The woman said that when she would take her granddaughter to the farm,
    <br>she would just disappear and wouldn't be seen for days.
    <br>She then engaged in a vigorous prayer to get her granddaughter back home.
    <br>Tell us how the lifestyle of your daughter affected you.
    <br>What kind of men did you see going out and spending time with her?
    <br>How did this affect her education in her childhood?
    <br>The men were many, I cannot count them; there were a lot.
    <br>I saw a few of them and when I saw them, I drove them away from my compound.
    <br>She would get angry and ask why I drove them away and I would tell her,
    <br>"This is my house, it does not belong to you".
    <br>The grandmother is explaining that the granddaughter was living a very bad life,
    <br>she was going out with a lot of men - she cannot even give account of the number of men
    <br>she used to go out with.
    <br>A lot of men would throng in her compound to see her granddaughter.
    <br>She would have to spend time driving these men away from her compound, making it known to them clearly
    <br>that this house belonged to her and not them, so they should not come to her compound again.
    <br>Tell us more, madam.
    <br>At my age, I was born in 1960, it was not easy to look after her.
    <br>God used T.B. Joshua to settle everything that has to do with her.
    <br>So, I too am free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Madam, can you now tell us once again, since your daughter's deliverance, tell us exactly
    <br>what are the changes, big differences, you have noticed in the life of your granddaughter?
    <br>She had anger before but now, she is at peace with her mother.
    <br>She has really changed now, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Sister, can you tell us your own advice to people listening to you all over the world?
    <br>My advice to the world is, I will use what Prophet T.B. Joshua said last Sunday,
    <br>for gold to be gold, it must face challenges and to face challenges you need faith.
    <br>People all around the world, have faith – distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Leave your beauty, leave your pride and everything behind – just come to God;
    <br>confess your sins and be free just as I did, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Ngozi Christiana Njoku & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We heard from our sister; no matter the problem or situation you face in life - you should run to God,
    <br>and He is able to see you through.
    <br>Yes, we give glory to God for what He has done in your life and we thank you for a wonderful advice.
    <br>We want to advise you - that God Almighty has taken you out of the kingdom of darkness and brought you
    <br>into the Kingdom of Light - the primary reason for this is the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Make sure you stand firm in the Word of God, make His Word a foundation of your life and your home
    <br>and that Word will continue to set you on the good road to the good life.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
    <br>for what He has done in the life of this family.
