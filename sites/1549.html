  <p>    
    <br>People of God!
    <br>At some level in life we all hunger for meaning in our lives;
    <br>we all thirst for purpose in our lives, for truth, for reality.
    <br>If you take a look at what is happening in society today,
    <br>you will realise that many people do not have a well defined purpose for their lives.
    <br>The masses out there are merely wandering, unsure of their goals, their dreams,
    <br>their purpose in life.
    <br>A man without a purpose is a man without direction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Services
    <br>You can liken it to a boat in the middle of a sea and as a storm suddenly brews, you see that boat
    <br>being pushed left and right, front and back,
    <br>it goes north and then south and then east and then west, no direction.
    <br>This is a picture  of what is happening to many in our generation today.
    <br>People today do things out of general trend rather than personal conviction.
    <br>You see people following man's majority instead of God's authority.
    <br>You see people listening to the testimony of the crowd
    <br>instead of listening to the testimony of their conscience.
    <br>People are so easily influenced by what they see, what they hear, what they read,
    <br>what they watch, what other people tell them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remember, people of God, what the psalmist said.
    <br>He said in Psalm 12:2,
    <br>"Everyone lies to his neighbour. Whom then can we believe?"
    <br>Where then is truth in a world that is so dominated by falsehood?
    <br>In the midst of all these voices,
    <br>in the midst of all these different philosophies and theories and ideologies
    <br>how can we discern between what is true and what is false, between what is fantasy and what is reality?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Services
    <br>People of God, I have a very simple message for you today.
    <br>The only source of truth in this world is the living Word of God.
    <br>There is no reality outside of God.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and say: "Neighbour,
    <br>there is no reality outside of God."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is none.
    <br>He is the Way, the Truth, the Life.
    <br>He is the Beginning, the Middle and the End.
    <br>In this journey in life, in this journey through life, in Him we must set out,
    <br>in Him we must go on and in Him we must finish up.
    <br>It is all about Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So many people today are living without direction because they so easily tossed around
    <br>by the winds and the waves and the storms of life.
    <br>People of God,
    <br>everything in this world is subject to change.
    <br>Feelings, emotions - they can change.
    <br>Circumstances, situations - they can change.
    <br>Position, possessions change.
    <br>The only thing that will remain the same yesterday, today and forever is the Word of God.
    <br>That is the only thing that remains stable in an unstable world, steady in an unsteady world,
    <br>constant in a changing world.
    <br>For your life to be steady, for your life to be stable,
    <br>for your life to have purpose and meaning, you must build your life on the truth of God's Word.
    <br>In other words,
    <br>stop living in fantasy and return to reality.
    <br>This brings us to the title of today's message.
    <br>RETURN TO REALITY
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Stop living in fantasy and return to reality.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of 1 Peter 1:23-25.
    <br>"For you have been born again, not of perishable seed
    <br>but of imperishable seed, through the living and enduring Word of God."
    <br>Verse 24.
    <br>For, "All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field;
    <br>the grass withers and flowers fall
    <br>but the Word of the Lord endures forever."
    <br>I repeat once again.
    <br>"...the grass withers and the flowers fall.
    <br>but the Word of the Lord endures forever."
    <br>Everything in this world has an expiry date.
    <br>Fame is fading.
    <br>Beauty is fleeting.
    <br>Position is passing.
    <br>Just take a look at history.
    <br>The President of today can be the prisoner of tomorrow.
    <br>The big man in society today can be the beggar on the street tomorrow.
    <br>The star, the celebrity, the icon today
    <br>can be the suicide victim tomorrow.
    <br>Satan can destroy in a second what you have built for years without God.
    <br>But despite this evidence, despite what's happening in our lives and in society,
    <br>it is so painful today to see people, especially the young people of our generation -
    <br>to see people spend so much of their precious time,
    <br>consume so much of their energy, devote so much of their attention to the pursuit 
    <br>of these fading things that can not fulfill them.
    <br>We need to ask why.
    <br>Why do people continue to chase after and run after and seek these things?
    <br>And I believe the answer is very simple.
    <br>For many people today, their lives are based on fantasy, not reality.
    <br>This fantasy has eaten deep into the fabric of our society.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Services
    <br>Today people's understanding of success is often based on fantasy.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>They measure success by how much material possessions they gain or earn or get,
    <br>how much money you make, how much possessions you acquire,
    <br>how much your name is known -
    <br>these seem to be a signal of success to many people of the world today.
    <br>In the same vein, their understanding of process is based on fantasy.
    <br>Process.
    <br>They feel they can just walk on a red carpet to success.
    <br>They can reap where they have not sown.
    <br>They do not involve any pain in the process to get there.
    <br>Take a look at what's happening in society.
    <br>I wanna give you a few examples of this.
    <br>This is true all over the world but most especially here in Africa in Nigeria where I had the privilege of living
    <br>for so many years. There is this fantasy that the grass is always greener on the other side.
    <br>I just need to travel abroad at all cost. If I can just get out of my country, my nation, 
    <br>then I will suddenly automatically find success or peace or purpose.
    <br>When you see people today...
    <br>We at the SCOAN have received countless thousands of young Nigerians deported from the nation of Libya
    <br>trying to reach Europe at all cost.
    <br>And they have lost everything for the pursuit of fantasy.
    <br>Young, intelligent, vibrate men and women.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many of them even lost their lives on a journey
    <br>that they would not even reach their destination.
    <br>Because they have been driven by this fantasy, that I just have to get out, I have to travel, I have to be there.
    <br>And the reality is this, brethren, that every nation has it's challenges.
    <br>The answer is not where you want to be; the answer is where God wants you to be.
    <br>It's not where you are that counts; it's who you are.
    <br>I'm not saying there's anything wrong in travelling abroad,
    <br>if it's in God's way and God's time and in line with your destiny.
    <br>But don't give your life away to this fantasy.
    <br>Let me give you another example.
    <br>In our society today there is this fantasy that money answers all things.
    <br>People today want to make money at costs, no matter the cost.
    <br>You see people today, they are ready to steal, kill, destroy to get money.
    <br>People have sacrificed their values, morals, dignity, conscience to try and get money.
    <br>The reality is that treasures here on earth have a habit of disappointing their owner.
    <br>Only treasure stored in heaven is permanent.
    <br>If your life is focused on only making money, a large slice of life will pass you by.
    <br>But the young people today and our society want to make money at all costs.
    <br>It is a fantasy.
    <br>What about the way we view our appearance, our image?
    <br>Today the fantasy is that, "It is about how I look,  my appearance, how I present myself."
    <br>You see people today are so consumed, so concerned about what people say about them,
    <br>how they look, how they appear.
    <br>People are even living beyond their means to try and fit in with a certain crowd
    <br>or move in a certain way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me tell you, people of God.
    <br>The people you are dressing to impress do not own your future.
    <br>The people you are striving to please do not hold your destiny.
    <br>The reality is that your worth, your value, is not determined by how you look,
    <br>or what people say about you.
    <br>You are what God says you are, you have what God says you have
    <br>and you can do what God says you can do.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The danger in this fantasy is that you can never be fulfilled.
    <br>Let me ask for one volunteer, please.
    <br>Very quick example. Ok, thank you very much, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I just want to show to you in a very practical way
    <br>the danger of giving your life to a fantasy.
    <br>Sir, this is what you are looking for; you want this, this is what you are after
    <br>and I want you to take a step and take it from me. Take a step.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This keep getting further.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Stop!
    <br>This is a picture of fantasy.
    <br>Each step you take thinking you will get what you are looking for
    <br>seems to make the journey longer.
    <br>And before you realise it, you are back to where you started
    <br>and you still haven't got what you want.
    <br>RETURN TO REALITY
    <br>It's like chasing shadows instead of pursuing substance.
    <br>Thank you, sir, you can take the apple. God bless you. Have your seat.
    <br>This is a picture of people pursuing fantasy.
    <br>So I put this question to you today, people of God.
    <br>Is your life based on the reality of God's Word or the fantasy of this world?
    <br>Your marriage, your business, your home, your finances -
    <br>are they built on the reality of God's Word or the fantasy of this world?
    <br>This is a question for you to ponder on today.
    <br>Because, people of God,
    <br>if you build your life on fantasy, you build your house on sand.
    <br>We know the parable in that book of
    <br>Matthew 7:24-27.
    <br>The parable of the wise man who built his house upon the rock
    <br>and the parable of the foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
    <br>I am going to jump straight to verse 27, it says this,
    <br>for the man who built his house on the sand, it says this:
    <br>"The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew
    <br>and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have some sand here today. Take a look.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is sand.
    <br>No matter how big you build your house, no matter how beautiful it looks,
    <br>no matter how much time and energy you've spent on building this beautiful house -
    <br>if your foundation is sand, when the streams and the winds and the waves of life hit,
    <br>your building will collapse.
    <br>Many dreams today are built on sand; that's why they collapse.
    <br>When the rains of failure fall, when the floods of disappointment rise,
    <br>when the winds of betrayal hit, the dream quickly turns into a nightmare.
    <br>Many marriages today are built on the sand of fantasy.
    <br>You see people marry today because, "This man is handsome; this woman is beautiful."
    <br>Your bodies agree but your hearts don't agree
    <br>and the marriage becomes competition instead of cooperation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What happens, when the rains of marital challenges come down,
    <br>when the floods of jealousy and envy come up,
    <br>when the winds of temptation beat against the marriage?
    <br>The marriage collapses, ends in divorce.
    <br>And innocent children end up being brought up in a broken home.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many businesses today are built on the sand of fantasy.
    <br>You are doing the business, not because it's what you love, not because it's what gives you joy -
    <br>is what your saw your friend do that succeeds.
    <br>Your business is based on imitation, not inspiration.
    <br>What happens? The rains of failure come down
    <br>and the floods of disappointment come up,
    <br>the winds of debt blow the business.
    <br>And the business...
    <br>collapses.
    <br>RETURN TO REALITY
    <br>I pointed to you again today.
    <br>Is your life built on the sinking sands of fantasy or solid rock of God's Word?
    <br>In life there are trials, troubles - challenges are part and parcel of greatness.
    <br>This doctrine that "no challenges, no sickness
    <br>no hardship in my journey to the throne" is fantasy,
    <br>it is not rooted in the reality of God's Word.
    <br>It is fantasy!
    <br>The Bible says, "In this world there will be trouble."
    <br>It is only in Heaven there's no disturbance.
    <br>A mature Christian is tested by his ability to face problems and deal with difficulties.
    <br>But if your life is based on this fantasy, when trouble comes, disappointment strikes,
    <br>failure comes, what happens?
    <br>You begin to react emotionally - you react intellectually to your situation.
    <br>What do I mean by "react emotionally"?
    <br>You base your spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.
    <br>When your prayer is not answered,
    <br>you feel like God is being unfair to you,
    <br>you feel like God is being unjust to you.
    <br>You begin to look at God in a bad light.
    <br>You feel He has not heard your prayers.
    <br>You begin to compare yourself with others.
    <br>You find yourself complaining, grumbling, moaning,
    <br>worrying, wondering, and before you know it, your situation misleads you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Or you react intellectually to your challenges.
    <br>What do I mean? You respond to reason instead of the Word of God.
    <br>If you have faith in anything, it is in what man has done - science, works, organisation.
    <br>You look for people who will give you advice -  good-intentioned people giving you advice
    <br>from a human point of view.
    <br>You receive help that is not sanctioned by God.
    <br>You look for shortcuts and alternatives to try and escape from reality.
    <br>It does not take you long to realise that these shortcuts,
    <br>these alternatives have a habit of disappointing you.
    <br>In the process of looking for shortcuts
    <br>you begin to do things without reference to God until you come to a dead end.
    <br>People of God,
    <br>shortcuts do not work.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, look at them very well, say: "Neighbour,
    <br>shortcuts do not work".
    <br>You see someone come to you and say: "Follow this way, you can get money very quickly!"
    <br>You see someone come to you and say: "Look, there is way you can cheat on this exam, get the answers."
    <br>You see someone that comes and says: "This is the easy way out, no stress, no struggles."
    <br>Run away!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If the process is not of God, the end is always bad.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look.
    <br>There is no shortcut to success because life is a marathon, not a sprint.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may look at me and say: "But brother Chris, but this guy at my work place, he did it and got away with it.
    <br>What of that lady in school, she cheated and it seems she has got her results.
    <br>Why you keep talking like this, people get away with this stuff!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may seem to get away with it, but you can not get away with peace.
    <br>RETURN TO REALITY
    <br>There is a relationship between truth and peace
    <br>because what comes from God goes to Him.
    <br>What comes from truth goes to truth.
    <br>What comes from stealing goes to stealing.
    <br>What comes from destruction goes to destruction.
    <br>If your life is based on fantasy, you can never have real peace,
    <br>you can never have real joy.
    <br>You may create happiness for a moment but you can't have eternal joy.
    <br>You may be able to fake a smile to deceive people; you can't fake peace of heart.
    <br>No matter how clever and cunning you are as a thief,
    <br>you can steal anything in this world but no one can steal peace of heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can even do plastic surgery to alter your appearance, your physical appearance.
    <br>But no surgeon can stitch up the wounds of your conscience.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Psalmist said in Psalm 84:10:
    <br>"Better is one day in the house of God than thousand elsewhere."
    <br>People of God, as I bring this message to a conclusion
    <br>I want to repeat.
    <br>In life there are storms, in life there are trials, in life there are troubles.
    <br>So the only way to stay steady, steadfast in a world that is unsteady
    <br>is to build your life upon the solid rock of God's Word.
    <br>On Christ the Solid Rock I stand
    <br>All other ground is sinking sand
    <br>Your anchor must be securely fastened to God's Word
    <br>or else your faith may get shipwrecked when the storms, the winds and the rains hit.
    <br>We must come back to God's Word -
    <br>return to reality, build our foundation on the living truth of God's Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God's Word is a tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit to nurture us,
    <br>to furnish us with everything we need to succeed here on earth.
    <br>The Word helps man to walk with God, to receive from God
    <br>and to fulfill God's will on earth, as it is in Heaven.
    <br>So what is the way out?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What do we need to do now to return to reality?
    <br>It's very simple, people of God.
    <br>RETURN TO REALITY
    <br>Spend more time feeding your spirit than you do feeding your flesh.
    <br>Give more attention to satisfying your soul than you do to satisfying your senses.
    <br>You must embrace the wonderful Word of God as the most effective instrument for change
    <br>because feeding on God's Word is feeding on God's wisdom,
    <br>feeding on God's ability, feeding on God's very life.
    <br>As we feed on the Word of God, it cultivates us, it strengthens us,
    <br>it builds up our spiritual life, it builds faith into us,
    <br>it builds God's ability into us,
    <br>it builds into us every attractive thing we see in the life of Jesus,
    <br>it makes the Word a reality to us.
    <br>When the Word becomes a reality,  we become Word-minded and God-minded.
    <br>The Word of God becomes the database for our personal opinion,
    <br>the Word of God prevails over sense-evidence, over thinking processes.
    <br>So people of God, in a simple conclusion -
    <br>if you have taken God's Word to heart and truly made it part of you,
    <br>it will by its very nature change you.
    <br>When it does you will find yourself called to act with God,
    <br>you will get God's opinion of yourself and others,
    <br>you will work with His projects, get His ideas, see life as He sees it.
    <br>It does not mean there will not be challenges.
    <br>Challenges will come but your focus will be on your Comforter instead of your enemy.
    <br>You will be discussing your faith in God instead of your doubts,
    <br>you will be discussing the promise of victory instead of your warfare,
    <br>you will be discussing the One who is fighting for you instead of your battle
    <br>because you know, truth never looses the battle.
    <br>No matter how long a lie is sustained, the truth will someday prevail.
    <br>No matter how fast a lie runs, the truth will someday overtake it.
    <br>So stop living in fantasy.
    <br>Return to reality of God's Word.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
