    <br>That your blood - be free from sickness!
    <br>Your organs - be free from sickness, infirmity!
    <br>His healing hand is on you!
    <br>Jesus' healing hand is on you!
    <br>Be healed!
    <br>Be delivered!

    <br>Open your lips and begin...
    <br>Unforgiveness, unbelief, doubt - give way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to give way!
