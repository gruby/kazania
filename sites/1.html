    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature and although
    <br>it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>As this woman sits down at the SCOAN,
    <br>we can tell by the look on her face that she is in a great deal of pain and discomfort.
    <br>As the camera moves down here body; what is revealed is a gustily wound at the top of her thigh,
    <br>which has become cancerous.
    <br>The woman by name Adia Umina had come to the SCOAN  with pelvic cancer dripping with pus.
    <br>The open sore causes Adia great pain and her face tells the sad story of what she is going through.
    <br>The pelvic cancer had already eaten deep into the flesh of her right thigh,
    <br>which hangs disfigured as the sickness digs deeper yet.
    <br>As the camera pulls out, we see that the cancer is located at the top of the thigh of her right leg.
    <br>Ordinarily someone in this condition would have little hope of recovering their leg from such an affliction.
    <br>The life depending on painful amputation to survive.
    <br>However, faith makes that which seems to be against us to be for us.
    <br>Let us hear from the woman as she waits for prayer at the SCOAN
    <br>Madam tell us what is your name.(Adia Umina)
    <br>Tell us what  is the problem that brought you to SCOAN today.
    <br>Cancer in my body.
    <br>You say the cancer brought you to Synagogue today?
    <br>Yes
    <br>It is painful; l cannot sleep. I am worried and  I cannot walk.
    <br>Where did you go for help?
    <br>I had been to the chemist to search for solution.
    <br>How did you know about Synagogue.
    <br>Somebody directed me to the SCOAN
    <br>I believe that God will heal me of the sickness.
    <br>With that belief in her heart that Jesus Christ was able to heal her
    <br>as she sat silently before the mountain of her life.
    <br>She was arranged in The Synagogue Church Of All Nations Prayer Line for prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Here she sat at the prayer line of Synagogue Church Of All Nations with an open wound of a pelvic cancer
    <br>praying to attract God's attention and commitment through the Man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>As she receives prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit she rises to her feet.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua uses his hand as a point of contact and prays for her
    <br>and tells her to go for she has been set free.
    <br>Jesus Christ the miracle worker has done it again in her life.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Some months later Adia Umina came back to the SCOAN
    <br>to show how the Lord Jesus Christ had performed the word of His servant and healed her body completely.
    <br>There is only a scar remaining of the once malignant pelvic cancer
    <br>which had threatened her life.
    <br>Now healed, she taps the place.
    <br>Do you feel pain?
    <br>No.
    <br>Now tell us what was the problem that brought you to SCOAN.
    <br>It is cancer
    <br>You mean pelvic cancer?
    <br>Yes
    <br>The problem is over. I am happy and I thank God.
    <br>Where did you go to look for solution to that kind of problem?
    <br>I went to hospital and spent a lot money but there was no solution.
    <br>I nearly died before I was brought here to SCOAN.
    <br>You mean to say there was no solution before you came to SCOAN? (Yes)
    <br>Madam let us see that place again.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>All that remains of the life threatening sore is this thin mark on her thigh.
    <br>Who else could justly heal her?
    <br>Who else could justly restore her?
    <br>Who else could have done this but Jesus Christ?
    <br>So glad was she at the hand work of God in her life that she shows the place and taps it once again
    <br>demonstrating that there is no more pain.
    <br>Do you feel pain?
    <br>I no longer feel any pain.
    <br>Before, it was like a big hole.
    <br>My leg was nearly amputated.
    <br>With the healing complete Adia Umina then gave a testimony live at the church.
    <br>My name is Adia Umina. I am from Cross River States.
    <br>What was the problem that brought you to the SCOAN?
    <br>It was cancer.
    <br>I had been to hospital and herbalist in search of a  solution.
    <br>I had spent a lot of money to the extend that I didn't have money anymore.
    <br>I nearly died.
    <br>It was my neighbour who directed me to SCOAN
    <br>When I was brought to the prayer line, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was used by God to heal you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua did not even touch my head,
    <br>he just stretched his hand towards me and I was healed.
    <br>So he just shook his hand towards you.
    <br>So what happened immediately?
    <br>From there , I felt coldness in my body and I was healed.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Just open that place and let us see the place where the problem was there before.
    <br>As she testifies to the congregation Adia Umina lifts up her clothes
    <br>to show the evidence of God's miracle in her life.
    <br>Now without pain she vigorously taps it
    <br>to prove beyond doubt that she is completely healed.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>I don't feel pain anymore.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus one more time.
