    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise the Lord, Church!
    <br>My name is Ogbonna Iwuogbonnaya.
    <br>I am from Abia State, Nigiera, living in Libya.
    <br>My testimony goes like this: I am a gas welder by profession.
    <br>One day, a customer brought me an item to work on in my shop.
    <br>When I started the work, I had already checked to see if the gas was working properly.
    <br>However, immediately when I started working, the gas exploded.
    <br>As it exploded, I didn't know again where I was.
    <br>I was very confused to the extent that I could not open my eyes.
    <br>I called my driver who took me to a private hospital.
    <br>When we reached there, they said they couldn't do anything and directed me to another hospital.
    <br>When I reached there, I met more than five Libyan citizens sitting there with different cases.
    <br>After waiting more than thirty minutes, I told my driver that we had to leave.
    <br>The driver was confused and asked why because he knew I was in severe pain.
    <br>I couldn't even sit down or touch my face because the pain was too much for me.
    <br>I couldn't bear the pain and told my driver that we should go.
    <br>You mean when you were being taken to the first hospital, you were completely rejected?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because your face was completely damaged, burnt?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>And they couldn't attend to you?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>From there, you were taken to the second hospital?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you got there, there were no doctors to attend to your case.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>So what happened from there?
    <br>From there, I remembered that I had Morning Water in my house; I used to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I had seen God using Prophet T.B. Joshua to heal many people.
    <br>I decided to return to my house.
    <br>The pain was so much that I didn't even know where I was.
    <br>The pain was so severe that I couldn't even touch my face.
    <br>More than five people were fanning me even though I was in an air-conditioned room.
    <br>You mean the burning sensation was so severe?
    <br>So severe.
    <br>That you could not even touch your face?
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>You couldn't even open your eyes?
    <br>I could not open my eyes; I even thought that my eyes had been blinded.
    <br>You thought you were blind?
    <br>I thought I had been blinded.
    <br>When I ministered the Morning Water on my face, immediately my eyes opened!
    <br>I said, "What is this?"
    <br>So, the first time that you ministered the Morning Water on your face, you could open your eyes clearly?
    <br>Is this what you are saying?
    <br>It was when I ministered the Morning Water that I was able to see what had happened to me.
    <br>Immediately after ministering the Morning Water, I took a mirror and looked at myself.
    <br>I said, "Oh God!" I thanked God.
    <br>I continued ministering the Morning Water and gradually, without taking medication,
    <br>my face started healing and the wound drying.
    <br>Put your hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>Indeed, we are serving a mighty God.
    <br>We want you to show us - we can see some pictures on the board next to you.
    <br>Can you please tell us what these pictures stand for.
    <br>This is a picture of when the incident happened.
    <br>On the screen of our television, we can see the picture of when the incident took place - when he was affected.
    <br>When I began ministering the Morning Water, my face started peeling, as you can see in this picture.
    <br>So that is when the burnt skin started peeling off, after the ministration of the Morning Water?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I even thought that my skin would not be smooth again as I had seen others who faced a similar problem
    <br>and they died or their face was condemned.
    <br>To God be the glory, through the Morning Water, the skin on my face became normal.
    <br>I am here now; I am a living testimony!
    <br>I even left my beard to grow because I never thought I would grow a beard again.
    <br>You said what? Please repeat what you said.
    <br>I even left my beard to grow because I never thought I would grow a beard again.
    <br>Put your hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>Indeed, we can imagine! How can a beard grown again on a burnt face? - By no means.
    <br>Sir, we want to ask you one more question:
    <br>If not for the medium of the Morning Water, what do you think would have happened to your face
    <br>that we are seeing glowing now?
    <br>I would have had to undergo plastic surgery.
    <br>But to God be the glory, what happened to your face?
    <br>I thank God so much that I'm okay now and strong. Even my hand that was burnt is okay now.
    <br>Everything is completely restored?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>To God be the glory. Let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>What can you now say about this powerful medium of the Morning Water that God Almighty has used
    <br>to restore your skin and to replace it to its original position?
    <br>I used to tell people that God sent the Morning Water through Prophet T.B. Joshua for us to use.
    <br>The Morning Water is something I even find difficult to explain.
    <br>There was a boy who was brought to my house in Libya with stomach pain.
    <br>He couldn't eat; he would immediately vomit anything that entered his mouth.
    <br>But when I ministered the Morning Water to him, he immediately ate biscuits and took a drink.
    <br>Within a small time, he asked for rice - and this was a boy who couldn't eat for three days.
    <br>Anything he put into his mouth before, he would vomit it immediately.
    <br>So, the Morning Water is a great thing God Almighty sent to us through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>To God be the glory! We know we are blessed.
    <br>What advice do you now have for the viewers watching you and those listening to you right now?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My advice to viewers, especially those who are watching me in Libya -
    <br>on Sundays we don't have to go to work in Libya and always worship with Emmanuel TV -
    <br>my advice is to believe in God because with Him, all things are possible.
    <br>I did not believe before that I would be like this today but through Emmanuel TV and the Morning Water,
    <br>I am a living testimony today; I thank God.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can you please touch your face for the last time?
    <br>You said you were unable to touch your face before.
    <br>Can you please touch your face and tell us if you are still feeling any pain?
    <br>Nothing. No pain. Now I am okay.
    <br>Are you feeling any pain?
    <br>Nothing. I'm alright.
    <br>Everything is fresh?
    <br>Everything is fresh.
    <br>Wholesome, for the glory of God.
    <br>Put your hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this wonderful testimony you have shared with us.
    <br>We believe this has really encouraged us and has lifted up our faith in Christ Jesus.
    <br>We want to encourage you that now that you have been set free, healed for the glory of God,
    <br>continue to live your life to please Jesus Christ, and we pray that He would give you the grace to
    <br>maintain this wonderful healing, in Jesus' mighty name.
