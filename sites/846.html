    <br>SOUTH KOREA CRUSADE WITH T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Testimony continues
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Kim Jae Sik - 69 years old
    <br>Kim Jae Sik - Seoul, South Korea
    <br>My name is Kim Jae Sik. I am 69 years old.
    <br>I am from Seoul, South Korea.
    <br>Who is the woman next to you?
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>I came to meet Prophet T.B. Joshua because I had heart pain.
    <br>I came to this Crusade because of my heart and respiratory problem.
    <br>For how long did you have this problem?
    <br>I suffered from this problem for 20 years.
    <br>I couldn't do anything; so, my wife suffered because she always had to work hard.
    <br>If I didn't use the breathing machine, I could not breathe.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I removed the oxygen mask.
    <br>Now, I can move freely.
    <br>I couldn't breathe on my own. I had to use a respirator and oxygen bottle to breathe.
    <br>After the prayer, I disconnected it.
    <br>I went to many hospitals.
    <br>I went to prayer mountains.
    <br>I went to many different places in search of a solution.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I removed the oxygen machine
    <br>and now I can breathe freely.
    <br>Before, I used to visit several hospitals and also prayer mountains.
    <br>But the solution was only in the Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Why were you using an oxygen machine?
    <br>I couldn't breathe, so I had to use the oxygen machine to breathe.
    <br>What happened when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you?
    <br>My heart became light and I felt like running. So, I did.
    <br>I felt very fresh in my heart and suddenly I felt that I could walk and run now.
    <br>After removing the breathing machine, I can now move around, breathe, talk and walk freely.
    <br>I feel now very good because before, I used to use an oxygen machine
    <br>but that was very uncomfortable.
    <br>But now I don't use this so I can freely live my daily life.
    <br>What are the things you can do now to confirm that you are healed?
    <br>Before, I couldn't walk properly but now, I can walk freely and I am fine.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Yes, now I can run and do push ups.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Mr. Kim jumps up to the glory of God and demonstrates how he can now move freely,
    <br>and even do push ups pain-free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Before, I was not able to do these things but now, I am very able to do this.
    <br>I can breathe freely after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.
    <br>So, I can testify that you too will be healed if Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I want to tell you that I am healed by God who worked through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So, I want to tell you that you will also be healed if you get prayed for by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>God is working through him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Jeong Jin Hui - Seoul, South Korea
    <br>My name is Jeong Jin Hui. I am 53 years old.
    <br>I am from Seoul, South Korea.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>He had a heart problem and had an operation.
    <br>He was in the hospital and couldn't breathe without a breathing machine.
    <br>This was why we came to the Crusade.
    <br>My husband had a heart surgery,
    <br>and he couldn't breathe well without a respirator and oxygen bottles.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I felt bad seeing him not able to breathe.
    <br>I felt very sad to just look at him being sick and having a problem with his heart.
    <br>How do you feel after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for your husband?
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>How do you feel when you see your husband breathing without any devices - respirator and oxygen bottle?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I want my husband to stay healthy and spread the Gospel.
    <br>I am very thankful to Jesus Christ, and I want my husband to live for spreading the Gospel.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus! Thank You for healing my husband.
    <br>I really want everyone to encounter Jesus Christ.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Climbing up the winding staircase, it is difficult to believe
    <br>that Mr. Kim was once confined to a wheelchair
    <br>and unable to breathe without an oxygen machine.
    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>A group of visitors from Singapore who attended the crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>recognise Mr. Kim and rejoice with him,
    <br>giving thanks to God for his miraculous healing.
    <br>They share their experience as they remember the deplorable condition
    <br>in which Mr. Kim came to the crusade.
    <br>I am Mathew Ng from Singapore.
    <br>I am now meeting this gentleman who we first met during the crusade.
    <br>When we met him, he was very ill and we remember seeing him with tubes
    <br>all over his hands and body.
    <br>He was in a wheelchair and even used an oxygen tank.
    <br>Now, we are looking at him totally restored and healed
    <br>by the mighty power of the Lord, Jesus Christ, through Prophet T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN.
    <br>I'm just so happy!
