    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you believe that God will manifest His strength in your weakness?
    <br>Let me see your hand if you believe that.
    <br>Once we believe this, you will not have a reason to condemn yourself.
    <br>No condemnation for you.
    <br>Do you know what weakness means? Weakness can be anything.
    <br>This is what Apostle Paul says,
    <br>"When I am weak, then  I am strong".
    <br>Now you believe that, now what else again?
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>Imagine you left your country, on a two to three day journey and at last you are here
    <br>and you are still thinking of your weakness again.
    <br>"Because I am a smoker, God will not answer me."
    <br>"Because I am a drunkard, God will not answer me."
    <br>"Because of this, God will not answer me."
    <br>If you had not been prepared in advance, you would not come here.
    <br>The Lord, God has prepared you.
    <br>No one comes to Jesus without preparation.
    <br>This is what the Bible says, "No one can say, Jesus is Lord, except by the preparation of the Holy Ghost".
    <br>He must prepare you, He must make you to believe.
    <br>He must coach you.
    <br>He is not a real man. God is Spirit and His worshipper must be spirit as well.
    <br>If you know what takes you to be here, it's not just one day you think of this place.
    <br>For many years, you were planning to be here, and you keep failing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Those whom the Lord prepared, stay with the Lord.
    <br>When the Lord prepares you to go to a place, you will not want to let people know
    <br>because of discouragement.
    <br>It's like fasting - when God prepares you to fast, you must go and fast because God is final.
    <br>God prepared you in advance to be here.
    <br>The very moment you thought of coming here, you started having nightmares.
    <br>An attack!
    <br>The attack will speed up.
    <br>You will say, "Ah! What is wrong?"
    <br>If the Lord had not prepared you to be here, with those attacks, discouragements, negative words,
    <br>with that what you have seen and all other.
    <br>Even to get money, flight ticket - you would not be here.
    <br>Those whom the Lord prepares are those whom He saves and protects.
    <br>If the Lord has prepared you in advance to here, first,
    <br>He is ready to manifest His strength in your weakness.
    <br>Where you are weak, you are strong, that is the first thing.
    <br>That is God's preparation.
    <br>When you see someone being here, saying, "No, I don't want them to touch me" -
    <br>the Lord has not prepared them.
    <br>If you had been prepared to be here, the Lord would manifest His strength in your weakness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the first thing.
    <br>So this is why I'm asking you, "Are you ready?"
    <br>So that is it.
    <br>When you are weak, you are strong.
    <br>Thank you. Thank you, viewers at home. Did you liisten to what we are saying here?
    <br>For those the Lord had prepared, He manifested His strength in their weakness.
    <br>Whatever area of your weakness, that is the concern of God.
    <br>Leave it for God.
    <br>It is not about your weakness, success, healing.
    <br>It's not about your weakness, deliverance.
    <br>"I'm a smoker, He will not heal me." - No!
    <br>"I am a drunkard, He will not heal me." - No!
    <br>It's not about your weakness.
    <br>Healing is not about your weakness; deliverance is not about your weakness.
    <br>Now, you have no excuse - it is your availability.
    <br>Are you available?
    <br>I am available, here I am!
    <br>Say to the Lord, "Here I am!"
    <br>That's is all.
    <br>Here I am, Lord, I am available.
    <br>Whatever your weakness, "Here I am!"
    <br>He made you fit at the cross.
    <br>Here I am, Lord.
    <br>Whatever you are, "Here I am!"
    <br>He is God of creation.
    <br>Your weaknesses - whatever you think is a barrier is not a barrier; just say, "Here I am!"
    <br>It is not about your weakness;
    <br>be available, be ready.
    <br>Here I am, change me.
    <br>Here I am, save me.
    <br>Here I am, heal me.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>That should your prayer.  When you sit down, say, "Here I am; heal me."  Forget about anything.
    <br>Where you are coming from does not matter.
    <br>Here I am; heal me. Here I am; save me. Here I am; bless me.
    <br>Forget about, "I'm a smoker, I'm this and that."
    <br>If that spirit of smoking had so much influence and power on you, it would not allow you to come here.
    <br>Its influence has cut since you entered.
    <br>You are here by God's invitation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are here by God's invitation.
    <br>You are here by His invitation.
    <br>If you are not qualified, you will not receive. You have received the invitation. That is why you are here.
    <br>Begin to talk in your spirit, "Here I am, Lord".
    <br>Forget about whatever you are, whatever your weakness.
    <br>Whatever your weakness, forget about that.
    <br>Whatever you think, "I am not going to make it" - no, put it behind.
    <br>Here I am. bless me. Here I am; save me.  Here I am; heal me. Here I am; deliver me.
    <br>"Here I am" - this is all He wants to hear from you.
    <br>You must be sincere. You must say this with all your heart. You must mean it, what you are saying.
    <br>Mean it with all your heart.
    <br>Here I am, Lord; save me. Here I am; bless me. Here I am; deliver me.
    <br>Simple; this is all Jesus wants from you.
    <br>Whatever your background - whether you are from idol worshipping, or whether you are not a believer -
    <br>that is not the issue.
    <br>Begin to fire on! Mean it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If the Lord wants somebody - "Here I am."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know that you are available.
    <br>You are fit, that is why you are under the influence of this telecast.
    <br>You are qualified, that is why you are under the influence of this telecast.
    <br>Ordinarily, it is not possible for you to sit down, be watching Emmanuel TV and abandon every other thing.
    <br>If you are not qualified, you cannot watch.
    <br>You are watching Emmanuel TV by God's invitation.
    <br>Begin to fire on in your spirit - "Here I am, Lord."
    <br>Here I am, Lord; heal me. Here I am; save me. Here I am; bless me, Lord. Here I am; deliver me.
    <br>This is what Jesus wants to hear from you.
    <br>Whatever you weakness, whatever the barrier,
    <br>whatever you think can be the obstacle to your blessing - put it behind you.
    <br>Don't forget: "Forgive them" - this includes you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, in Jesus' name.
