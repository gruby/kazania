  <p>    
    <br>Last meeting, I shared with you one of my habits.
    <br>I am going to share with you, today, one more.
    <br>Let us move over there.
    <br>My viewers, you deserve what I deserve - this is revelation.
    <br>In the morning, you take a cup of hot water and two lemons.
    <br>Cut them into small slices and put in the cup.
    <br>After three to five minutes, begin to sip it as a drink.
    <br>Refill it three times.
    <br>I will not mind doing it in the exact way.
    <br>I'm going to cut it.

    <br>This is hot water.

    <br>I would advise you to walk around your compound or premises as you are sipping.
    <br>After three to five minutes, sip it as a drink.

    <br>When you are moving and sipping, it helps digestion.
    <br>Refill it three times.
    <br>To show you how effective this is, look at me before.
    <br>And now, look at me!
    <br>Imagine what has been flushed out!
    <br>Irrespective of what is in your system, it will be flushed out!
    <br>I would advise you, while sipping it as a drink, to move around with it.
    <br>As I have said, it helps digestion - moving around with it.
    <br>If you are not fit enough, sip it and move around with it.
    <br>For those of us that are fit enough, you can still do press ups
    <br>when you wake up in the morning.
    <br>This is my habit. I am going to demonstrate it.
    <br>How to lose weight naturally - TB Joshua
    <br>This is it!
    <br>So, if you are fit, you are advised to do press ups.
    <br>It energises your system.
    <br>Thank you, viewers, for your time.
