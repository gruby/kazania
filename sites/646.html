  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your time has been blessed!
    <br>That is Jesus for you.
    <br>Jesus desires to heal our wounds.
    <br>He desires to heal our wounds.
    <br>When I say 'wounds', I mean everything about you.
    <br>You need healing, deliverance, ‎blessing - just name it.
    <br>He desires to heal your wounds, that is, to free you.‎
    <br>But often we do not permit Him -
    <br>often we do not allow Him. ‎
    <br>It is not something where He can just come by Himself without your faith,
    <br>"Be healed, be delivered!"
    <br>No, it is not ‎possible.
    <br>He can’t just come and say, "Hey, are you sick? Be healed!"
    <br>No! He needs your attention.
    <br>The road ‎to that is not the easiest road.
    <br>There is anointing just everywhere -
    <br>more than enough.
    <br>Now, it is time for you to use your faith to put a demand on the anointing.
    <br>Your faith now!
    <br>The supply is more than the demand.
    <br>When just one person is demanding for something, "Oh, it is too much for me".
    <br>That is just it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us quickly take a look at the book of Luke 17.‎
    <br>"Jesus said to His disciples: 'Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come...'"
    <br>It is a text you must read every second.
    <br>When you get home, just read it. When you read it, it will guide you.
    <br>All these little irritations that overwhelm you, what people say about you, what people do to you.
    <br>When you know this verse, it will continue to help you.
    <br>Jesus said to you.
    <br>You put your name where the message is personal.
    <br>Jesus said to me.
    <br>Read along with me. One, two, three.
    <br>Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎
    <br>Can we read it together again.
    <br>Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎
    <br>Anytime you read the Bible, insert your name where the message is personal.
    <br>In this case, it is personal.
    <br>"Jesus said to His disciples" - you remove 'disciples' and insert your own name.
    <br>Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎
    <br>If Jesus said this to you, what else again? What are you talking about?
    <br>What are you talking about?
    <br>This means, it is impossible to live this life without offence.
    <br>I like that.
    <br>Can you write it down! Because I know you’re a professor, you’re very educated.
    <br>This word is not something ‎you can put in your memory: It must go in your heart.‎
    <br>Write it on your paper.
    <br>I know you are a professor, you are very educated,
    <br>and the one who is talking to ‎you was your student ‎‏in the past:
    <br>"Ha! T.B. Joshua was my student. I taught him when he was in primary school."
    <br>Ok, sit down there.‎‏
    <br>Take your paper and write something down as it will help you.
    <br>It will help you.
    <br>We read it again before we proceed.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>That is Luke 17:1.
    <br>Jesus said to me: Things that will cause me to ‎stumble are bound to come.‎
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>It means that it is impossible for me, T.B. Joshua, to live this life without offence.‎
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>It is impossible for you to live among people without offence.
    <br>Offence can come in any way, whether you are wrong or right. ‎
    <br>I saw you when you were dancing - you had forgotten about offence.
    <br>That is why you were dancing like this.
    <br>I said, "Ah, see my sister, see my brother!"
    <br>Some people were dancing like this.
    <br>After you finished dancing - "Hm, I will deal with that sister!"
    <br>I know you.
    <br>I was laughing.
    <br>Some people were dancing like this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I said, "Hey! Jesus, thank You!"
    <br>But after you finished dancing, you sat down like this.
    <br>"I will deal with him!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But now that we are talking, you have forgotten about that.
    <br>I want you to forget all trouble forever.
    <br>This is the wall between you and your ‎salvation,
    <br>the wall between you and God.
    <br>A good Christian, a real Christian, should refuse to be offended in order not to offend ‎God.  ‎
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>A real Christian, a good Christian, a true Christian, should refuse to be offended
    <br>in order not to offend ‎God.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: REFUSE TO BE OFFENDED
    <br>Where will you put offence? Is that not where God lives?
    <br>There is no other place - in the heart.‎
    <br>Where will you put offence? Where the Holy Spirit lives.
    <br>There is no other place where you can ‎put offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we feel offended, we use our tongues out of bitterness, hatred and anger
    <br>to crush a close friendship,
    <br>to split our churches,
    <br>to shatter our marriages,
    <br>to crumble families and tear them apart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The people most offended are the people that were cheated.
    <br>It is when you are cheated, you get ‎offended.
    <br>The right people, good people, Christians are the ones.
    <br>The good people are being cheated and embarassed.
    <br>When we feel offended, we do not know that we are trapped.
    <br>That is when you begin to say, "I will deal with him. Ok, I have already dealt with him".
    <br>You do not know that you are trapped.
    <br>Offence is an instrument used by satan to ‎blind us on the reality.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are offended, you see yourself concentrate and focus on the wrong done to ‎you,
    <br>forgetting the condition you are in.‎
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Ah, why me? This is an insult! I can't believe it!"
    <br>"Why all this? Why now?"
    <br>Whereas he has cancer - he is no longer talking about the cancer in his body.
    <br>"Oh, why all this? Why? What can I do?"
    <br>"No! I trained him. I was the one who trained him from school and now he is a graduate."
    <br>"Now he has become rich. But when he first ‎came, he was living with me."
    <br>"I hosted him. I trained him. I sent him to London. Look at him, ‎he is a nice man."
    <br>Whereas he has diabetes - he is no longer talking about that.
    <br>He is talking about the wrong done to him. ‎
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Offence is very rampant due to lack of real love.
    <br>Due to what? [Real love!]
    <br>There is love and there is real love.
    <br>I mean, genuine love.
    <br>Real love forgets wrong so that there is hope for the future.‎
    <br>What is real love?
    <br>Real love forgets wrong.
    <br>Say to your neighbour.
    <br>Real love forgets wrong!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Real love forgets wrong!
    <br>So that there is what?
    <br>So that there is hope for the future.
    <br>Real love ‎forgets wrong so that there is hope for the future. ‎
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎
    <br>Tell your neighbor again.
    <br>To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.‎
    <br>Do you know what I mean by getting out of your dry pit?
    <br>Your dry pit could be sickness,
    <br>your dry pit could be isolation,
    <br>your dry pit could be ‎poverty, hardship.
    <br>What is your dry pit? ‎
    <br>To get out of your dry pit, you must let go of offence.
    <br>Whether you are wrong or right, no ‎one is permitted to hold on to an offence. ‎
    <br>Now you have received but don’t forget that to maintain this blessing, you need God.
    <br>Like my Evangelist said:
    <br>"The best man in the world can only maintain unless God protects."
    <br>It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall. ‎
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.
    <br>This is your case.
    <br>It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.
    <br>You desire healing, you desire blessing.
    <br>He who desires victory must be ready for war.
    <br>You desire blessing, victory, protection, salvation, all of God’s ‎blessings.
    <br>He who desires victory must be ready for war.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take it once again.
    <br>The best man in the world can only maintain unless God protects. ‎
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour: What will you do with this little counsel?‎
    <br>What will you do with this little counsel?‎
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>What will you do with this little counsel?‎
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>What will you do with this little counsel?‎
    <br>Will you ask your neighbour a simple question?
    <br>What will you do with this little counsel?‎
    <br>That is it.
    <br>To maintain, you need God.
    <br>It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.
    <br>What will you do with this counsel?
    <br>You have heard that a good Christian should refuse to be ‎offended.‎
    <br>A good Christian should refuse to be offended because you don’t want to offend God.
    <br>The ‎reason why you have to refuse to be offended is because you don’t want to offend God. ‎
    <br>You can't hold offence and talk to God.
    <br>You can't hold offence and hear from God.
    <br>‎It is not possible.‎
    <br>Because when you hold offence, your spirit is not free
    <br>and your spirit needs to be free to ‎contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>When you hold an offence, your spirit is in bondage.
    <br>Your ‎spirit needs to be free to be sensitive to the Spirit of God. ‎
    <br>Just like the little example I gave you:
    <br>When you hold an offence, seeing yourself focus and ‎concentrate on the wrong done to you,
    <br>forgetting the condition in which you are.
    <br>It is not possible to talk about two things.
    <br>You can't be talking about failure and at the ‎same time talking about success.
    <br>Once you are focusing and concentrating on the wrong done to you,
    <br>the condition in ‎which you are is silent.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>With all your heart, you have to receive.
    <br>When you talk with all your heart, the job is ‎half done.
    <br>When we start praying now and you begin to confess with all your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>You have scored fifty percent. ‎
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>I want to repeat again.
    <br>When we say, "Okay, it is time to pray", and you begin to talk with all your ‎heart,
    <br>at that level, you have scored fifty percent, the job is half done. ‎
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But how will you talk with all your heart when your heart is not free -
    <br>when you find ‎yourself a hostage, in self-imprisonment because of an unforgiving spirit?
    <br>You are carrying ‎anger, hatred, bitterness against someone. ‎
    <br>You are here in the presence of God, carrying an unforgiving spirit,
    <br>carrying hatred, bitterness, jealousy against someone somewhere,
    <br>and you want to receive from God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God has already judged those who have offended you.
    <br>It is in that book when you read down: "Woe unto..."
    <br>Take your book and read.
    <br>He has judged already.
    <br>So, if God has laid judgment on those ‎who have offended you, why do you want to hassle?‎
    <br>It is there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He said: "''...but woe to anyone through whom they come.'"
    <br>"Jesus said to His disciples: 'Things that cause ‎people to stumble are bound to come
    <br>but woe to anyone through whom they come.'"
    <br>What judgment again?
    <br>It is clear.‎
    <br>Below, the punishment has already been described there.
    <br>It is there when you read it ‎down. ‎
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you free?
    <br>Are you free now?
    <br>Before now, we were carrying anger, bitterness, hurt, deep ‎pain, deep hurt against someone.
    <br>Make sure that you are free now so that we can proceed.
    <br>Because we are about to enter ‎another level. ‎
    <br>You know when a pilot is flying, he will tell you he is going up - above the level he is now.
    <br>We are going up now.
    <br>Whatever you need to do now; please, get yourself free.
    <br>You ‎need to be free.
    <br>It makes the job easier.
    <br>To be free is fifty percent.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can open your lips and say, "Lord Jesus, come into my heart, wash me with your ‎precious blood". Prayer!
    <br>Viewers all over the world!
    <br>We need to be free to contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>If your spirit ‎is not free, you cannot contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>Right now, say a simple prayer.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart, wash ‎me with your precious blood, save my soul today.
    <br>Prayer, viewers!
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart, wash ‎me with your precious blood, save my soul today.
    <br>Viewers, I need to say the reason because I have not talked to you yet.
    <br>Listen - this is a message to you:
    <br>As a good Christian, ‎you should refuse to be offended in order not to offend Jesus.
    <br>It is true! Jesus said to you that it is not possible to live in this world without offence.
    <br>But in ‎order not to offend God, you should refuse to be offended.
    <br>So please open your lips right ‎now and say this word: "Lord Jesus!"
    <br>You know that I am not calling you a sinner.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart!
    <br>Wash me ‎with your precious blood!
    <br>Save my soul today!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers, listen to me!
    <br>When we feel offended, we begin to use our tongues out of bitterness and ‎anger.
    <br>We begin to use our tongues to split relationships, shatter marriages ‎and tear families apart.
    <br>We split the ministry, churches with our tongues.
    <br>In the tongue, death ‎and life, as the Book of Proverbs 18:21 says.
    <br>‎Right now, say: Lord Jesus, come into my heart,
    <br>wash me with your precious blood,
    <br>save my soul today!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Into my heart
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>Come in to stay
    <br>Come in today
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>Into my heart
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>Come in to stay
    <br>Come in today
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>Into my heart
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>Come in to stay
    <br>Come in today
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>Into my heart
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>Come in to stay
    <br>Come in today
    <br>Come into my heart, Lord Jesus
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Like I asked you - what is your dry pit?
    <br>When Joseph was in the dry pit, he said to himself, "This is not where I belong".
    <br>‎He was in the dry pit where there was no light, there was nothing.
    <br>He was there, saying to ‎himself what was in accordance with his dream and goal.
    <br>He had dreamt.
    <br>He knew what the vision was all ‎about for him.
    <br>He said to himself, "This is not where I belong. I know where I belong".
    <br>That statement comforted him.
    <br>You are supposed to be comforted ‎if you have a vision.
    <br>When we ‎‏say 'a poor man', it does not mean a man without money in the pocket but a man ‎without vision.
    <br>‎‏Whatever situation you are in, remember your dream and your goal.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, remember your dream and your goal!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Whatever ‎‏situation you are in, remember your dream and your goal! ‎‏
    <br>When Joseph was in the dry pit, he said to himself, after remembering his dream and goal,
    <br>"This is ‎not ‎‏where I belong. I know where I belong!"
    <br>He laughed and said, "Ok, ok, ok! This is one of ‎‏the ten I will pass through to get to where I'm going".
    <br>Have you ever said to yourself before, standing in the face of storm and crisis,
    <br>"Hey, this is not where I belong. My dream does not suggest these.
    <br>This is not ‎where I belong! I ‎‏know where I belong!
    <br>Ok, just a stop-over. It is one of the states I must pass through.
    <br>It will not impair me but improve me!"
    <br>Your struggle will make you stronger.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whoever asked yourself this?
    <br>But you never remember.
    <br>I mean, if you have a vision in your ‎dream, you ‎‏will remember.
    <br>Instead of lamenting, mourning, complaining, "Oh my God, ‎why this trouble?"
    <br>No! Remember your ‎goal and your dream whatever ‎‏the situation.
    <br>Joseph was in the dry pit and immediately that ‎situation reminded him of his dream and goal.
    <br>He said to himself, "Ah, I dreamt seeing a crown. I dreamt ‎wearing a crown.
    <br>I dreamt seeing myself on a throne.‏
    <br>This is not a throne. This is not where I ‎belong; I know where I belong!"
    <br>I know where I belong means, "Yes, I'm still going there!"
    <br>I know where I belong means, "Here ‎will ‎‏make me stronger!"
    <br>I know where I belong means, "This place will not impair me but improve me!"
    <br>Do you ever talk to yourself like that?
    <br>Each time you have no money, you begin to complain.
    <br>Each time there are challenges, you ‎begin to ‎‏complain.
    <br>‎‏You allow your situation to rule you.
    <br>You allow your situation to ‎dictate your direction.
    <br>Don't allow your situtation to rule you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "I know where I belong."
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>If you know where you belong, why are you complaining, murmuring?
    <br>Why are you lamenting over the ‎situation ‎you are in?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why? Ask yourself.
    <br>If you know where you belong, that alone can give you joy and strength -
    <br>so much ‎strength to overlook the situation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I say to you: He who desires victory must be ready for war.
    <br>So it is part of your war you ‎must ‎fight.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Cancer can be part of the war.
    <br>Fever, setback, hardship, poverty, ‎‎disappointment
    <br>can be one of the ones you must fight to get to the throne.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: He who desires victory must be ready for ‎‎war.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we say war, you may fight twenty wars to get to the throne, and you must ‎overcome each war.
    <br>If not, it ‎will give you setback.
    <br>You may fight twenty wars.
    <br>The ‎number of wars you fight may not be the number of wars I will fight.
    <br>You may fight twenty; I may fight hundred.
    <br>The nature of war you fight may not be the nature of war I ‎fight.
    <br>Yours can be ‎disappointment, hardship, people lying against you, going into prison and coming back.
    <br>It could be isolation, sickness, disease or affliction.
    <br>It could be that war you need to fight to get to the throne.
    <br>He who desires victory, he who desires a crown, he who desires to be in a palace
    <br>must be ‎ready to fight war.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour: What is your present war now?
    <br>He should answer you; you should answer her.
    <br>What is your present war?
    <br>Answer your neighbour.
    <br>What is your present war?
    <br>Yours could be ‎disappointment, setback, hardship, hatred.
    <br>What is your present war?
    <br>Nothing comes for nothing and nothing happens by chance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Joseph found himself ‎in the dry pit as a ‎part of the war he had to fight.
    <br>He fought it, overcame and moved forward.
    <br>From that dry pit - the pit was not the last war.
    <br>He still went ahead to fight.
    <br>The dry pit was not the last war Joseph fought to get to the throne.
    <br>Are you saying the dry pit was the last war?
    <br>No!
    <br>Why are you troubled and crying?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The dry pit was not the last war.
    <br>That was why he said, "I know where I belong! This is ‎not where I belong. I know where I ‎belong".
    <br>He knew he had more battles to fight.
    <br>But in each ‎war, each battle, he remembered his goal, his vision.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Remember your vision!"
    <br>Remember your vision.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Remember your vision.
    <br>Nothing is much more than your vision.
    <br>Nothing is much more ‎than your goal.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Nothing is much more ‎than your goal.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Nothing is much more ‎than your goal.
    <br>Nothing is much more ‎than your vision and your ‎goal.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.
    <br>Thank you. You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can anybody that listened to that message still be complaining over the situation
    <br>when you know where ‎you belong!
    <br>You will soon leave that situation, the situation will soon leave ‎you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>That is it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will leave the situation ‎and the situation will leave you.
    <br>You know ‎where you belong!
    <br>That is not where you belong.
    <br>Soldier on!
    <br>You will meet another situation after this.
    <br>You ‎will meet another ‎situation probably greater than the one you are facing now.
    <br>It determines the type of crown you are prepared for.
    <br>A greater crown ‎attracts greater persecution.
    <br>So, that is it.
    <br>You are talking as if this is the last war you will fight to get to the palace.
    <br>This is the way you talk now - as if you are fed up.
    <br>"This is the last battle" - I don't know whether this is the last battle you will fight to get to the palace,
    <br>to get to your destination.
    <br>Many of us don’t know what it means to say, "Joseph was in the dry pit".
    <br>That pit was ‎not the last battle. ‎
    <br>He left the dry pit and then soldiered on to another battle, ‎another greater situation.
    <br>We that maintain the relationship with God are enabled.
    <br>Anybody that maintains the relationship - if today you say, "I want to be a friend of God.
    <br>I want to be with God" - you will be enabled to endure.
    <br>There is a grace.
    <br>It maintains the ‎relationship.
    <br>If you confess genuinely and follow Him - not just like people ‎that confess, "Jesus is my Lord" -
    <br>there is a package for you.
    <br>No one follows Jesus without enablement.
    <br>The test and hardship that confront your daily life - there is enablement.
    <br>Enablement means strength, ability.
    <br>He doesn't leave us ‎just like that.
    <br>He has giving each and ‎everyone enablement.
    <br>Why should we complain?
    <br>When you follow Him, He gives you enablement.
    <br>You can't just follow Him without enablement.
    <br>That enablement is to give you endurance and ‎overcoming.
    <br>So ‎when you see people complaining, it means they are not genuinely born again.
    <br>If you are ‎genuinely ‎born again, there is enablement given to you -
    <br>that is ability, strength, given to ‎you to be His children
    <br>and that ‎enablement will give you endurance.
    <br>That enablement ‎will give you power to overcome.
    <br>It was that ‎enablement that gave Joseph endurance, ‎to endure the situation in the dry pit.
    <br>If not, he would have died there, not enduring the situation in the dry pit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are living and talking as if the life you live is yours.
    <br>Once you are born again, the ‎life you are living is ‎not yours but Christ's.
    <br>It means that when you are born again, you follow ‎Christ.
    <br>It means that someone is somewhere seeing ‎you through.
    <br>Someone is somewhere fighting for you.
    <br>Someone is somewhere protecting you.
    <br>You may not see it but He is somewhere seeing you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you be bold enough to say, "I know where I belong!"
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>Do you know the meaning?
    <br>It means that the situation you are in now, is not yours.
    <br>You will soon get out of that and move forward.
    <br>Say to yourself, "I know where I belong".
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>Where you belong - that is ‎the question.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So ‎please, you need to talk to yourself.
    <br>Talking to yourself is better ‎than even a pastor talking to you.
    <br>You are not used to talking to yourself.
    <br>I am talking to you but if you ‎talk to yourself with all your heart,
    <br>it is more powerful ‎than a pastor talking to you.
    <br>You need ‎to talk to yourself.
    <br>When you get home today, you need to ‎meditate over and over the message you received today.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
