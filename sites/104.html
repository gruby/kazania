    104 - Worry About Tomorrow - T.B. Joshua
  </h3>
  <p>    
    <br>Jesus begins by saying, "Let not your heart be troubled."
    <br>The Lord is not saying here that we lack reason to be troubled;
    <br>what He is really saying is that there is greater reason not to be.
    <br>We can all acknowledge that life is filled with trouble.
    <br>This is why the Book of Job 5:7 says that man is born into trouble.
    <br>From the moment you leave your mother's womb, you encounter trouble.
    <br>Life begins with a doctor's slap on our backside.
    <br>We all face almost daily disappointments.
    <br>We want to be strong but we find ourselves weak.
    <br>We want to be courageous but we feel overcome by fear.
    <br>We want to be successful but we fail repeatedly.
    <br>We want to be loved but people seem indifferent to us.
    <br>The better a man is, the worse he is thought of by his rivals.
    <br>Everything good in you is the cause of envy
    <br>and the effect, result and consequence of envy is everything bad.
    <br>The cause of killing, stealing and destruction is the urge to store up wealth here on earth.
    <br>Worry About Tomorrow - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Worrying about the future destroys our sense of judgement.
    <br>When you worry about tomorrow and future, you cripple your ability to think, act and exercise faith in the present.
    <br>When we are anxious about tomorrow,
    <br>we will not be able to differentiate between God's supplies and satan's bait.
    <br>Today's trouble is enough for today.
    <br>God is aware of our challenges and he prepares us for each day's challenges.
    <br>If you are a follower of Him, a believer, you will use today's supplies and let tomorrow be.
    <br>Use today's supplies and let next be.
    <br>No matter the message or what is happening around you,
    <br>don't be agitated, stressed out and thrown into confusion.
