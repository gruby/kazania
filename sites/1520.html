  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we know different positions -
    <br>we have people watching us right now on the sickbed, in the prison.
    <br>Wherever you are, the position of your heart matters.
    <br>What is the position of your heart?
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be ready to forgive.
    <br>"Forgive us as we forgive."
    <br>Forgive - you will be forgiven!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Release from poverty, release from affliction, release from setback, release from stagnation!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Be released from that bed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released from that affliction, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Give thanks to God for your release.
    <br>Give thanks to God for your freedom.
    <br>Every damaged organ, every damaged system - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Worship Him.
