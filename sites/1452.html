    <br>Testimony Continues

    <br>Pedro González & Family
    <br>Paraguay
    <br>He said that his name is Pedro Gonzaléz
    <br>and the person sitting next to him is his wife Elida and also his daughter Cecilia
    <br>and they come from Paraguay.
    <br>We came to share the testimony of my wife's healing.
    <br>She was sick and suffered for ten years.
    <br>She had discal hernia and cysts.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>For ten years, we suffered a lot because she had severe pain and could not even sit up.
    <br>We could not go anywhere. She could not even sit at the table with us.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The doctor said that she had to undergo surgery.
    <br>It was risky because she could end up with a wheelchair.
    <br>We decided not to do it because we were waiting for God's intervention.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>It really affected me because for more than ten years, my wife was bedridden.
    <br>It was a difficult situation because we had to look after our children and grandchildren.
    <br>She couldn't spend time with us; when we were eating at the table, she was in bed.
    <br>This made us sad.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>We got to know about the crusade through an advertisement on TV.
    <br>We made preparations to come because we believed that God was going to heal my wife
    <br>through the man of God.
    <br>That was the reason we came.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>That day, I was worried about her because she was always lying on a mattress in pain.
    <br>I cannot explain how I felt that day because I was desperate.
    <br>But I thank God that the man of God located us.
    <br>Finally, when he touched her, she received her healing and stood up without pain.
    <br>We are sharing this testimony because of the great thing the Lord has done.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The change is radical because she is normal again.
    <br>Now she is happy and has even gone back to work.
    <br>Now she is strong and can sit up and even walk, unlike before.
    <br>That is why we are rejoicing so much.

    <br>Elida Beatriz González & Family
    <br>Paraguay
    <br>She said her name is Elida González and she comes from Paraguay
    <br>and the man beside her is her husband and this is her daughter Cecilia.
    <br>I had a discernal hernia and two cysts in my spine which led to an excruciating pain for ten years.
    <br>I could neither sit, stand nor walk because of the excruciating pain.
    <br>The way I sit now - I couldn't sit like that before.
    <br>I was confined to the bed.
    <br>I could only lie in bed without turning.
    <br>The pain I felt made me feel very uncomfortable.
    <br>My whole body was in pain.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The doctors told me that I had to do a surgery
    <br>but that there was a risk I could end up in a wheelchair.
    <br>Even all the medication I had to take could not relieve me of the pain.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Seeing my family together while I was alone made me sad.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>We heard about the crusade through an advert on TV.
    <br>My husband and I made preparations for the crusade.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I was carried to the crusade on a mattress because of the pain.
    <br>The man of God came close to me and prayed for me.
    <br>When he told me to stand up, I stood up without pain, in Jesus' name. 
    <br>I am very happy and grateful to God for the miracle He has done in my life and family.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>There are many changes in my life, especially now.
    <br>You can see the way I am sitting freely without pain.
    <br>I can walk freely. I feel like a newborn baby!
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I advise that you trust in God because there is nothing impossible for Him.
    <br>In one second, I stood up and walked without pain.
    <br>I joyfully share my testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Cecilia González & Family
    <br>Paraguay
    <br>She said that her name is Cecilia González, these are her parents and they come from Paraguay.
    <br>This affected our lives because she could not do anything at home.
    <br>As young as we were, we had to help my father do everything -
    <br>preparing food, washing clothes, ironing and cleaning the house.
    <br>It was so painful seeing her lying in bed.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>As a family, we gave her several treatments but all failed.
    <br>We did everything as instructed by the doctors but she was still the same.
    <br>The treatment could not help her but now, you can see her sitting freely.
    <br>We should have faith because God exists and He is alive.
    <br>God is powerful!
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>As you can see, I can stand up.
    <br>Before, I could not do this but now I can sit down without any problem or pain.
    <br>I can stand up, walk and move my body.
    <br>I can do movements I couldn't do before; I am moving to the glory of God.
    <br>For the miracle God has done in my life, I am very happy!
    <br>Yes, after being bedridden for three long years,
    <br>she has been set free after receiving prayers from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The discal hernia and two cysts in her spine are things of the past,
    <br>and she is now able to live a normal life once again in Christ Jesus.
    <br>To God be the glory!
