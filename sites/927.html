    <br>Anointing is the power of God; anointing is in the house.
    <br>I say, anointing is in the house.
    <br>All you need to do is to put your demand by faith on the anointing.
    <br>You are a faith man; you are a faith woman.
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Listen once again.
    <br>Grudge has created a room for depression.
    <br>Whatever you are facing is a result of a grudge you are holding against your fellow man.
    <br>Grudge, pain of the past, unforgiveness - whether you are right or wrong .
    <br>please, put everything behind you; they are your adverts.
    <br>How will you be known, if people are not talking about you?
    <br>The same mouth will praise - the same mouth will condemn.
    <br>This mouth cannot say one thing; it will condemn and it will praise.
    <br>If you are expecting people to praise you, you should expect people to condemn you.
    <br>Whatever pain, whatever happened in the past, please put it behind you, move forward.
    <br>All these are adverts.
    <br>You will soon be known all over the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, put your demand on the anointing.
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Let the power of God come down.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Let the power of the Lord from Heaven come down
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>You demon, in all places in your life,
    <br>begin to command them out, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You demon, listen to the voice of my people; I command you right now to leave my people!
    <br>I command you to leave my people!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, leave my people!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>Look, there are many things we need to observe when we are praying.
    <br>When you pray, wait; you talk - let God talk.
    <br>You pause and wait; let God talk.
    <br>When you continue to pray, you are not allowing God to reply you.
    <br>We are not allowing God. When you are praying -
    <br>we are praying: "Leave my people, in Jesus' name, amen!" - you pause.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You wait to see what God is about to do.
    <br>But we don't wait. Even in our home, we continue to pray, pray -
    <br>you are not waiting for God to talk to you.
    <br>You talk - God talks.
    <br>But it's one-sided - your prayer.
    <br>When you pray, I will join you in prayer. I say, "Ok, prayer", we pray.
    <br>When I now come in to say, "Hey, you demon, leave my people, in the name of Jesus!",
    <br>you say, "Amen!"; you pause.
    <br>You will see me pause. I will remain silent to see what God is about to do, how much God hears me.
    <br>But you will not wait to hear from God, you just... - your own is one way.
    <br>Just one way. If God talks, you don't want to listen. Your own is your own.
    <br>You have to pause. Can you see now?
    <br>It affects the response of God, if you don't allow Him to talk.
    <br>It really affects the response.
    <br>When you talk and you allow, you pause, wait to see -
    <br>while you are waiting, in your spirit you continue to say, "Thank You, God, for what You are about to do."
    <br>He manifests Himself.
    <br>But when you don't wait for Him to talk, to reply, to respond to what you are asking for
    <br>and you continue to talk, it affects Him; He will just, "Ok, continue talking.
    <br>When you get tired, you can go home".
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Viewers at home, viewers all over the world, I hope you understand what I am saying.
    <br>When you are praying on your own, after praying, you pause, you remain silent.
    <br>In your heart you say, "Thank You, Lord!" It means you are expecting Him to respond.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Assume you have been doing this, you would suddenly see yourself falling down.
    <br>If I am talking to mama now...
    <br>How are you, mum?
    <br>I am fine. Thanks.
    <br>If I say, "How are you?", you will say, "Fine."
    <br>But I'm not even waiting for her to respond.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Or I now say... It's God, I say, "Give me bread!"
    <br>If I say, "Give me bread", I will wait for you to give me.
    <br>But we don't wait, we say, "Give me bread".
    <br>This is crazy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>God's response is very important.
    <br>It is because we don't trust ourselves, we see prayer as conventional, in a traditional way -
    <br>we just have to pray because we are asked to pray.
    <br>If you really know you are talking to somebody, you should expect that somebody to reply.
    <br>If you know you are talking to somebody, you should also pause for the response of that person.
    <br>But in this case, you don't even believe you are talking to somebody - that is why we talk, talk, talk.
    <br>We are talking to someone, somebody in the person of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>God's response. Let someone say: "God's response."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[God's response.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[God's response.]
    <br>God's response must be noted.
    <br>When you say a word, you must wait for His response in the same moment.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every antichrist in every place in your life, leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
