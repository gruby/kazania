    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Yes, we have seen the presence of God.
    <br>It is always like that in the climate in the presence of God.
    <br>You can see the climate.
    <br>You see the move where God is present.
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of John 10:34-35,
    <br>'If you call them gods from whom the Word of God came - the Scripture cannot be broken'.
    <br>The question: How do we know a man of God?
    <br>We know a man of God by the words he speaks.
    <br>The words he speaks represent his heart's desire.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The words he speaks represent his heart's desire.
    <br>"Let there be light!" - and there is light. That is a man of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note: If the Word is not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>it will remain meaningless, idle and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If the Word is not according to (the Spirit of God) -
    <br>because we shall be judged by the Word we (speak).
    <br>If the Word is not according to the truth of the Gospel, according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>the Word will remain meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>Remember what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>That is what is happening to many of us:
    <br>If the words you speak are not according to God's Spirit,
    <br>because it is God's Spirit that reveals Jesus.
    <br>It is God's Spirit that makes the Word work.
    <br>The Word becomes a tool.
    <br>If the Word is not according to the Spirit of the Father,
    <br>it will remain idle, meaningless and oftentimes dangerous.
    <br>If you say 'Jesus' and the 'Jesus' you called is not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>satan will ask you, "By what authority? Who are you?"
    <br>We have seen the true Gospel today.
    <br>We need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
    <br>You have seen it; you have realised that God is reliable.
    <br>If I'm talking to you?
    <br>How many of us have realised that God is reliable?
    <br>I can't see your hand.
    <br>If you have realised that God is reliable, what else again?
    <br>Your faith will simultaneously grow.
    <br>Your love for Christ will simultaneously grow.
    <br>Your desire for Christ will simultaneously - side by side - lift up.
    <br>If your faith has grown today, let me see your hand.
    <br>Your faith, your love for Christ - so much!
    <br>Let me see your hand.
    <br>Your desire for Christ!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>That is the work of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Before we can repent, however, conviction must come.
    <br>Every day you get closer to God by the power of repentance.
    <br>The Bible says repentance is the greatest gift from God.
    <br>Repentance is possibly our greatest gift from God - that is conviction.
    <br>Conviction must come.
    <br>Conviction is the awakening of your conscience to the truth.
    <br>You and I have seen that God is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Do you know that God is greater than you and your problems?
    <br>Do you know that?
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>That is conviction.
    <br>Before you can repent, however, conviction must come.
    <br>Conviction is the awakening of your conscience to the truth.
    <br>"Ah, I need to go and read my Bible again."
    <br>"Ah, I thought I have read, I have finished Genesis to Revelation."
    <br>"Ah, I thought I know the Bible."
    <br>"Ah, I thought I'm a prayer warrior."
    <br>"Ah, I thought I know God."
    <br>"Ah, I thought I live in the wilderness."
    <br>"Ah, I need to go and read my Bible again."
    <br>"Again and again."
    <br>Awakening of your conscience to the truth.
    <br>What is the next thing now? Ask yourself.
    <br>Concerning God.
    <br>Ask yourself, "What is the next thing concerning God?"
    <br>Ask yourself, "What is the next thing for me concerning God?"
    <br>The best answer for anyone of us is: I'm still a baby.
    <br>I need to know more.
    <br>"So, God can be so real?"
    <br>That is one of the questions you ask yourself.
    <br>"God can be so real?"
    <br>God is great.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>God is great. That is God for you.
