    <br>Goodbye, oh world!
    <br>Goodbye.
    <br>God’s general CS UPTHEGROVE
    <br>1928 - 2018
    <br>For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil - 1 John 3:8
    <br>It is a good fight – a good warfare – the cause is good and the victory is sure,
    <br>if we continue, faithful and courageous.
    <br>The pastor of Miracle Valley Bible Training Centre and Miracle Valley International Revival Centre, the pastor of
    <br>healing, faith clinic is none other than Reverend C.S. Upthegrove from West Palm Beach, Florida.
    <br>Come on, let's give him a good hand.
    <br>This is the man whom God has sent.
    <br>Thank you, brother Allen.
    <br>Welcome to the Miracle Valley International Revival Centre.
    <br>I believe that God, today, is going to do a new thing.
    <br>God’s General C.S. Upthegrove
    <br>C.S. Upthegrove fought this good fight.
    <br>He fought it out and finished his course.
    <br>He did not give over till he was made more than a conqueror through God who loved him.
    <br>Evangelist C.S Upthegrove ranked among God's generals, ministered in the healing power of God
    <br>and preached the hope of the gospel of Jesus Christ to many in the US and around the world.
    <br>He began preaching the Word of God at the age of 15, and began seeing signs and wonders
    <br>in his revival meetings, where the sick were healed, the demon possessed were delivered
    <br>and the lost were saved.
    <br>In 1965, as a disciple of God's general A.A. Allen, he was ordained pastor of Miracle Valley in Arizona USA,
    <br>and people began coming from far and wide to receive their salvation, healing and deliverance.
    <br>This ministry continued until evangelist C.S. Upthegrove's peaceful passing.
    <br>In the late hours of Sunday, January 28th, 2018, the crown of life was placed upon his head.
    <br>Family and loved ones surrounded him, grateful to have had him in their midst.
    <br>Death to a good man is his release from the imprisonment of this world and his departure
    <br>to the enjoyments of another world.
    <br>He does not cease to be but is only removed from one world to another.
    <br>His legacy continues.
    <br>The best prayer we can offer our friends, family and loved ones is that the Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>may be with their spirits, to satisfy and save them and at the last, to receive them to Himself.
    <br>Many who believed as the God's generals did, are now before the throne, giving glory to the Lord.
    <br>May we be followers of them.
    <br>Goodbye, world!
    <br>From God’s General C.S. Upthegrove – 90 years
    <br>What a great comfort to a dying saint when he can look back upon his past life and say with Apostle Paul
    <br>in 2 Timothy 4:7, "I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith, the doctrine of faith,
    <br>and the grace of faith.
    <br>Towards the end of our days, to be able to speak in this manner, what comfort -
    <br>unspeakable  comfort - would it afford!
    <br>During the visit of God’s general C.S. Upthegrove to The SCOAN, he spent his quality time
    <br>with Prophet T.B. Joshua, prophesying about things to come and even his own death.
    <br>Now, let’s listen to God’s general C.S. Upthegrove prophesying concerning his passing unto glory.
    <br>Goodbye, oh world.
    <br>Goodbye.
    <br>God’s General C.S. Upthegrove
    <br>Well I told all my troubles goodbye
    <br>Goodbye to each tear and each sigh
    <br>This world where I roam cannot be my home
    <br>I'm bound for that land in the sky
    <br>Well I walk and I talk with my Lord
    <br>I feast everyday on His Word
    <br>Well Heaven is near and I can't stay here
    <br>So goodbye world goodbye
    <br>Goodbye, world!
    <br>Goodbye!
    <br>It takes faith to maintain your position to the end.
    <br>The beauty of our achievement is when we no longer live but that achievement is still there,
    <br>linger on in the eyes and ears of the children yet unborn. – T.B. Joshua
    <br>Goodbye, world! 
    <br>Goodbye!
