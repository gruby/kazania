    <br>Who am I that the Lord of all the earth
    <br>Would care to know my name
    <br>Would care to feel my hurt
    <br>Who am I
    <br>That the Bright and Morning Star
    <br>Would choose to light the way 
    <br>For my ever wandering heart
    <br>It’s not because of who I am 
    <br>But because of what You’ve done
    <br>It’s not because of what I’ve done 
    <br>But because of who You are
    <br>I am a flower quickly fading 
    <br>Here today and gone tomorrow
    <br>A wave tossed in the ocean 
    <br>A vapour in the wind
    <br>Still You hear me when I'm calling
    <br>Lord You catch me when I’m falling
    <br>And You told me who I am
    <br>I am Yours
    <br>If you believe you belong to Jesus, let me see you wave your hands.
    <br>Who am I 
    <br>That the eyes that see my sins
    <br>Would look on me with love 
    <br>And watch me rise again
    <br>Who am I
    <br>That the voice which calms the sea
    <br>Would call out through the rain 
    <br>And calm the storm in me
    <br>It’s not because of who I am 
    <br>But because of what You’ve done
    <br>It’s not because of what I’ve done 
    <br>But because of who You are
    <br>I am a flower quickly fading 
    <br>Here today and gone tomorrow
    <br>A wave tossed in the ocean 
    <br>A vapour in the wind
    <br>Still You hear me when I'm calling
    <br>Lord You catch me when I’m falling
    <br>And You told me who I am
    <br>I am Yours
    <br>I am a flower quickly fading 
    <br>Here today and gone tomorrow
    <br>A wave tossed in the ocean 
    <br>A vapour in the wind
    <br>Still You hear me when I'm calling
    <br>Lord You catch me when I’m falling
    <br>And You told me who I am
    <br>I am Yours
    <br>I am a flower quickly fading 
    <br>Here today and gone tomorrow
    <br>A wave tossed in the ocean 
    <br>A vapour in the wind
    <br>Still You hear me when I'm calling
    <br>Lord You catch me when I’m falling
    <br>And You told me who I am
    <br>I am Yours
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>We bless His holy name.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We oftentimes ignore our conscience.
    <br>We keep talking about the Holy Spirit. There is nothing bad about that.
    <br>We ignore our conscience, our heart.
    <br>But oftentimes, "Holy Spirit" which is good...
    <br>It is the same conscience the Holy Spirit uses to guide us.
    <br>The Holy Spirit uses our conscience to guide us, to guide our souls.
    <br>"Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit" - there would be nothing for the Holy Spirit to use.
    <br>Take note: your conscience, your heart.
    <br>If your heart is not there for the Holy Spirit, there is nothing the Holy Spirit can do;
    <br>He cannot reach you or contact you.
    <br>All the time we say, "Holy Spirit, God, Holy Spirit, God, Jesus, Holy Spirit",
    <br>but we ignore the fundamentals.
    <br>There is no way He could hit you, greet you, or reach you.
    <br>That is the very instrument the Holy Spirit uses to guide your soul.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't ignore your conscience".
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>- Don't ignore your conscience.
    <br>How do we ignore our conscience?
    <br>When yours is to pray but you don't know
    <br>that before you pray, you need to examine yourself.
    <br>If you don’t examine yourself and you pray, who are you praying to?
    <br>Am I really qualified? Am I to pray?
    <br>What am I doing? Who I am? Where am I coming from?
    <br>You examine yourself first.
    <br>Sometimes you may not even pray.
    <br>You do the examination.
    <br>It might be the examination you would do and just end there.
    <br>You may wake up in the morning,
    <br>look around, and be on the examination all through.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But today we wake up, jump up saying, "Jesus, thank You".
    <br>Yes, good, thank Him.
    <br>Hallelujah, bless me...
    <br>Who are you praying to?
    <br>Oftentimes, we ignore our conscience, the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit – our heart.
    <br>You can be on the examination, and just end the whole thing like that,
    <br>without even saying, "God help me",
    <br>because you know you are not worthy to even ask for that.
    <br>Because you are on the examination - you need to examine yourself.
    <br>You are not qualified.
    <br>You have to be qualified.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't ignore your conscience".
    <br>It is the very instrument the Holy Spirit Himself uses to guide us, to hear us.
    <br>Yes - the very instrument.
    <br>If you want to enter a forest, you have to make a path.
    <br>If there is no path, and there are thorns everywhere, you may be looking for any available road,
    <br>or path you can follow.
    <br>Until you get that, before you enter the forest, that path is what we call heart.
    <br>In order to have an effective prayer, there must not be anything between you and God.
    <br>This is what we are talking about – holding offences such as anger, bitterness,
    <br>pain of the past and so forth.
    <br>These are the things that live in our hearts.
    <br>This is what we are talking about – conscience, a place where those things live.
    <br>This is why many times you pray, you find out that you are talking to yourself.
    <br>Don’t ignore your conscience.
    <br>The Book of Romans 9:1 says, our conscience is the communication point. That is, the contact point.
    <br>It is what?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>That is the contact point.
    <br>If I don't contact this place, I cannot get to that place.
    <br>That is your heart. If God does not contact that place, He cannot touch your soul.
    <br>He cannot guide your soul.
    <br>He cannot guide you - let me put it this way.
    <br>If God does not contact this heart, He cannot guide you, He cannot talk to you.
    <br>That is your heart.
    <br>You can call it your spirit. 'Heart' means the spirit of man.
    <br>But we often ignore it.
    <br>We call the Holy Spirit to come down, whereas our heart is full of evil, offence, anger.
    <br>"Holy Spirit, come down."
    <br>Let's assume the Holy Spirit comes down.
    <br>He would be just moving around, He cannot come near you because the place of contact is dead.
    <br>This is why you are able to look upon pain, wrong and injustice towards your neighbour unaffected.
    <br>You look at your neighbour, "Let him die, it does not concern me.
    <br>You just look upon pain, wrong, injustice towards your neighbour unaffected.
    <br>"Let him die. Foolish him. He is a stupid man."
    <br>Or you learn your neighbour is in trouble, "Good. Yes, it is good for him.
    <br>"It is just good for him." - because your conscience is dead.
    <br>If your conscience is alive to God, if you hear that your greatest enemy is in problem,
    <br>you will start crying, thinking of how to rescue him.
    <br>If your conscience is alive to God and your greatest enemy is in trouble,
    <br>"How will I rescue? How will I help?"
    <br>You will be the first person to run there to rescue him.
    <br>You are able to pay evil for evil because your conscience is dead.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are able to hold unforgiveness, offence because your conscience is dead.
    <br>Don't you know that as a Christian, your situation could be any foolish thing?
    <br>Your situation is used to preserve you.
    <br>That is what God normally uses.
    <br>It is not joy or pleasure but a situation is what God often uses to preserve us,
    <br>to keep us for a new level, to reform us.
    <br>You were able to come to The Synagogue today because of your situation.
    <br>It is not out of plenty or joy that you rushed here.
    <br>It is one thing or another.
    <br>You either come here to give testimony of the situation God rescued you from or you are here...
    <br>Is that not preservation?
    <br>Is that not reforming you for a better position?
    <br>Is that not a blessing?
    <br>Our situation is not our enemy but our friend.
    <br>Your situation is not your enemy but your friend.
    <br>It is your situation that still keeps you going with God.
    <br>Many of us here, when you are released and you look here - plenty, abundant joy - God will likely lose you.
    <br>Strength often comes through situations.
    <br>It is not through joy, enjoyment.
    <br>Strength often comes through what?
    <br>Situation.
    <br>Strength.
    <br>I can do all things through God who strengthens me through situation.
    <br>Don't ignore your conscience.
    <br>Anytime you pray or talk to God, it is time to look inward
    <br>to see whether you are right or wrong before you pray.
    <br>You look inward to see whether you are right or wrong before you pray.
    <br>Don't ignore your conscience.
    <br>Your conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't ignore your conscience".
    <br>Your conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you.
    <br>There must not be anything between you and God if you want an effective prayer.
    <br>Holding offences such as bitterness, anger and so forth are the wall between you and God.
    <br>Wall - you build a wall.
    <br>God is here, you are here - offence.
    <br>I don't want you to waste your energy in offering prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don’t waste your energy and effort in prayer; your conscience should not be ignored".
    <br>If you ignore your conscience, you are wasting your time.
    <br>This is why anytime cannot be the best time for a true man of God to pray for you.
    <br>God always allots time; they need a corresponding power to pray.
    <br>Any time cannot be the best time to pray.
    <br>You cannot just rush to him, "Man of God, pray for me".
    <br>This is tradition today.
    <br>You rush to your man of God, "Man of God, please pray for me". - "In Jesus' name!" - "Amen."
    <br>No, any time cannot be the best time.
    <br>When Jesus was called to the feast, his brother called him, "Please, come out. There is a feast.
    <br>Time to demonstrate, to show the world that you are the Messiah",
    <br>Jesus said, "Look, any time cannot be the best time for me, but any time can be the best time for you,
    <br>to do whatever you want to do. But me - I need a corresponding grace,
    <br>before I can do what you ask me to do".
    <br>He said, "No, I am not going".
    <br>He said, "My time has not yet come".
    <br>If you rush to me, "Man of God, pray for me", I have to examine my conscience before praying for you.
    <br>That is why you cannot just rush to me, and I will pray
    <br>because I need to go back to my conscience to see,
    <br>"Am I in the position to pray or do I need to do some restitution?"
    <br>Imagine that I just came from outside there and I saw somebody in a pool of blood.
    <br>"Oh my God, I feel it."
    <br>My conscience is disturbed now
    <br>and someone just meets me and says, "Man of God, pray for me",
    <br>when my conscience is not at its best.
    <br>It is when our conscience is at its best that we can pray.
    <br>You know when your conscience is at its best,
    <br>you don't have anything to think about, to worry about - then you can offer prayer.
    <br>There are some certain things you ignore, you don't know.
    <br>Ok, like you wake up in the morning, after having a serious nightmare,
    <br>maybe somebody abused you or hit you, you just wake up.
    <br>"Oh my God, this was a nightmare."
    <br>"I rebuke it, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Whom are you rebuking when your mind is disturbed?
    <br>Whatever you say at that moment, it would be filtered through your worries.
    <br>What you need to do is to counsel yourself.
    <br>You wake up and say, "This was a nightmare. God, I cancel it, in Jesus' name. Thank You".
    <br>You have to make yourself happy.
    <br>You have to remember the message you have received in the past,
    <br>that when you are weak, then you are strong.
    <br>You have to remember all this.
    <br>You have to remember those messages immediately.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you come to your senses because when you lose control,
    <br>this is what satan does first - to make you lose control before making you a disciple.
    <br>When you lose control, you start misbehaving.
    <br>If you don’t lose control, satan cannot use you as a disciple or servant.
    <br>When you lose control, he takes you as a disciple and uses you.
    <br>If you don't lose control, you reason well.
    <br>But when you lose control, you cannot reason well; then he takes you as a disciple.
    <br>He can now use you as an errand boy to be sent anywhere he wants you to go.
    <br>That is why he uses offence to make you lose control.
    <br>Offence is the instrument that makes you lose control.
    <br>When offence comes, you lose control.
    <br>"Why all this? I don't know why!" - you have lost control.
    <br>Then satan comes, and you start doing the work of satan.
    <br>With bitterness in your heart, you lose control.
    <br>With anger, you lose control.
    <br>That is when satan takes us as his disciple.
    <br>You have to help.
    <br>Those of you who listen to this message, don't disturb men of God; you tempt them a lot.
    <br>You see a man of God sitting down and laughing.
    <br>You say, "Man of God, pray for me" - ha.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You meet a man of God on his way and ask, "Man of God, pray for me".
    <br>Do you know where the man of God is coming from?
    <br>In the same vein, you cannot jump into prayer.
    <br>You need to pause to examine your conscience.
    <br>A man of God too - our own is too serious.
    <br>We need corresponding power to do anything.
    <br>"Man of God, pray for me."
    <br>We need to examine our hearts before we offer prayer – effective prayer.
    <br>Because if there is something between us and God, we cannot offer prayer to God.
    <br>Take this home, and I know you will re-address yourself.
    <br>You cannot just jump into prayer.
    <br>This is why you see people who want to pray start with worship and praises.
    <br>They are using that to prepare their hearts.
    <br>They worship.
    <br>They are using that to prepare their hearts before going to prayer.
    <br>The Bible says in this world there will be offence; take heart, I have overcome.
    <br>Take heart means, don't hold an offence.
    <br>There will be an offence but do not hold it.
    <br>Offence will come - let it go, don't hold it.
    <br>The word HOLD - don't hold it.
    <br>When something comes, is passing and I hold it, it can become an instrument to be used,
    <br>but when it comes and I will allow it to go...
    <br>This is what the Bible says: In this world there will be an offence.
    <br>That offence will not come - no, there will be offence but do not hold it.
    <br>When it comes, allow it to go.
    <br>In this world it is not possible for you and I to live without an offence.
    <br>Don't hold it.
    <br>Don't hold an offence.
    <br>It will come.
    <br>Let it go.
    <br>This is why you have to examine yourself.
    <br>Don't ignore your conscience.
    <br>Your conscience is the very instrument used to guide you by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again, "Don't ignore your conscience".
    <br>It is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you.
    <br>It is like a ball. Even the best player today cannot start playing ball without a ball on the pitch.
    <br>If there is no ball on the pitch and you now started, what are you playing?
    <br>In the same vein, the Holy Spirit cannot get to you without your conscience.
    <br>This is why the Bible says, "Faith is of man's heart".
    <br>Only faith pleases God; faith is of man's heart.
    <br>That is, it is of man's spirit.
    <br>So please, take care of yourself.
    <br>Take your pen.
    <br>People look upon pain, wrong and injustice towards their neighbours unaffected.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>People look upon pain, wrong and injustice towards their neighbours unaffected.
    <br>Your neighbour could be your enemy, friend, those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>The Bible says, love them all.
    <br>But because they don't share the same faith with you, when you see them having a problem,
    <br> you ignore them, you look to the other side.
    <br>Because they don't share the same faith with you.
    <br>You are a Christian, they are not Christians.
    <br>Whatever problem they have, you would look to the other side.
    <br>No.
    <br>You have to rescue. Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>If your spirit, heart or conscience is alive to Christ, you would always be there for your neighbour.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If your conscience is alive to Christ, you would always be there for your neighbour.
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>That is why you say, "He is in the hospital? My prayer has been answered".
    <br>What kind of prayer is that?
    <br>"He is in the hospital?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No.
    <br>If it is your enemy...
    <br>The Bible has its backup there which says, "I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy".
    <br>If your enemy is not there, the table will be useless.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If your enemy does no longer live
    <br>and the table is set before you, with the essentials of life on it -
    <br>it is good for your enemy to see what you've become.
    <br>What they thought you cannot become, it is good for your enemy to see...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The thought, "You cannot become this or that",
    <br>it is better they see for themselves.
    <br>That may change them; you win their soul.
    <br>But all this deadness in the heart - die, kill...
    <br>"I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy."
    <br>On the table, essentials of life - those things you need for life: peace, comfort, prosperity.
    <br>A good example of what we are talking about is we here today.
    <br>If we begin to examine the hearts, the conscience of everyone here,
    <br>at least forty to fifty percent of you never thought they would come here.
    <br>You had a different impression about T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You were in opposition to T.B. Joshua in the past.
    <br>But today you are alive to see that he is your friend.
    <br>He is not your enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you had died then, would you be able to see this?
    <br>If I have died then, would I be here today?
    <br>"I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy."
    <br>What is the way out?
    <br>Ask me for the way out for you.
    <br>I want to hear your voice.
    <br>[What is the way out?]
    <br>Pray for your enemy.
    <br>I repeat. Ask me again.
    <br>[What is the way out?]
    <br>Pray for your enemy.
    <br>Prayer from your heart, not from your lips.
    <br>From your heart.
    <br>Down from your heart.
    <br>Ask me again.
    <br>[What is the way out?]
    <br>Pray for your enemy.
    <br>If you choose the path of praying for your enemy, you will have a great relief.
    <br>Because you are running to defeat, to overcome your enemy, 
    <br>it has taken you to many places - spiritually, physically, morally, financially.
    <br>You spent a lot of money.
    <br>It has given you sleepless nights, fear, anxiety, pressure.
    <br>Every bad thing that happens to you, when you have a nightmare, you attribute it to your enemy.
    <br>The pain you are going through, it is not your enemy that is going through it.
    <br>It is you that is going through the pain.
    <br>Why can't you ignore your enemy and move forward? Pray for them!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are the one going through the pain.
    <br>If someone curses you, saying, "I curse your leg"
    <br>and you immediately start walking like this,
    <br>you are going through the pain, and at the same time you are pursuing him.
    <br>You are going through the pain and at the same time, you are fighting the person that cursed your leg.
    <br>Two battles.
    <br>You walk like this.
    <br>When you want to praise Him, "God, this man, I curse him.
    <br>Oh Jesus, I curse him".
    <br>When you begin to chase your enemy, you will automatically forget the condition
    <br>in which you are.
    <br>It is not possible to look at two sides: I am looking here and at the same time, I am looking here.
    <br>When I am looking here, I cannot look there at the same time.
    <br>So, if I am going through pain that that enemy has caused
    <br>and at the same time, I am pursuing that enemy that caused it,
    <br>I will ignore this pain - the pain will be there but how to take care of myself,
    <br>will be ignored whilst I'm after this.
    <br>This is why your situation is persisten, continuous.
    <br>The situation you were supposed to go through within one week, you have been in it for the past one year
    <br>because you ignore your condition, and you are pursuing your enemy.
    <br>Enemy is something that you should define.
    <br>I'm here - my enemy.
    <br>If I now ask for progress, and I have that progress,
    <br>I will meet my enemy in that position again; I've left that enemy.
    <br>The bigger your success, the bigger your enemy.
    <br>Why are you wasting your time when you know it is a normal life.
    <br>It is a normal thing, a way of life.
    <br>My trials cannot be your trials because of my position.
    <br>I will not go through your trial.
    <br>You will go through your trials according to your position
    <br>and I will go through my trials according to my position.
    <br>It is our position that attracts trials.
    <br>What attracts trials?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Our position.
    <br>You are in the university, second degree.
    <br>They will not send a primary school teacher to you to come and inspect your job.
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>They will send a professor or PhD holder that can supervise you,
    <br>not a primary or secondary school teacher.
    <br>In the same vein, your position in life attracts persecution and trials.
    <br>If your position is big, it will attract big trials.
    <br>If your position is small, it will attract small trials
    <br>and you always pray for big position, big blessing.
    <br>That big blessing will attract a big trial.
    <br>If you do not want trial, you do not want success in life.
    <br>When people talk about you, when you go here, they say, "He is a foolish man",
    <br>go there, "He is a foolish man", here, "She is a foolish woman"
    <br>you know it is a recognition.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They ignore people that are nothing.
    <br>If a president enters here now, everybody would start looking.
    <br>That is attention because of his position.
    <br>But if you enter nobody would look at you.
    <br>They would say, "Please, go back".
    <br>The usher would not even allow you to enter.
    <br>What we are trying to say is that,
    <br>what you are going through should not rule your life.
    <br>What you are going through does not matter but what matters is whom you are.
    <br>It is your situation that has subjected you to what you are now today.
    <br>Sometimes you can observe people talking to themselves.
    <br>You think they have a mental problem. It is not a mental problem.
    <br>It is a result of their situation.
    <br>You see people walking and laughing.
    <br>It is not mental.
    <br>There are many people on the street today that you think are mental - they are not.
    <br>It is as a result of situation; their situation is overwhelming them.
    <br>When your situation overwhelms you, you lose control.
    <br>You become satan's disciple.
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, listen to me.
    <br>Don't ignore your conscience.
    <br>Your conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide you, to hear your prayer.
    <br>Can't you hear what the Bible says in the Book of Matthew,
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God".
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.]
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall see God.
    <br>Our heart is the very instrument used by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>If you ignore it, you ignore God; if you ignore it, you ignore the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When it is time to pray, it is time to examine yourself first.
    <br>Time to pray is the time to do what?
    <br>This is why I gave you... I'm seeing my brother...
    <br>Brother, please bring it.
    <br>This is why you have this. This is examination.
    <br>This is to prepare your way.
    <br>This will help your heart to contact the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It will take you out and take you in.
    <br>There is nothing to say - people that hold it, "Take more of me".
    <br>It is a way of examining your heart.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You" - it means you are more of yourself.
    <br>If you are more of yourself, you are finished - you are losing control.
    <br>When we are more of ourselves, we have become satan's servants.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You; more of Your faithfulness, Your kindness, Your goodness,
    <br>Your holiness, Your humility. Lord Jesus, take more of me, give me more of You.
    <br>More of You.
    <br>You can know.
    <br>With our heart we know Jesus is righteous.
    <br>With our heart we know Jesus heals, blesses, saves and delivers.
    <br>It is not with our eyes.
    <br>Some people would say, "I want to see that healing".
    <br>Even when you see the healing taking place, you will see it but not receive it.
    <br>At the end you will say, "Ha, it happened to some people, but it never happened to me.
    <br>That thing is not working for me".
    <br>No.
    <br>It is not with our eyes but with our hearts we know Jesus is righteous.
    <br>And we are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Let somebody say, "With our heart we know Jesus is righteous.
    <br>We know Jesus heals, saves, blesses, delivers with our hearts".
    <br>If you have not seen with your heart, you cannot receive from God.
    <br>With your heart, you receive healing, blessing, deliverance.
    <br>Not with our eyes.
    <br>"I saw it, I witnessed it" - no, who told you this?
    <br>With our heart, we walk with the Lord, we see the Lord, praise Him and pray.
    <br>The Bible says that Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Let someone say, "Christianity lies in the heart".
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Christianity lies in the heart.]
    <br>That is it.
    <br>But you do not know this.
    <br>You say, "T.B. Joshua, I want to see with my eyes".
    <br>I want to see.
    <br>When I say, "Be healed", they will look, "Is there any ring on the hand?
    <br>How many times he said, 'Be healed'?
    <br>'Be healed', 'Be healed' - oh, two times - let me write it down.
    <br>Ok, he turned right. After 'Be healed', 'Be healed', he turned right. I will write it.
    <br>Look at the way he walks. This is the way he walks - let me write it down.
    <br>After that healing he laughed - let me write it down".
    <br>So now, you too will say, "Be healed! Be healed!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>These eyes.
    <br>No.
    <br>With our heart we know Jesus is righteous.
    <br>So, in this case, if with our heart, we know Jesus is righteous,
    <br>it means that not all people that say, "Jesus", belong to Jesus
    <br>because one can say "Jesus" not with the heart.
    <br>This is so difficult for ignorants to know who is following Jesus.
    <br>It is so difficult for ignorants today to know the true pastor.
    <br>It is so difficult for ignorants to know the true church of God.
    <br>And 99% of the world is ignorant.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You want me to repeat?
    <br>99% of the world is ignorant when it comes to the things of the Spirit.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>When it comes to the things of the Spirit, heavenly things, 99% are ignorant.
    <br>How would they know the true church?
    <br>How would they know the true ministers of God?
    <br>How would they know the true worshipper?
    <br>How would they know the true person? How would they know who is who?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is where we find ourselves.
    <br>We find ourselves in a very big situation.
    <br>What matters most to God is your heart.
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>What matters most to God is your heart.
    <br>Because your heart is the contact point.
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>Because your heart is the contact point.
    <br>You have to guide your heart
    <br>because your heart is the contact point.
    <br>Before you call Jesus, take care of your heart first.
    <br>How do you take care of your heart? By looking to see if you are holding offences
    <br>such as bitterness, anger, hatred, pain of the past and so forth.
    <br>If you do, don't be surprised if the Bible is no longer real for you.
    <br>That is, the value is no longer there.
    <br>When you open the Bible and you fall asleep, you know there is something wrong with you.
    <br>You open the Bible, you want to read - you start sleeping.
    <br>Don't be surprised if the Bible is no longer of value, real.
    <br>It will become a literature.
    <br>If you hold an offence, pain of the past, and you open the Bible, you are reading literature, not the Bible.
    <br>If you have pain of the past, bitterness, hatred, offence, you are not happy, you are disturbed
    <br>and you open the Bible, you are reading literature, history, not the Bible.
    <br>When you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You are looking at yourself and He is looking at you.
    <br>The Bible is a mirror.
    <br>When you look through the mirror, you will see yourself.
    <br>But the Bible is no longer a mirror to you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Holy Bible is a mirror".
    <br>That is MIRROR.
    <br>When you take a mirror and look at yourself, look through it,
    <br>you will see yourself, how you look like.
    <br>When you are reading the Bible, you are looking at yourself.
    <br>But we usually hold offences all the time.
    <br>When you read the Bible while holding an offence, the Bible is no longer real, it cannot be real.
    <br>Let me tell you about the Bible.
    <br>Holy men were carried along by the Holy Spirit to write the Word you see in the Bible.
    <br>They were carried along to write what you are reading.
    <br>When you want to read, you must also be carried along, when your heart is free.
