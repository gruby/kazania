    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Greet your other neighbour, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>'Emmanuel' means, God is with us.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua, The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV family,
    <br>I greet you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ
    <br>and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>We can see the atmosphere is already charged.
    <br>That means, today is your day of healing.
    <br>Today is your day of deliverance.
    <br>Today is your day of freedom.
    <br>The job has already been done by Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>By the grace of God, my name is Chris.
    <br>I'm originally from here - the United Kingdom.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>I have a very important message to share with you today from the heart of God.
    <br>And I pray this message will penetrate deep into your heart today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The Bible says in Deuteronomy 10:17-19 that
    <br>God loves the widows, orphans and strangers.
    <br>Therefore, man, if he loves God, is under obligation to love them.
    <br>What this simply means is:
    <br>If you love God, you are under obligation to love your fellow man.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and tell them, "Neighbour, if you love God,
    <br>you are under obligation to love your fellow man".
    <br>Love for God and love for your neighbour
    <br>constitute the essence of what God requires of man.
    <br>This is the core, the heart of God’s message to mankind.
    <br>Brethren, there is nothing in your life that is more important to God than your love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour; say, "Neighbour, there is nothing in your life more important to God than your love".
    <br>This will lead us to the title of today’s message:
    <br>THE CORE OF GOD’S MESSAGE TO MANKIND
    <br>Our proof text for today's message will be taken from the Book of Mark 12:28-31.
    <br>Please turn with me in your Bibles to the Gospel of Mark 12:28-31 and I read:
    <br>“Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together,
    <br>perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?”
    <br>Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is:
    <br>‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
    <br>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul,
    <br>with all your mind, and with all your strength.’
    <br>This is the first commandment.
    <br>And the second, like it, is this: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’"
    <br>Now listen to these words of Jesus.
    <br>"There is no other commandment greater than these.”
    <br>What does God want from us above all else?
    <br>Above our prayers, songs, tears.
    <br>What does He want from us above all else?
    <br>Our love.
    <br>This is what Jesus Christ emphasised here
    <br>when He was asked what was the most important commandment.
    <br>He replied, quoting Deuteronomy 6:4-5,
    <br>‘It is not enough to believe in the unity of God; we must love Him supremely’.
    <br>And He added that the second commandment in importance
    <br>is to love our neighbour as ourselves, quoting Leviticus 19:18.
    <br>In other words, to summarise this:
    <br>Love God supremely and love others as yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour; say, "Neighbour, love God supremely and love others as yourself".
    <br>This is the core of God's message to mankind.
    <br>The challenge before us today is that
    <br>many say they love God but they do not love their fellow neighbour.
    <br>They say, "I love God" but they are indifferent towards their fellow neighbour.
    <br>And I'm here to tell you today this important truth.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>In fact, God measures our lives by our love for our neighbour.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, look at them and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>God measures my life by my love for you".
    <br>Don't forget - when I say 'your neighbour',
    <br>your neighbour can be your enemy,
    <br>your neighbour can be those who don't share the same faith with you.
    <br>As Matthew 5:43-48 says, 'Love them all for we are known by our love'.
    <br>The love you have for your neighbour determines the relationship you have with God.
    <br>I mean, the amount of love you give, you show to your neighbour
    <br>determines the amount of relationship you have with God.
    <br>Let me ask you a probing question.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>How many people have you shown love to today?
    <br>How many people have you shown care to today?
    <br>Because God measures our life by our love for our fellow neighbour.
    <br>As we are here today, sitting in this wonderful arena,
    <br>there are many people right now who are in the hospital, on the sickbed.
    <br>How many of them do you have as a friend?
    <br>We shouldn't just have those who are fit, healthy, strong as our friends.
    <br>We should also have those on the sickbed - go there, visit them,
    <br>take their phone number, give them a call,
    <br>"Hi, how are you? How is everything? How are you doing?",
    <br>pray for them, pray with them.
    <br>Who knows - that may be all that is needed for their recovery.
    <br>God measures your life by your love for your neighbour.
    <br>The love you show to your neighbour, the love you show to that person on the sickbed
    <br>reflects your relationship with God.
    <br>How much you love them is how much you love God.
    <br>How much you care for them is how much you care about God.
    <br>This is the centre of our message today; this is the reason why we are here today - love.
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, look at your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>I am because you are; you are because I am".
    <br>That is love.
    <br>The area that I am strong, you may be weak.
    <br>The area that you are strong, I may be weak.
    <br>We are one another's strength.
    <br>People of God, let us love one another instead of making jest or mockery of one another.
    <br>Instead of making jokes at each other's expense, laughing behind people's backs,
    <br>let us help one another.
    <br>Instead of looking the other way when your neighbour is in trouble,
    <br>"Let him face his business, I will face mine. Each man to his own",
    <br>let us care for one another.
    <br>Care for one another.
    <br>Instead of belittling others' opinions or rejecting someone because of their weakness -
    <br>love never rejects anyone because of weakness.
    <br>Love knows that if you reject someone on account of their weakness, you also reject their strength.
    <br>Tell your neighbour; say, "Neighbour,
    <br>if you reject someone on account of their weakness, you also reject their strength".
    <br>Genuine love forgives and forgets the wrong, so there is hope for the future.
    <br>Just take a look at what is happening in the world today,
    <br>happening in our country today.
    <br>Where the world and its people find themselves today is as a result of lack of genuine love.
    <br>This has put the world on the brink of hopelessness.
    <br>Love is lost.
    <br>We must look for love.
    <br>We must find love.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>The love I am talking about is the love of God.
    <br>The love of God is a thing of the heart.
    <br>The love of God is processing; it’s not cash and carry.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by 'cash and carry'?
    <br>When you enter a supermarket and you see what you want,
    <br>you say, "Ah, these vegetables look very nice!" - you see and you buy.
    <br>This chicken is half-price - you see it, you get it.
    <br>This muesli, this cereal is buy one, get one free - you see it, you get it.
    <br>Cash and carry - see and love, see and accept,
    <br>see and admire, see and take without processing.
    <br>That is not the love of God.
    <br>Look at what is happening in our society today.
    <br>You see the amount of broken homes; divorce is rampant
    <br>because a man sees a woman - you see her beauty, you admire the beauty -
    <br>you see and marry.
    <br>A woman sees a man - you see the handsomeness, the outward qualities -
    <br>you get married - see and love, see and take,
    <br>see and admire, see and accept without processing.
    <br>Our businesses - you see your friend's business prosper, you say, "I will do the same business".
    <br>See and accept, see and admire, see and love without processing.
    <br>Even in the house of God.
    <br>You see someone preach with eloquence and charisma, ability to inspire
    <br>and you quickly conclude he is of God without processing.
    <br>This is not the love of God.
    <br>All that you see happening here today must be examined in the light of God's Word
    <br>because if faith must grow, it has to start little.
    <br>Don't quickly jump to a conclusion.
    <br>Don't immediately arrive at a conclusion.
    <br>Let your heart examine everything you see today in the light of God’s Word and then,
    <br>take the decision of relationship because love is a relationship.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>Let me quickly interrupt the message here.
    <br>This is a holy interruption.
    <br>I believe this is the right time, this is the proper time for us to do an offering in the presence of God.
    <br>You know the Bible says - it is scriptural to give an offering.
    <br>The Bible says when you do so, God will open the floodgates of Heaven
    <br>and pour out such a blessing that you will not be able to contain it.
    <br>That is Malachi 3:10.
    <br>Let us rise to our feet wherever you are in the auditorium right now.
    <br>Let us rise to our feet and let us raise up our offering right now.
    <br>Make sure it is your quality one.
    <br>Not just what you don't need, not just the spare change you brought here today.
    <br>Raise up your offering right now
    <br>and we are going to pray together, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Raise it up together right now and let us pray.
    <br>Let your way be blessed!
    <br>Let your handwork be blessed!
    <br>Let your efforts be blessed!
    <br>Let everything you lay your hands on be blessed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>People of God, it is true there is need for your offering here.
    <br>It is biblical, scriptural.
    <br>But there are some of your neighbours who need this offering more than we do.
    <br>I repeat.
    <br>There are some of your neighbours who need this offering more than we do.
    <br>You have a neighbour who has lost his job,
    <br>struggling to fend for his family, send his kids to school.
    <br>You have a neighbour who is homeless, battling addiction and rejection on the street.
    <br>You have a neighbour who is in an orphanage home -
    <br>he has lost his loved ones - worrying about his future.
    <br>You have a neighbour who is academically brilliant
    <br>but financially incapable of paying his school fees.
    <br>You have a neighbour who is in the hospital bed right now, lying down in a hopeless situation.
    <br>If you give us, we will give it to those people.
    <br>So, please, help us give them.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>I repeat.
    <br>Help us give them.
    <br>Whatever God puts in your heart to bring as an offering today,
    <br>go and use it to bless your neighbour who is in need.
    <br>Remember, your neighbour can be your enemy,
    <br>your neighbour can be those who not share the same faith with you, etc.
    <br>Go and give them.
    <br>Don't pocket it.
    <br>This is 'Amen' to the blessings you have received here today.
    <br>Thank you for taking it to them.
    <br>You may have your seats.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>Thank you for taking it to them.
    <br>Please, people of God, I'm not just here referring to your cash
    <br>but the area you are strong in.
    <br>You may not be strong financially but your quality time, your quality love,
    <br>your quality strength - every good thing God has given to you - use it to bless your neighbour.
    <br>Not just when we leave here.
    <br>You should see this as an assignment from God.
    <br>See your contribution to others daily as an assignment from God.
    <br>For when you see it as an assignment from God, you cannot afford to fail God.
    <br>God bless you as you do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>Please take note:
    <br>I'm not saying that the ministry does not need your offerings.
    <br>But such support should not be given because we have helped you
    <br>or because God has given us the grace to pray for you - no!
    <br>Let it come from your heart.
    <br>I repeat: Let it come from your heart.
    <br>Coming from your heart means - examine everything in the Light of God's Word.
    <br>It is not just cash and carry.
    <br>Our coming here today is not just cash and carry because of the nature of our job.
    <br>I give money, I receive healing.
    <br>I give money, I receive deliverance.
    <br>I give money, I receive blessing.
    <br>To enter the arena today, I pay a ticket fee - no!
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>That is not the love of God.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>Healing is not our work; it is God's work.
    <br>Deliverance is not our work; it is God's work.
    <br>Breakthrough is not our work; it is God's work.
    <br>The secret of all the miracles is Jesus!
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>If you pay a ticket fee to enter here today, because of the nature of this event,
    <br>whatever you claim to receive is not from the love of God
    <br>because healing, deliverance, blessings, miracles cannot be exchanged with whatever.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>We are here for a relationship forever, a relationship forever is a thing of the heart.
    <br>Whatever you see happening here today demands for a relationship which is a process.
    <br>You see, you examine what you see in the light of God's Word
    <br>and then, you can come to the conclusion, "This is of God; it is time for a relationship".
    <br>That is the kind of relationship that will last - the kind of relationship that will stand the test of time.
    <br>Just look around this arena today.
    <br>Just quickly look to your left.
    <br>Look to your right; look at the wonderful gathering here today.
    <br>There are different categories of people who are here today.
    <br>There are some who sold their property to come here,
    <br>there are some who had to take a loan from the bank just to get their flight ticket to be here today.
    <br>There are some, yes, who used out of abundance
    <br>and there are some who used all they have to be here.
    <br>How do we now minister to everyone?
    <br>Those who sold their property to come here today -
    <br>can we collect money from such people?
    <br>Or those of you that are here in need of healing, in need of deliverance,
    <br>in need of blessing, breakthrough -
    <br>is that the right time to ask for monetary support?
    <br>Love is not exchanged.
    <br>Love gives, love cares, love shares without expecting anything in return
    <br>because God is the Rewarder of those who love their neighbour.
    <br>That is the core of God's message to mankind.
    <br>Love.
    <br>People of God, it is not just enough to say,
    <br>"I'm a Christian, I'm a child of God, I'm a believer".
    <br>Just as it is not enough to say, "I'm an engineer, I'm a footballer, I'm a medical doctor".
    <br>It is not just enough to say it.
    <br>We are what we do, not only what we say.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>Tell your neighbour; say, "Neighbour, we are what we do, not only what we say".
    <br>Therefore, match your actions with your words.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>Yes, match your actions with your words.
    <br>God is measuring your love for your fellow man.
    <br>Is it burning in your heart, is it living, is it practical?
    <br>Because God knows if you don't really love your neighbour, then, you don't really love Him.
    <br>How many of us here today love God?
    <br>How many of us here today know God?
    <br>You know God, only as far as you love your neighbour with all your heart.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>If God is leading you, it is love that is leading you.
    <br>Letting God lead is letting love lead.
    <br>Love will always lead you to those who are in need of what you have and what you possess
    <br>just as love will also lead you to what you yourself need.
    <br>To bring this message to a conclusion:
    <br>I want you to turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of 1 John 4.
    <br>I would encourage you in your spare time to read the entire chapter
    <br>but I'm just going to pick one or two verses
    <br>which is a wonderful summary of this message.
    <br>Verses 7 to 8.
    <br>"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God;
    <br>and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God."
    <br>He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
    <br>Verses 20 to 21.
    <br>"...for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen,
    <br>how can he love God whom he has not seen?
    <br>And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also."
    <br>We are here today, looking for God.
    <br>You are here today, looking unto God for His mercy, for His favour,
    <br>for His healing, deliverance, breakthrough, blessing, miracle.
    <br>But the Bible says here, God is not only unseen but seen.
    <br>'Whatsoever you do to the least of your brothers, that you do unto Me', says Jesus.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>Matthew 25:45.
    <br>"I want to know the church you are attending;
    <br>I want to know the religion you belong to;
    <br>I want to know the political party you are affiliated with;
    <br>I want to know your family background - before I love you."
    <br>That is not the love of God.
    <br>The way out is simple:
    <br>Love one another irrespective of religion, colour, ethnicity - let love lead.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV UK Revival
    <br>For love has a language that transcends all other languages, barriers and distance.
    <br>I pray that your love for one another will not fail, in Jesus' name!
    <br>May God bless His Word.
