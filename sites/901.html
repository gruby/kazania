    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>You demon - leave my people!
    <br>Prayer!

    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Cockroach Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>I have seen Jesus walking in the Spirit.
    <br>I have seen power of Jesus walking in the Spirit.
    <br>I have seen the Word of God walking in the Spirit.
    <br>Cockroach Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>See what has happened - that is the power of God.
    <br>Cockroach Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This is the lady who during the time of the mass prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua vomited this large insect,
    <br>which has a form of a cockroach.
    <br>You can see it in the midst of some vomit, which has very vile smell.
    <br>Right now, we want to hear from the lady herself.
    <br>Madam, you're welcome. 
    <br>Can you tell us your name and where are you from?
    <br>My name is Chantel Bridget. 
    <br>I come from Cameroon.
    <br>What was the problem you were having?
    <br>The problem I had was blockage and I ate in the dream all the time.
    <br>I had a moving object in my womb, all the time, which caused miscarriages.
    <br>Recently, my children started dying and something was moving in my womb.
    <br>You mean that any time you would be pregnant something would stop the pregnancy,
    <br>something would eat the child in your womb?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What happened to you during the time of the mass prayer?
    <br>What did you feel?
    <br>During the mass prayer, I started feeling strong pain all over my womb.
    <br>Something was turning round and around in my womb.
    <br>After that I started vomiting and I vomited this insect.
    <br>I thank God; now, I am free!
    <br>How do you feel while pressing your stomach now?
    <br>Are you feeling any pain?
    <br>Nothing! Now, I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for delivering me and my family.
    <br>Amen. We give all glory to God.
    <br>We thank Him for delivering her.
    <br>She is free from this moving object, which she vomited during the mass prayer -
    <br>it came out in the form of a cockroach.
    <br>That is what you are seeing right now on the floor.
    <br>This happened some moments ago, letting us know that there is never a problem you cannot solve,
    <br>never a burden Jesus Christ cannot bear.
    <br>This happened just now, during the mass prayer time when Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying
    <br>along with people here and with those watching - and this is what happened.
    <br>This lady was delivered, set free from this problem of moving object, which came out in a form of a cockroach,
    <br>when she vomited it during this time.
    <br>We give all glory to God.
    <br>She is rejoicing now.
    <br>She says the pain she was feeling before has gone from the womb.
    <br>Today she is delivered and set free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for delivering me and my family.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good morning church!
    <br>[Good morning.]
    <br>My names are Chantal Bridget Nyemeck.
    <br>I come from Cameroon.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was evil attack and moving object in my womb.
    <br>This evil attack manifested in that I usually saw dead people,
    <br>even my husband who is dead, in my dream.
    <br>I ate in the dream and drank in the dream.
    <br>I usually saw myself in dirty places, old houses and things that were very dirty.
    <br>And I have spirit...
    <br>On the other side, I had a spiritual husband and small children.
    <br>On this side, I had big children.
    <br>All the time, I had moving objects in my body.
    <br>I usually watched Emmanuel TV in Cameroon.
    <br>I had a dream and saw the man of God.
    <br>He asked me, "My daughter, why does everybody hate you?"
    <br>He carried me like a baby and threw me in the water.
    <br>People around me started clapping, "You are saved!"
    <br>That was why I came here, to look for a solution to my case.
    <br>OK. So, we are listening to what our sister is saying; how she actually had a dream before coming to The SCOAN
    <br>after praying along with Prophet T.B Joshua on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>In that world, where she used to see herself in the dream, which is full of dead people
    <br>she actually saw Prophet T.B. Joshua and he placed her in water and her body was cleansed.
    <br>Is that right, madam?
    <br>Yes, he threw me in a big river and I washed myself.
    <br>After that, people around me were clapping, "You have changed, madam".
    <br>Last week you came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Tell us what happened during the mass prayer.
    <br>During the mass prayer, I was sitting over there.
    <br>I prayed, "God, can I return to Cameroon with the same case? God, do my own today, please".
    <br>During the mass prayer when the man of God prayed, he did not touch me.
    <br>I prayed; after some time, I felt pain in my womb.
    <br>I turned and begun to vomit poison; then, I vomited this cockroach.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Our sister is explaining that as the mass prayer was  going on she felt the power of God move around her
    <br>and her stomach.
    <br>At that minute madam, what happened to you, as you began to feel the sensation in your stomach?
    <br>What happened next?
    <br>After I vomited, the pain stopped.
    <br>Now, I sleep well.
    <br>I don’t see dead people in my dream any more.
    <br>I sleep well, like a baby.
    <br>That is why I came here to testify.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, when you vomited out that cockroach, that insect' immediately after that
    <br>you realized that the moving object in your body disappeared.
    <br>The moving object has stopped.
    <br>Now, I'm feeling fine; I am fine.
    <br>And you began to sleep well, no more nightmares - is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, can you just touch your stomach now?
    <br>How are you feeling after the prayer?
    <br>No, I am fine; nothing hurts in my body.
    <br>Well, thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We can just imagine - what we have seen on the screen here; that cockroach was the physical manifestation
    <br>of that spirit that had actually been destroying our sister's life.
    <br>You listened to her; how she had been plagued with terrible nightmares, seeing herself in the midst
    <br>of dead people, with a strange man - her husband in the dream, in another world.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed, the power of God flowed through her body.
    <br>We see how she vomited out this insect and ever since then she has been completely free,
    <br>and she has been sleeping like a baby, to the glory of God.
    <br>So, one more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Madam, what can you say about this insect that came out?
    <br>Were you surprised to see such a thing coming out?
    <br>I don't want to see it again.
    <br>I am afraid of it when I see it.
    <br>Our sister was shocked to see such an object coming out of her.
    <br>But, to the glory of God, she is free now.
    <br>Finally madam, what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My advice goes like this: trust God; have faith.
    <br>It may be one year, two years or ten years but God will remember you.
    <br>One day, you will receive your own testimony like me.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chantal Bridget Neymeck.
    <br>I come from Cameroon.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>were evil attack in my dreams and moving objects in my womb.
    <br>These problems affected my life; I couldn't laugh and cried everywhere I went.
    <br>That was why I decided to come to The SCOAN, looking for a solution to my problems.
    <br>Tell us, when you came to The SCOAN, what happened to you.
    <br>On that day during the mass prayer, I asked God, "Can I return to Cameroon with the same case?
    <br>God, please help me".
    <br>I didn’t finish my prayer when I felt a very bad pain in my womb.
    <br>As the man of God started praying, during the mass prayer, my senses were gone and I started vomiting.
    <br>On that day, everyone saw me vomit a cockroach.
    <br>After I vomited it, the pain stopped.
    <br>I didn’t feel anything; my womb is OK.
    <br>Everything is OK.
    <br>That is why I thank God.
    <br>Now, I sleep well – like a baby.
    <br>I have no bad dreams anymore, no pain anymore and I eat.
    <br>Since that day, I have not seen any evil thing again in my dreams.
    <br>As I told you before - I sleep well.
    <br>We really thank God for what God has done in your life.
    <br>We want you to know that man of God loves you and your family so much.
    <br>After that prayer of the man of God, and now, when we know that God Almighty has solved your problem
    <br>and healed you completely of your sickness; tell us about your condition as a widow.
    <br>It is a very bad experience; since I lost my husband, there has been nothing to eat.
    <br>My children couldn't go to school.
    <br>I needed to do anything to eat.
    <br>But starting today, that situation has ended.
    <br>Tell us what kind of things were you doing just to feed you and your children.
    <br>I usually sold peanuts in the market in my country and cleaned houses for wealthy people
    <br>before I would be able to eat.
    <br>So, more or less, you were like a housemaid?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, how do you feel, knowing that the God Almighty has healed you
    <br>and is also about to bless you abundantly?
    <br>Now, I'm very happy; I don’t know how to explain my happiness.
    <br>I'm very happy; man of God, be blessed!
    <br>The man of God in his grace and mercy is giving you this gift of morning water with the booklet
    <br>and also he is blessing you with the mirror - a book that will show you what you were, what you are,
    <br>and what you are about to be in the future.
    <br>Finally, he is blessing you with the sum of 200 000 naira to help your financial needs
    <br>and to take care of your family and your children.
    <br>Wow, I didn’t expect to receive this huge amount of money; I'm very happy!
    <br>Now, I am healed; I am blessed.
    <br>It is enough money for me; when I return to Cameroon, I will start a business,
    <br>train my children and pay their school fees.
    <br>Everything will be fine.
    <br>Amen. Indeed, we thank God for what the Lord has done in your life
    <br>and we are also happy and we rejoice with you.
    <br>We want to encourage you to continue to make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Remember, you have been delivered by the Word of God - you need to go and continue to be ruled by His Word,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Man of God, thank you; you will be blessed!
    <br>The advice I need to give people all over the world who are looking at me is:
    <br>you need to have faith.
    <br>No matter what you are passing through, you need to have faith.
    <br>You need to come to this place.
    <br>It is a final place you were looking for.
    <br>I thank God.
