    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>to bring healing, deliverance to people, who have come from all over
    <br>seeking solution from the healer Jesus Christ.
    <br>As he moves along the line, he encounters this woman,
    <br>and the unclean spirit within her begins to manifest.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirit.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be set free!
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I'm her husband.
    <br>What have you done to her, as a spiritual husband?
    <br>Her career, her education?
    <br>What have you done?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits.
    <br>What have you done to her career, her education?
    <br>She is so sick --- very, very sick.
    <br>She has cancer.
    <br>So you gave her cancer.
    <br>Where in the body?
    <br>She has in the cervical but they did not see that one --- I hid it.
    <br>She has in the breast.
    <br>What have you done to her family?
    <br>Her blood is infected.
    <br>What have you done to her family?
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>Who's this brother beside you ?
    <br>He's her daddy.
    <br>Sir, what can you say about your daughter?
    <br>She is my daughter and she has cancer of the breast.
    <br>This cancer runs in the family --- it killed both of my parents.
    <br>A few months ago, she too was diagnosed with cancer.
    <br>I believe it is a generational curse. Man of God, please, help us!
    <br>To God be the glory --- she is free.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Uzoamaka Akparanta.
    <br>The lady standing beside me is my mother, Elizabeth Akparanta.
    <br>We came here today to The SCOAN to testify to the goodness of God in my life.
    <br>It all started two years ago immediately after my SSCE exams.
    <br>One evening on my bed, I noticed an itchy spot at the left side of my breast.
    <br>I then scratched it but two weeks later, I noticed that it had become worse.
    <br>It wasn't healing; no matter the antibiotics or treatment I used. It just got worse.
    <br>It started expanding as well as bringing out water, blood and pus.
    <br>Four months later in December, I went to the hospital,
    <br>and the doctors told me I had cancer of the breast.
    <br>I was very sad because medically speaking, cancer has no cure.
    <br>They give you drugs only to prolong your life.
    <br>However, in my mind, I said, "Thank you, Jesus", because I knew a testimony would come from this.
    <br>When you hear the word "cancer", the first thing that comes to your mind is pain --- constant  pain.
    <br>Both day and night, I was in pain. I couldn't sleep at night.
    <br>I had to stop sleeping in the room with my mum because she would wake up in the night,
    <br>see me there  and start crying.
    <br>At a point, I had to start using breast pads because if I tried to take my bra off,
    <br>it would come off with parts of my skin, causing blood  to come out.
    <br>I couldn't wear clothes or go out under the hot sun because it made it worse.
    <br>If I stayed somewhere which was cold, it caused me this sharp pain.
    <br>I was always in constant pain.
    <br>If I was walking on the road, someone would ask me what was wrong with my clothes.
    <br>Then I would know I was stained; the breast pads could not contain it.
    <br>If I was at home, I could change ten clothes up to ten times in a day
    <br>because my skin was constantly bringing out blood and pus.
    <br>Even my bra was constantly stained with blood.
    <br>Whenever I went to the hospital, the doctors would start crying and ask why I had this at my age.
    <br>I went for chemotherapy, took drugs and injections.
    <br>There was a time they gave me this injection and at the bus company in Warri,
    <br>they refused to let me enter the bus because they said, I looked someone who was about to die.
    <br>They said, they didn't want someone to die in their bus.
    <br>We had to beg them that I would be able  to manage myself  for such a journey.
    <br>It was so bad and terrible --- the blood, the constant pain and peeling.
    <br>It wasn't getting better; it was expanding.
    <br>Every week, we would buy a carton of at least 40 breast pads.
    <br>Sometimes, I would finish them within five days; sometimes, they could last for eight days.
    <br>When I got my admission into university, I was scared to go for medical clearance
    <br>because I felt they would notice it and then defer my admission.
    <br>I was always praying and remembered something Prophet T.B Joshua said.
    <br>He said, "Whether God heals you or not, He is your Healer. He is aware of your situation.
    <br>He will not leave you without healing, prosperity and salvation".
    <br>This gave me peace of mind, that God was aware of my situation and working out my healing.
    <br>I then started the journey to look for healing.
    <br>We went to the best hospitals and clinics we could find in Delta State and across Nigeria
    <br>but we kept being referred to various other places.
    <br>We went to UPTH and Lilly Hospital get the best treatment money could afford
    <br>but they couldn't handle it.
    <br>Then, in January, I came to The SCOAN and was privileged to be prayed for by Prophet T.B Joshua.
    <br>I remember that before I came, I was watching Emmanuel TV constantly at that period.
    <br>There was a man sharing his testimony who said he saw the prophet praying for him in the dream.
    <br>I laid my hands on the television and declared my faith would carry me to the point where
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua would lay his hands on me.
    <br>I didn't care how it happened but I knew the prophet was going to lay his hands on me.
    <br>Indeed, God answered my prayer and Prophet T.B. Joshua laid his hands on me.
    <br>That night, for the first time in about eight months, I slept peacefully.
    <br>Two weeks later I was at home when I realized I had been wearing only one top all day.
    <br>When my mother came home, I told her now my breast was dry
    <br>and that I had worn the same clothes all day.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ! Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!
    <br>That is indeed a miracle and that can only happen with the help of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>Just a moment ago, we saw how the sister was placed at the prayer line -
    <br>as you can see right there.
    <br>Apart from the healing, she was also delivered from the evil spirit
    <br>that was the architect of this breast cancer in her life.
    <br>After her deliverance, she received her healing and after that moment, she said, everything changed for good.
    <br>She is happy that she is healed,
    <br>and she is here testifying to the goodness of the Lord Jesus Christ in her life.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again!
    <br>Miss Uzoamaka Akparanta & Mother (Healed of Breast Cancer)
    <br>After the prayer, I went back to the hospital.
    <br>Before then, the doctors told me my blood was contaminated with the cancer cells
    <br>and that if it wasn't drained, the cancer would spread to other parts of my body.
    <br>However, when I went back for the test, my blood came out clear,
    <br>my hormonal level was normal and everything was okay. I praise God for that!
    <br>To God be the glory. Please go to the notice board and explain what we have there.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Here is the medical report before I came to The SCOAN when I was diagnosed with breast cancer.
    <br>It's also written here that I had a fibrocystic disease.
    <br>Here, is it.
    <br>Over here is the report after I went back to the hospital.
    <br>I was told I no longer had any disorder.
    <br>You're saying, the medical report at the extreme of your left-hand side was the diagnosis of your breast cancer.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>After you came to The SCOAN, the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed over this problem
    <br>of breast cancer in your life and also delivered you.
    <br>Afterwards, you went back to the same hospital.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And what happened?
    <br>When I went back to the same hospital, they found nothing wrong with me.
    <br>In less than two months, something I thought was never possible, happened ---
    <br>my skin returned to normal as if nothing had even happened to it.
    <br>I had no scars, spots or injuries --- it cleared up as if nothing was even there in the first place.
    <br>To God be the glory. We rejoice with you greatly.
    <br>My name is Elizabeth Akparanta.
    <br>I will first thank God for giving us this great man of God in this country, Nigeria.
    <br>The lady next to me is my daughter,
    <br>Uzoamaka Akparanta.
    <br>I don't know how to appreciate God for what He did for me.
    <br>Seeing her again, healthy.
    <br>With the way it happened, I was thinking the breast would not be normal again.
    <br>Now, she is totally healed.
    <br>I thank God and the great prophet that God gave us in this country, Nigeria.
    <br>I am grateful.
    <br>How do you feel as a mother seeing your daughter healed?
    <br>I am happy but during that time, I always cried.
    <br>Every minute, I would cry and she would cry.
    <br>Now, we are happy.
    <br>We thank God.
    <br>To God be the glory. Once again, let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Uzoamaka Akparanta & Mother (Healed of Breast Cancer)
    <br>What words of advice do you have to people listening to you?
    <br>My advice to the viewers --- we should hold on to God and believe in His prophets.
    <br>It shall be well with you when you believe His prophets.
    <br>I now have faith in God.
    <br>To God be the glory. Let's hear from your daughter finally.
    <br>Miss Uzoamaka Akparanta & Mother (Healed of Breast Cancer)
    <br>You made us understand, you're perfectly healed. Please could you touch the very area where
    <br>you had the breast cancer, and tell us how you're feeling?
    <br>There is no lump, there is no pain, there is no sore.
    <br>I couldn't even touch it before.
    <br>I couldn't wear clothes or bra.
    <br>I couldn't wear black because the doctor said I shouldn't wear anything black.
    <br>Right now you're perfectly healed.
    <br>Yes, I am perfectly healed.
    <br>Having experienced the power of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, through His able servant,
    <br>Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, what is your word of advice to everyone listening to you?
    <br>My word of advice is this.
    <br>During the period I had this sickness, I didn't run from God; I was always reading and meditating
    <br>on the book 'The Mirror' and I was always watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I remember one sermon where Prophet T.B. Joshua said,
    <br>"Don't let your situation change your confession.
    <br>Whether God heals you or not, He is still your Healer.
    <br>Whether He blesses you or not, He is still your Blessing Provider".
    <br>When you are in any situation, thank God because He saw you through that situation
    <br>and He is going to give you a great testimony out of it.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God
    <br>And indeed, we're happy to hear from you, that you're fully aware
    <br>that the source of your healing is the Word of God.
    <br>To maintain this healing, you have to go and make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>As you go and do that, always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough,
    <br>the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
