    <br>Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>Malawi Vice President, Joyce Banda, Speaks On TB Joshua
    <br>Emmanuel: God is with us. Here at the Synagogue, Church of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria,
    <br>we have a wonderful visitor with us, the vice president of the Republic of Malawi, honourable Joyce Banda.
    <br>You are welcome here, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you. Amen.
    <br>Amen. For the benefit of our viewers,
    <br>we'd like to ask you to give a brief greeting to our viewers of Emmanuel TV around the world.
    <br>Hello. I am Joyce Banda and as you've already mentioned,
    <br>I'm the vice president of the Republic of Malawi.
    <br>I would like to greet all viewers of Emmanuel TV all over the world 
    <br>and to thank God for giving me an opportunity to be back, because this isn't the first time to be here.
    <br>Amen. You are very welcome, once again, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you share with us the purpose of your coming to the SCOAN to meet with Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Yes, it was in the year 2009,
    <br>my husband suffered a stroke in UK. I flew to UK to be with him in the hospital.
    <br>After one week, he was released and as you know, with stroke you have to go into rehabilitation.
    <br>But my husband suffered the most serious type which is called aphasia which means that the person doesn't talk.
    <br>Most people, often, at that point forget about ever having the opportunity to speak again.
    <br>What broke my heart was that he didn't even know my name.
    <br>My mind started racing in UK because in this job, I felt that my husband being my anchor, my best friend
    <br>and my partner - it was the time when I needed him most,
    <br>especially being elected to this position in the same year 2009.
    <br>While in UK, instead of going back home to Malawi, I decided to come straight to Nigeria.
    <br>I didn't know how to get to Prophet TB. Joshua. I didn't know anybody here.
    <br>I checked into Sheraton Hotel and started frantically trying to call any number that I could get of this place
    <br>to see if I could see prophet TB Joshua to see my husband. We finally got here, he graciously called us
    <br>and we finally got here. He prayed for my husband.
    <br>We sincerely believe and all Malawians believe that my husband had a miraculous healing,
    <br>because if you see him today, you cannot even imagine that he suffered a stroke of that kind of magnitude.
    <br>After 2 years my sister also suffered a stroke and I decided that this is the place where I should bring her.
    <br>Thirdly, I decided that I should come to thank God for the precious gift that
    <br>He has given to this continent, in the person of man of God and for all the work that he is doing.
    <br>Expecially because after our experience here with my husband, what has happened
    <br>is that we became spiritually matured and we have benefited from his continuous counsel and prayers.
    <br>Amen. We thank God Almighty for the wonderful testimonies that you have received
    <br>since you have become a viewer and then a visitor of Emmanuel TV and the Synagogue, Church of all Nations.
    <br>You mentioned, the first testimony you received was the healing of your husband who was suffering from stroke.
    <br>In fact, he was the Chief Justice of Swaziland.
    <br>He was on his way to the West Indies to attend a meeting.
    <br>So he suffered a stroke in the UK. He stayed in the UK because he couldn't travel for six weeks.
    <br>During that time, I had to wait for him in UK, but from UK, instead of flying to Malawi we flew straight here.
    <br>All right, after the prayer that he received from Prophet T.B. Joshua here at the SCOAN,
    <br>what is the condition that your husband is in now? How is he now?
    <br>My husband is perfect. In fact right now, he's playing golf. He can travel, he has travelled on his own to the US.
    <br>He can jog.
    <br>He can speak.
    <br>Yeah, we praise God for that!
    <br>That is why I definitely had to come back, but I think most importantly as a human being myself, I have been
    <br>enriched by what I have been able to learn from the man of God, what especially gets to me and what inspires me
    <br>is the work that is doing - the humanitarian work that he is doing. I have a passion for work, that supports the poor
    <br>but I think the extent to which he goes to reach out to the poor and underprivileged -
    <br>it is something that should give pride to every African that sees his work.
    <br>I have watched him and more especially,
    <br>what I have found most interesting is the way he uses the youth.
    <br>I come from a country where more than 57 percent of the population are youth.
    <br>The youth of Malawi are actively engaged in the churches Pentecostal, Muslim or ordinary churches.
    <br>And I find that they have huge interest to do more, to help, to participate in leadership,
    <br>and I think what we find here...
    <br>I've been watching, I've been here 4 days, and I've been watching all those people  - three quarters of people
    <br>that are involved in the ministry are the youth. That's what I am taking back home.
    <br>And I believe that what I can say as somebody who is in leadership,
    <br>is that all of us who are in a position of influence, all those of us who have means,
    <br>we need to do more, but in doing more we must also reach out and empower the youth.
    <br>Exactly as the Bible says that ultimately we're called to respond to all human needs, for that is what love entails.
    <br>In doing this, we should spend more on others and less on ourselves for that is the only way we can commit
    <br>more faith and love into the society of which we are a part. By doing this we inspire
    <br>not only the average individual, but the young people, the leaders and the government officials in our country
    <br>to do likewise.
    <br>In fact, if you read the Bible when Jesus Christ went out recruiting his disciples,
    <br>He went to the sea and found Simon Peter, that had fished all night but hadn't caught any fish;
    <br>Jesus Christ said: "Throw your net the other side", he tried to argue but in the end they caught so much fish
    <br>that we read in the Bible that the boat was going to sink.
    <br>And it says that they even called other people to come and share the catch.
    <br>I suppose that's what the message is because the prophet told me that this weekend
    <br>and he said something to me that is going to rest with me for the rest of my life.
    <br>He said it's a privilege. You must feel honored, you must feel it's a privilege that somebody is receiving your gift
    <br>that you're giving and instead of boasting that you are giving out, you shouldn't feel humbled
    <br>that somebody is able to receive a gift from you.
    <br>So giving in such a humble way with humility, sincerely before God -
    <br>I think is what God wants and especially from that passage that I'm talking about,
    <br>what we learn is that God has given us too much,
    <br>we need to share, we need to reach out and give to the poor and Africa has thousands and millions of people
    <br>that are living under the poverty line and those of us who are privileged, I think for us -
    <br>it's a 'must' that we must reach out and help others and that is the lesson that the man of God
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua has imparted to me and I go back home revitalized and motivated
    <br>to go out and do even more in my country.
    <br>Amen, we thank God Almighty for the wonderful lessons that you are taking back to your country from here,
    <br>the SCOAN and Prophet T.B. Joshua. We know that as children of God
    <br>we have to be examples to our fellow men and to the society at large. You mentioned that you had been
    <br>watching Emmanuel TV and this is how you came initially to bring your husband to the church for prayers.
    <br>Can you share with us, how long you've been watching Emmanuel TV and how you came to know the channel?
    <br>I come from a country that loves the man of God more than you will never be able to know from here.
    <br>In Malawi, Prophet T.B. Joshua is a person that is dearly loved. From word of mouth, people started telling me
    <br>that there is a free-to-air channel where you can watch Emmanuel TV
    <br>because in the past we used to just get one hour on our station.
    <br>From there onwards, I hooked on to Emmanuel TV. And maybe I must say I'm addicted. Because every Sunday,
    <br>I go to church. I come back and I sit all day and watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Amen, we thank God for the wonderful blessing that Emmanuel TV has done in your life.
    <br>And we pray that it'll continue to be a blessing to your life and to your loved ones.
    <br>We would like to ask you, as you are going back to your country now,
    <br>what is the message in your heart that you are taking back with you?
    <br>The message that I take back with me to Malawi is that you cannot stop praying to God for blessings,
    <br>we cannot stop praying to God to change this continent.
    <br>We cannot stop praying to God so that all the conflicts we have got on this continent should go away.
    <br>We cannot stop because when Jesus went for His last prayers on the mountain,
    <br>He left his disciples and walked away
    <br>and told them continue praying so that they would not be tempted. When He came back, He found them sleeping.
    <br>And He said: "Are you sleeping? Wake up and keep praying." I think that's what we need to do,
    <br>especially those of us who are believers. I mean I've watched Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>how he works, and I just don't know how he manages. I mean, yesterday, he blessed and he touched thousands
    <br>and thousands of people. When I had the privilege of talking to him, my question was: "How do you do it?"
    <br>But I believe, it is God who gives him that kind of strength, and I think all of us in Africa
    <br>and maybe all over the world - that's what we need to do. We need to keep in prayer.
    <br>There's so much negativity going on around the world. I think for those of us who are believers
    <br>we don't even have a choice but to pray and pray non-stop.
    <br>As Jesus said in John 17:15 that "I do not pray that You take them out of the world
    <br>but that You keep them from the evil one" and the only way that we can protect our hearts and lives and minds
    <br>from the evil one is by keeping God's Word in the midst of our heart and mouth and every conversation.
    <br>And we pray, as you do that this will become a reality and a lifestyle
    <br>to the lives of our viewers of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We'd like to ask you as you are finally going now,
    <br>what is it the message that you have for those who are watching around the world right now?
    <br>I think as Malawian, I must say first and foremost that I am very proud that I was able to come here
    <br>to share these four days with this God's family.
    <br>And I would like to say that the message that I take home is that we must continue to pray,
    <br>we must continue to do good to others, but we must also continue watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>because I have never tuned to Emmanuel TV and not get a lesson for that day.
    <br>I believe that we all start to benefit if we switch on to Emmanuel TV all the time.
    <br>Thank you very much for your comments and for your time, and we appreciate it.
    <br>You have spent a few moments with us here, at Emmanuel TV
    <br>to share your experience of your time here at the SCOAN.
    <br>And as Prophet T.B. Joshua says that better is not good enough, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Honorable Joyce Banda from Malawi.
    <br>I'm the vice president of the Republic of Malawi, and I would like to ask all viewers,
    <br>and all people of God to keep watching Emmanuel TV.
