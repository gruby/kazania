    <br>Recovering addicts sponsored by Emmanuel TV at the Lighthouse Recovery Center
    <br>We are thankful for this opportunity to be here with a very special brother.
    <br>Brother, can you first tell us your name?
    <br>Timothy.
    <br>We thank you, Emmanuel TV because this gives us the opportunity to hear from other people.
    <br>Their testimonies help reroute people who are going through rough times in life.
    <br>Brother, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
    <br>As a kid, I grew up with my grandmother and I was really sheltered.
    <br>I never even heard a curse word.
    <br>When I was 11, she passed away.
    <br>After she passed away, I had to go and live with my mother.
    <br>Living there was a total environment change.
    <br>When I opened her closet, I would see 200 to 300 pounds of drugs.
    <br>It was her husband and hers.
    <br>There were guns around and there was violence.
    <br>How old were you?
    <br>I was 11 years old.
    <br>I was scared and didn’t know how to take it – the violence at home.
    <br>I ran away the week after I turned 13.
    <br>When I ran away, it was hard.
    <br>I became a petty thief and went on to what I saw at my mother’s house – drugs.
    <br>I did a lot of things with drugs and I made an older friend.
    <br>While hanging out with him, I learned a very important lesson quickly.
    <br>That is not to judge people on the streets because it is bad.
    <br>I hung out with him for about a year and half.
    <br>I would have bet everything I had in life that he would never be violent.
    <br>One day, we were in a situation where he pulled out a gun and shot somebody in front of me.
    <br>I was wrong.
    <br>That was a lesson I learnt because I was on the streets.
    <br>After that, it became a recurring thing.
    <br>He shot so many people in front of me, I thought it was normal.
    <br>Living in that background, I thought it was legal.
    <br>I’ve got gangster tattoos all over my arms.
    <br>Somehow, I went from an inspired kid to having my motivation change; I wanted to be a gangster.
    <br>About 25, that was when I really started carrying a gun.
    <br>I actually started carrying it when I was 20 but I didn’t understand what I was doing.
    <br>When I was 25, I started putting it to work.
    <br>Friends that I knew started noticing me and what I was doing.
    <br>They came to me and wanted me to collect some money for them.
    <br>The amount I collected went up; it went up to a couple thousand dollars, then 6,000-7,000 dollars.
    <br>The next thing I knew, it was 15,000 to 50,000 dollars.
    <br>I have always been a little guy.
    <br>For me to walk up to someone and expect them to pay their debts -
    <br>they already knew that the people they were messing with were no joke.
    <br>I had to put a little more use to the gun.
    <br>So, what does that mean?
    <br>What did you end up having to do?
    <br>I shot a lot of people.
    <br>I wasn’t a killer but with my common sense, I could say that I was always smart.
    <br>Maybe I wasn’t smart at that time but I felt like I could shoot someone in the foot
    <br>to get my point across and I didn’t have to worry about anyone dying.
    <br>I would shoot them in their hand or whatever it may be.
    <br>So, that was what I started doing.
    <br>Let me ask you this; how did that affect you?
    <br>How did it come back upon you?
    <br>Did you end up facing death at some point?
    <br>Yes, over the years as my name got bigger and bigger
    <br>and I started grabbing more money for people, I ended up getting shot.
    <br>I have been shot five different times.
    <br>I got shot right between my eyes by a 9mm gun from five feet away.
    <br>You were shot by a 9mm gun right between the eyes?
    <br>Right here is where it went in.
    <br>Behind the forehead, there is a plate that protects the brain.
    <br>It went through my forehead, hit the plate, went down and broke my jaw,
    <br>went back up through my eye, shattered my eye socket and then the bullet went into my temple.
    <br>Pieces of the bullet are still in there now.
    <br>I checked out of the hospital three days later and was right back at it.
    <br>I took a bullet like a trophy.
    <br>When I set my mind on something, I went for it.
    <br>At that time, I was building a reputation; I was one of the toughest guys in the area.
    <br>The enemy would actually blind us to even death; where we not even fear death that much.
    <br>I had no fear of death; I accepted it.
    <br>I got so deep in it that I accepted it.
    <br>Tell me now what led you here to the Lighthouse.
    <br>One day, I received a letter and this letter was crystal clear.
    <br>This letter was talking about God and how good life is.
    <br>It brought me to tears.
    <br>When I got out of prison, the Lighthouse Recovery Center accepted me.
    <br>When I came here, it was hard at first to adjust
    <br>because I was coming from a circle full of very dark people.
    <br>How long have you been here?
    <br>I have been here for six and a half months now.
    <br>When I got here, I picked up the Bible and started doing one-on-one therapy.
    <br>I realised all the errors in my thinking.
    <br>I just worked really hard and now I am in leadership.
    <br>Emmanuel TV is sponsoring us here at the Lighthouse Recovery Center.
    <br>This place is changing lives.
    <br>It’s not like every other rehab or drug programme.
    <br>This one involves God and I believe that is a very important thing.
    <br>It involves God and we are recovering; all things are possible.
    <br>Recovering addicts sponsored by Emmanuel TV at the Lighthouse Recovery Center
    <br>We are here, at the Lighthouse Recovery Center.
    <br>We've got a very special brother.
    <br>This is an encouragement to all young people going through challenges.
    <br>Determination is what it takes to change your life.
    <br>Brother, tell me your name.
    <br>I'm Matthew.
    <br>I heard a very encouraging story about you.
    <br>Tell me a little bit about yourself and what led you to the Lighthouse.
    <br>When you become a part of the life of drugs and alcohol,
    <br>you find yourself walking around aimlessly.
    <br>At one point in my life, I had everything.
    <br>I had a wife; I had a son named Joshua.
    <br>All of that got taken away from me because of my choice to go to the world and do the wrong thing.
    <br>Depression really crept in and I found myself walking across intersections
    <br>because I just wanted to end my life.
    <br>I closed my eyes and just hoped that as I was walking across an intersection,
    <br>somebody would just run me over.
    <br>I did that on a daily basis.
    <br>But God didn’t allow that to happen.
    <br>I heard about the Lighthouse Recovery Center in a way that gave me hope.
    <br>I knew that if I could make it here, I could start afresh
    <br>and do something different with my life,
    <br>even though everything was taken away from me.
    <br>I had known God before and I knew He could do it again.
    <br>I knew that if I could make it here, I could breathe again.
    <br>So, what did it mean? Somebody went and picked you up, or somebody flew you out here?
    <br>Tell me what happened.
    <br>I was in Lexington, Kentucky.
    <br>I ended up in Lexington, Kentucky due to an extradition of child support -
    <br>neglecting to pay my child support.
    <br>They let me out within a week but it left me homeless in Lexington.
    <br>That was where depression really set in because I had nobody to call.
    <br>I knew if I could make it here, I would be alright.
    <br>How far is Lexington from here?
    <br>It’s about a three and a half hour car trip and I walked it.
    <br>Three and a half hour car-trip; and you walked all the way here - so it means walking...
    <br>...for 54 hours.
    <br>You walked 54 hours just to get here.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Emmanuel! God is with us!
    <br>Now, this brother is here and his life is changed.
    <br>This is the reason it is so important for us to support ministries like this.
    <br>So, Emmanuel TV and Partners, thank you for your support.
    <br>Thank you, my brother.
    <br>Emmanuel. We are still here at the Lighthouse Recovery Center.
    <br>I've got a very special guest with us right now.
    <br>I'm just going to get him to start by telling us his name, and give us a little bit of his background,
    <br>his upbringing, challenges in life, and what led him here to the Lighthouse.
    <br>First, I will start by asking your name.
    <br>Brother, what's your name?
    <br>I'm Jamie.
    <br>Where are you from?
    <br>I'm from Bloomington, Indiana.
    <br>Let us know; we know that you are here at the Lighthouse,
    <br>and we heard that you are a very important part of Lighthouse.
    <br>Can you tell us a little bit about your background, and what led you here?
    <br>In John 5, you have the man at the pool of Bethesda.
    <br>Jesus didn’t just heal the man and tell him to get up and walk
    <br>but it was very significant that He told him to take his mat and walk.
    <br>It was a symbol of what he was delivered from.
    <br>Some of the things I was delivered from and got out of,
    <br>I now lift up as a testimony of what God can deliver others from.
    <br>I grew up very roughly – in a criminal lifestyle and drug culture.
    <br>At the age of 18, I went to prison for murder.
    <br>I spent the past 23 years incarcerated for the charge of murder.
    <br>It was while incarcerated that I encountered some of the outreach ministries.
    <br>That’s how I became acquainted with the Lighthouse Recovery Center.
    <br>There are numbers of secular recovery places that deal with addiction and compulsion
    <br>but they are missing that spiritual component – that God-shaped hole.
    <br>This is that wholeness;
    <br>this is what is going to bring us back to that balance.
    <br>What would lead a person to feel like they have to defend themselves or commit murder?
    <br>I know this is a very hard question, but what would you say is the root of a problem like that?
    <br>There may be someone out there that has anger or outburst.
    <br>What would you say to them?
    <br>Because you’ve been through it and now you have come out of it
    <br>so you can help lead someone out.
    <br>I know it is a hard question but it is so real.
    <br>As a youth, I saw it in myself.
    <br>Reflecting back, I see that there are so many today that lack that soundness,
    <br>that appropriate fathering in an active sense.
    <br>They are really being fed, nurtured and reared as men in that setting.
    <br>The spiritual component is lacking.
    <br>I would say that this is where things like Christian fathering programmes, parenting programmes
    <br>and being ‘churched’ in a verb, in an action sense, being poured into and invested in -
    <br>those inadequacies – I felt and I see it in so many others, especially in our youth.
    <br>Now you were saying that when it comes to youth,
    <br>you see a lot of them trying to manoeuvre through life
    <br>and trying to make it on their own the best way they know how.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Talks To Recovering Addicts At The Lighthouse Recovery Center
    <br>Getting back to the God-shaped hole in their heart,
    <br>they are trying to take so many things from the secular world, violence and the drug culture.
    <br>It is a square peg in a round hole.
    <br>It’s not fitting; it’s not working.
    <br>We have responses like the incarceration rates, rates of addiction, suicide
    <br>and recidivism rates for people that are returning to incarceration and staying in that cycle.
    <br>This is the answer – things that are Christ-centered:
    <br>recovery from addictions; training, discipling and really fathering
    <br>from ultimate Fathering down into men, sons, women and daughters.
    <br>This is the solution.
    <br>In addition to drug addiction and alcoholism was hatred.
    <br>I was a member in a capacity of leadership for a number of years,
    <br>in the Indiana Department of Corrections with the Aryan (White) Brotherhood.
    <br>I was delivered from that in addition to addiction.
    <br>It is sin and it’s a sin that you spread and contaminate others with.
    <br>To be delivered from that, to have that lifted off,
    <br>for that weight to be gone and be replaced with love -
    <br>that stony-hard heart covered in swastikas and all this muck and mire -
    <br>to be brought up out of that and be given a heart of flesh,
    <br>to come to know God as your Father and to have an intimate relationship
    <br>as a joint heir with Christ and His Kingdom is powerful.
    <br>This is more than just delivery from drugs.
    <br>This is deliverance; this is freedom.
    <br>This is what true power in love looks like in the flesh.
    <br>The Lighthouse Recovery Center is a place where great things have been going on.
    <br>We have a very special brother here who we partnered with.
    <br>We hosted a Back-To School Block Party and give-away.
    <br>Josh, tell us some of the things that we gave away at the block party.
    <br>Shoes, backpacks, food and T-shirts.
    <br>You allowed me to be a blessing and hand out to these children.
    <br>I had some kids crying because they have never received designer shoes in their life.
    <br>I was able to donate them and kids loved them.
    <br>Their response was great!
    <br>We all know how important those items are, especially to young children coming up in school.
    <br>I mean, the peer pressure and everything.
    <br>I went to a big city school and I’ve seen kids get their stuff taken from them.
    <br>Seeing these kids appreciate it like that – it is a gift from God.
    <br>Thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to feel that kind of blessing.
    <br>We would like to thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Partners because you allow us to continue to help.
    <br>Here is our donation of $3,500 towards this ministry.
    <br>That is why it is so important for you to continue to give so that we can continue to help
    <br>The Lighthouse Recovery Center because they are reaching people and changing lives.
    <br>Our slogan is changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.
    <br>We can do these types of things together.
    <br>Just tell us how many men are here.
    <br>Between our two facilities, we have about 87 men.
    <br>We have about 40-45 women at the women’s facility.
    <br>We have transitional housing which I do not have those exact numbers for.
    <br>Those are for graduates as they leave the programme, to help them stay plugged in
    <br>because people are a lot more successful if they stay plugged into the ministry once they graduate.
    <br>We are trying to expand that and get more transitional housing for them
    <br>because right now, we don’t have enough for the amount of people we have.
    <br>We are trying to expand that; we are trying to grow
    <br>and with the way Emmanuel TV is helping us, we are going to keep going in the right direction.
    <br>Remember, we are changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.
