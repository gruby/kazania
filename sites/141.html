  <p>    
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Have you thrown this thing away?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>You have to throw it away.
    <br>God loves you so much.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Deliverance Time
    <br>As Wise Man Christopher moves throughout the congregation,
    <br>he touches each and every one of those in attendance.
    <br>The touch they are receiving is not just an ordinary touch, it is a touch of Jesus Christ,
    <br>that will dispel every shade of darkness in their lives.
    <br>As he is praying the prayer of faith, a woman from the next row steps forward
    <br>and addresses Wise Man Christopher.
    <br>Moving closer and closer with every word, she clenches her hands in the fist
    <br>and her stance is that of someone who is ready to fight.
    <br>She moves towards the wise man with every intention of fighting him.
    <br>Let us see what happens next in her encounter with Wise Man Christopher.
    <br>What do you want from me?
    <br>You small boy, you don’t have respect for old mothers like me.
    <br>What do you want from me?
    <br>Please, leave me alone.
    <br>I don’t want anything to disturb me.
    <br>Leave me alone.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>You want to know who I am?
    <br>I am the queen of the world.
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>I am the queen of the world.
    <br>Can't you see?
    <br>I am the queen of the world.
    <br>OK?
    <br>As a queen, how do you operate in this body?
    <br>I seduce people.
    <br>Both men and women.
    <br>Do you know what she is doing?
    <br>She is a mobile cashier.
    <br>I entered her through the internet when she opened her profile.
    <br>I saw a bright star in her and I entered her.
    <br>I gave her this ring and this mirror.
    <br>Where is the mirror?
    <br>Can't you find the mirror there?
    <br>There is a mirror which I use to monitor her all around.
    <br>What did you say?
    <br>She told me today that someone on the internet sent her to buy these things.
    <br>So, she bought them.
    <br>The person told her what and where to buy these things.
    <br>So, she went and bought them.
    <br>What do you say - what this is all about?
    <br>It is to seduce people.
    <br>I seduce great people.
    <br>People that are trying to make it, I bring them down.
    <br>Do you know what happened?
    <br>As a cashier, we gave her perfume we saw on the internet.
    <br>It is a body spray.
    <br>When she sprays it and you are her customer, you will smell it from a distance.
    <br>Then, you will remove whatever you have sold, whatever you have in your pocket and give her.
    <br>Immediately.
    <br>What are you saying, sir?
    <br>Even inside this bag, there is perfume.
    <br>Everywhere she is going – perfume.
    <br>Even if you take her inside a car, she will spray perfume.
    <br>She takes it everywhere.
    <br>Each time you spray this demonic perfume - what happens?
    <br>How do you use them?
    <br>I seduce more customers, as a giant queen of the world.
    <br>When you seduce these people - what happens to them?
    <br>I have many, many branches and she is the only one collecting money for us.
    <br>When she collects it, I bring it.
    <br>Once she has collected 1 000 Francs from you, we will collect millions of dollars and pounds from you
    <br>and everything about you is finished; you will never make it in life.
    <br>She has captured many.
    <br>We have millions of dollars in our kingdom brought by her.
    <br>How does she capture these people?
    <br>Explain.
    <br>She captures them with the perfume.
    <br>Every time she goes out, she sprays.
    <br>They will say, "Oh, our girl has come. We were waiting for you.
    <br>We just perceived the smell of your perfume."
    <br>Everybody will remove their money and give her.
    <br>But here she is; we collect everything from her.
    <br>And this mirror is to monitor her everywhere she is going.
    <br>How many of you are living in this body?
    <br>Five of us.
    <br>Mention your names one after the other.
    <br>Who is number one?
    <br>The queen.
    <br>Number two?
    <br>The idols.
    <br>Number three?
    <br>The lion.
    <br>Number four?
    <br>The snake.
    <br>Number five?
    <br>I will not say it.
    <br>Number five.
    <br>I will not say it.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ - speak.
    <br>Number five?!
    <br>Anger.
    <br>How do you operate in this body?
    <br>Who do you mean, the queen or the idols?
    <br>The one who is allowed to talk.
    <br>How do you people operate in this body?
    <br>I, the idol, have destroyed the whole family.
    <br>No one can make it in that family.
    <br>This one wants to show me she can make it
    <br>but I told her she will not make it; she can't.
    <br>She will not make it in that family.
    <br>She cannot make it.
    <br>Many of them are running mental.
    <br>This one wants to show me she knows that Man.
    <br>Who is that Man to her?
    <br>What are you trying to do?
    <br>I am ready for the fight.
    <br>You are ready for what?
    <br>For the fight!
    <br>You are ready for what?
    <br>For the fight!
    <br>Why are you provoking me?
    <br>You were talking about some Man.
    <br>Who were you referring to?
    <br>Which Man are you talking about!?
    <br>That Man – you know Him; you know that Man.
    <br>Please, don’t look at me.
    <br>Your eyes...
    <br>You know, as I am a queen, you don’t have to look straight forward like that.
    <br>Your eyes are affecting me.
    <br>How does it affect you?
    <br>Too much fire.
    <br>As an idol, what have you done to members of the family of this lady?
    <br>I have rendered them useless; no one can give an account of anything.
    <br>Do you know why?
    <br>The father dedicated her to me.
    <br>When the mother gave birth to her, I saw the bright future in her head
    <br> and I asked for her as a favour from the father and he accepted.
    <br>That's why she has to come back to serve me.
    <br>She says she is a born-again.
    <br>Born to where?
    <br>She has to come back and give me a sacrifice.
    <br>What kind of sacrifice?
    <br>As usual, she will give me goats and blood because I need blood to live.
    <br>What kind of blood do you need?
    <br>Animal blood, human blood – I need it to live.
    <br>I destroyed the son.
    <br>I gave her last son the spirit of sickle cell.
    <br>Each time that child fails, they will remove blood from this one,
    <br>this useless thing and give to him, which I don’t like.
    <br>They will do what?
    <br>They will remove her blood and give to him.
    <br>That's what I need from her so that she will come back and serve me.
    <br>Do you get it?
    <br>What have you done to this lady's marriage?
    <br>I have destroyed everything about that marriage.
    <br>The husband – I rendered him useless.
    <br>For three years, he has been doing nothing.
    <br>This useless thing thinks she can make it.
    <br>She will not make it.
    <br>How have you destroyed his job?
    <br>I have destroyed him.
    <br>Nobody gives him a contract.
    <br>When they promise to give him a contract, I will go there and stop the people.
    <br>When he goes there, they will jail him and say he is a fake man.
    <br>OK?
    <br>It is so that this one will suffer and come back to me but she said that she would not.
    <br>I have captured the rest of the members of the family but this one is stubborn.
    <br>She escaped from me.
    <br>I have rendered those people useless.
    <br>But this one is brighter and she told me she would not bow her knees before me.
    <br>But I said it before my idol kingdom that this girl will return.
    <br>Where is your kingdom?
    <br>My kingdom is in the father's house.
    <br>We have many people we have captured there.
    <br>Nine of them have been captured.
    <br>We rendered them mental.
    <br>Do you know the uncle is a principal?
    <br>We brought him back to nothing.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, I found myself here.
    <br>I am disgraced!
    <br>My kingdom will fall; I have many branches all over.
    <br>Right now, anything that has a beginning must have an end.
    <br>I plead with you.
    <br>Please, leave...
    <br>You have no option.
    <br>Leave her for me, please.
    <br>You have no option.
    <br>Your mission has come to an end.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of this body!
    <br>All over your body - Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Every part of your body!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire - in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Why are you doing this to me?
    <br>My company will fall.
    <br>Every part of your body!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Would you now leave me alone?
    <br>Right now, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ - go.
    <br>Do you want to fight?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, come.
    <br>I can't go there, it is too much fire.
    <br>I can't stand.
    <br>What did you say?
    <br>There is too much fire - I can't cross.
    <br>But you want to fight?
    <br>You people collected all our powers.
    <br>We cannot see or fight.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of her!
    <br>Out!
    <br>You demon.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>You are delivered.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>I am happy to see you, sir.
    <br>Rise up, stand up.
    <br>Have you sent me out of the captives' hands?
    <br>Am I free?
    <br>What do you mean? You said you were...
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Do you remember what you have said?
    <br>No.
    <br>Jesus has delivered you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Follow Him.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>OK. Let me just pick it one by one.
    <br>It talked about the perfume.
    <br>That does not mean that the perfume is bad.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Everything has old and new – the old nature and the new nature.
    <br>Everything.
    <br>Even your suit, there is a fake and a genuine one.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Everything.
    <br>Satan is trying to copy.
    <br>Fake people are trying to copy.
    <br>Like I was telling you people about:
    <br>The old nature demands to see because he lives by the senses.
    <br>There is a conflict between the old nature and the new nature.
    <br>There is what?
    <br>There is a conflict between the old nature and the new nature.
    <br>The old nature demands to see because he lives by the senses.
    <br>If you say you must see before you believe - this is a problem for you -
    <br>you will continue to be trapped by satan.
    <br>You will continue to be trapped by what?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you say you must see before you believe, you are trapped."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We do not see first, then believe.
    <br>We believe first, then see.
    <br>I have given you the message today, which is going to work for you.
    <br>Because you want to see, what you can see with your eyes.
    <br>This contradicts our natural way of thinking.
    <br>The world at large says 'seeing is believing'
    <br>- and they will show you how things work -
    <br>'seeing is believing'. But the Bible reverses the order - we must believe, then see.
    <br>So the perfume it talks about...
    <br>It does not mean that all the perfume...
    <br>In everything, there is positive and negative.
    <br>There are the old nature and the new nature.
    <br>Let's listen to her.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>[God with us.]
    <br>My name is Ngwenye Prudentia, I am coming from Cameroon.
    <br>The man beside me is my lovely husband.
    <br>The man beside him is my brother and my son.
    <br>I'm here to testify to the goodness of God, for what Lord has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in my life.
    <br>I was having nightmares.
    <br>It all started when I wanted to do an American visa lottery for my daughter which I went to the internet for
    <br>and I asked my nephew to open a Facebook account for me.
    <br>He did it.
    <br>We played the lottery.
    <br>After that, I opened my Facebook profile and I saw somebody requested to be my friend.
    <br>I accepted him as my friend.
    <br>Anytime I would go to the internet, he was always online.
    <br>When I asked him where he was from, he said he was from America.
    <br>I told him that I had some problems and I wanted him to help me.
    <br>He asked me what type of problem.
    <br>I said financial problems.
    <br>He said OK, he would do that.
    <br>He said he would send something to me.
    <br>When I went to my Facebook profile the next day, I saw an amount of money.
    <br>I asked him if he was the one who sent me the money.
    <br>He said yes.
    <br>I asked him how I was going to collect this money.
    <br>And you didn’t know him?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>He said he was sent to indicate to me how to collect the money.
    <br>When I got there the next day, I saw a file with certain articles
    <br>and a note indicating where I could buy those articles, which I did.
    <br>I went directly to the store in Cameroon and bought those articles.
    <br>After buying the articles, I went back to Facebook.
    <br>I told him that I had bought those things.
    <br>He said I should send him my account number so that he could deposit the money into my account.
    <br>I asked if I could ask him a question and he said yes.
    <br>I told him that it was good that he wanted to help me but I would want to know his name and see his picture.
    <br>He said, the next morning he would do everything possible to send his picture.
    <br>The next day, I went to check for his name and his picture, with my daughter.
    <br>My daughter opened the file.
    <br>People of God, I saw something I had never seen in my life.
    <br>I was shocked – I even fainted there.
    <br>This is what I saw in my Facebook profile – this picture with no name.
    <br>I was shocked.
    <br>I didn’t know how to explain it and nobody knew about it.
    <br>You have never discussed this with anyone?
    <br>No.
    <br>What about your husband standing there?
    <br>He doesn’t know anything about it.
    <br>Yey!
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>The husband says that he sees it for the first time.
    <br>The husband is on the floor.
    <br>I'm finished.
    <br>You are finished?
    <br>Man of God, I'm finished!
    <br>I stay in the same house with her but I've never seen this before.
    <br>Man of God, help me! I'm finished!
    <br>You see it for the first time?
    <br>Yes, I'm finished!
    <br>This is my first time seeing this, Man of God.
    <br>Even the ring that she was showing – I have never seen it before.
    <br>You have never seen the ring before?
    <br>The ring. Yes.
    <br>You see the ring for the first time?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Let me ask the wife.
    <br>Madam, did they ask you not to tell anyone?
    <br>Yes, sir. They said it was a covenant and I should not tell anybody.
    <br>He said I made a covenant with him and I have to work for him.
    <br>Let's see the picture again.
    <br>After you saw this picture and the ring, what started to happen to you?
    <br>When I saw this picture, he came to me in my dream that very night
    <br>and told me that I had made a covenant with him, I belonged to his kingdom and would work for him.
    <br>He said those articles I bought were for seduction - both men and women.
    <br>The man came to you in the dream?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>How does he look like?
    <br>He's a very giant, tall man.
    <br>And you have never seen him physically before?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>Look, we are addressing the whole world now.
    <br>People don't know these kinds of things happen.
    <br>From which country is the person who sent you the picture?
    <br>He said he was from America.
    <br>I just saw this picture but no name.
    <br>The day you received the picture, he came to you in the dream.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Tell us what he told you when he came to you in the dream.
    <br>He came to me in my dream and said I belonged to him,
    <br>I had made a covenant with him and would work in his kingdom.
    <br>He told me the articles he gave me were for seducing men and women.
    <br>Immediately, I started hearing a certain voice talking to me.
    <br>What were the voices telling you?
    <br>The voice said that before I would go to my job, I must use this spray.
    <br>Since then, I had never done anything without the spray.
    <br>I could not do without this spray – I would buy it in the packet.
    <br>Every morning before I went to my job, I would spray this perfume.
    <br>What happened when you sprayed it?
    <br>My customers would already know that I was coming.
    <br>When I asked how they knew I was coming, they said they could smell my perfume.
    <br>I'm a "daily collector".
    <br>What was this thing used for?
    <br>The ring is used for seducing great men and women.
    <br>And you succeeded in seducing many great men?
    <br>Yes, thousands of them.
    <br>When you seduced them, they would go out with you?
    <br>Some of them would go out with me and immediately they did that,
    <br>they were finished and would never give account of anything in life.
    <br>She is free now.
    <br>The battle is for Jesus.
    <br>God is using me to fight the whole world that is negative.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you know that this picture is a symbol of "trillions" of people all over the world who worship these things?
    <br>Trillions of people are under the influence of this thing.
    <br>It is like we are fighting trillions of people all over the world.
    <br>They have devoured thousands of people.
    <br>All they are interested in is to bring you down and turn you to slaves or dogs.
    <br>The husband did not know what was happening in the house.
    <br>Aren't you surprised about that ring?
    <br>You said that many heroes and great men you had got and brought down?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>When I sprayed this perfume, before I would get to you, you would already know that I was coming.
    <br>When I got there, the customers would tell me they knew I was coming.
    <br>When I asked how they knew, they would say they could smell my spray
    <br>and wanted to know the name and where to get it.
    <br>I gave some of them the name and directed them where to get it.
    <br>The next day, when that man came to carry me to that kingdom,
    <br>I would see some of those people there.
    <br>Anyone that used this spray would be initiated.
    <br>We all need deliverance.
    <br>Look at the husband.
    <br>He is surprised.
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>Madam, it is all right.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>People of God, help me to say thank you to the man of God.
    <br>This woman has destroyed me.
    <br>Any contract I touch – nothing can progress.
    <br>Making love with her is a problem.
    <br>When I make love with her – if I have any appointment tomorrow, it vanishes.
    <br>Everything is finished, right down to the house.
    <br>Nothing is finished. It is all right.
    <br>I want to join your family.
    <br>Help me to beg my husband, that he would forgive me.
    <br>No, don't worry. I'm going to see the two of you.
