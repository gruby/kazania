  <p>    
    <br>The world today, they don't understand what we call 'peace of heart'.
    <br>If anything exchanged from him to me, in terms of money,
    <br>before he received this blessing and healing,
    <br>one will be a partaker of that sickness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Did you listen to me?
    <br>But people don't know that like someone who is in need of rescue, sickness,
    <br>and you now use that opportunity to collect something -
    <br>you know, at that time, he is ready to give you anything, he is ready to give you money -
    <br>and you now say, before you do this, you need this,
    <br>and you use whatever you collected there -
    <br>it always goes with the spirit of affliction he has
    <br>because he is not going to give anything at that time with all his heart.
    <br>He is giving it because of the problem he has.
    <br>Anything that does not come from one's heart is a sin.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Whatever that is not coming from my heart is a sin".
    <br>Can you see the life you are living?
    <br>If you help me and that help is not from your heart, it is a sin.
    <br>It means, you commit sin and I that receive it too, I receive sin.
    <br>If you help me now and that help is not from your heart,
    <br>I that help you, I commit sin; you that receive that, you commit sin.
    <br>If you now give me money and it is not from your heart,
    <br>you are giving me affliction.
    <br>I that give you - affliction; you that receive it - affliction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sit down; go and have your seat. I will see you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He is giving me that affliction he has.
    <br>Can you imagine the life we are living today
    <br>and most especially, we ministers of God?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We ministers of God - can you see the challenges we are facing?
    <br>It has been stated - the manner we must receive and the manner we must give.
    <br>There is no excuse that, "Ah, I must buy fuel, I must pay electricity,
    <br>I must take care of the ministry, I need money to do that". 
    <br>But...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So with this, if you now look at this procedure,
    <br>you can separate the wheat from the chaff, the real from fake.
    <br>It is easy to separate in the house of God.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Fake and real is easy to separate in the church of God.
    <br>By this statement God has given, "Freely I give and freely you should give" -
    <br>can separate the fake from the real.
    <br>Say it to your neighbour.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Freely I give you and freely you should give.
    <br>That statement separates fake from real.
    <br>This statement is a simple statement.
    <br>The Bible has stated it clearly.
    <br>Freely I give you and freely you should give.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>The Lord is our strength, and money comes from our strength.
    <br>Fame comes from our strength.
    <br>Whatever you need comes from our strength and the Lord is our strength.
    <br>For one to say, "In the name of Jesus" and for Jesus to come to the scene,
    <br>that "In the name of Jesus" must come from your heart.
    <br>How many of you speak from your heart?
    <br>That is it.
    <br>And when you say, "In the name of Jesus" and it is from your heart,
    <br>the job is half done.
    <br>Here Jesus comes in to bring balance
    <br>and the balance is for him to come to the scene.
    <br>"I'm here. What do you want me to do?"
    <br>"Healing and..."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How do we speak this, "In the name of Jesus" that comes from our heart?
    <br>When you say, "In the name of Jesus", you mean your total support, total reliance, total belief.
    <br>Today, yesterday and forever.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Jesus is not just now.
    <br>When you stand before Him, He demands for now and He demands for your future.
    <br>When you are now telling Him, "Jesus, help me",
    <br>He will say, "If I help you, you will follow Me".
    <br>To follow Him is for your future.
    <br>He is interested in your future, tomorrow.
    <br>You say, "Jesus, heal me"
    <br>and He will say, "Ok, I will heal you; you will follow Me".
    <br>This is what He said:
    <br>I will make you fishers of men
    <br>If you follow Me
    <br>This is just it.
    <br>That is, if you speak your heart, I will make you a fisher of men.
    <br>"Help me" - it must come from your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you say, "Help me", it means, 'help me for the rest of my life';
    <br>it means, 'I will follow You".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Speaking what is in our heart, the job is half done -
    <br>here Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look at him, look at our brother here.
    <br>Speaking what is in your heart can also help you to maintain your healing.
    <br>For him to maintain this healing, what he says to Jesus must come from his heart.
    <br>So you need maintenance and the One that gives you must maintain it for you.
    <br>It is not possible for me to give you this...
    <br>If I give you this and someone else will come and help you how to treat it, it is not making sense.
    <br>I that gives you must also tell you how to use it.
    <br>That is maintenance.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What are you doing? What are you saying?
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>You  may be seated.
