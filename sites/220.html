    <br>Wise Man Racine prays for the people at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations prayer line.
    <br>Under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit, the people fall under the anointing of God.
    <br>Every shade of affliction in their lives is dispelled in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>He continues to stretch forth his hand and declares the people free.
    <br>As Wise Man Racine continues to pray, he encounters this young man -
    <br>who with just a touch begins to manifest.
    <br>Let's see how he was delivered.
    <br>Who are you?!
    <br>Speak louder! Speak out!
    <br>I finished him.
    <br>You finished him?
    <br>No education.
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>He lusts after women; women is all he knows.
    <br>He loves to party, drink and do drugs; he is finished.
    <br>Speak louder!
    <br>I need him; don't deliver him.
    <br>You need him to do what? Explain!
    <br>Porn; he is addicted to women, drugs, just name them.
    <br>I just need him, please.
    <br>How do you control him?
    <br>He thinks he is done smoking, drinking and getting tattoos.
    <br>How many?
    <br>He has up to seven.
    <br>Seven tattoos?
    <br>Where are they located?
    <br>On his body.
    <br>On his body?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What's the purpose of these tattoos? Explain!
    <br>I gave him the addiction for it.
    <br>Anywhere he sees tattoos, he just falls in love with them.
    <br>No matter what, he has to get them.
    <br>Any tattoos he sees, he has to get them.
    <br>He gets tattoos?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He just wants to get tattoos all over his body.
    <br>I need him.
    <br>He needs to get more. I need him for a special tattoo he is going to get.
    <br>He is going to get a special tattoo for me; don't deliver him.
    <br>What special tattoo?
    <br>This is just the beginning.
    <br>Show me the special tattoo.
    <br>He is going to get that one on his back.
    <br>He does not have it yet but he is going to get it.
    <br>Wings – I am a fallen angel so I have to get my wings to fly back.
    <br>He is finished.
    <br>How many demonic powers do you have?
    <br>How many? Speak louder!
    <br>If girls see him, they cannot take their eyes off of him.
    <br>He loves to display his tattoos; that is what he gets them for.
    <br>When they see him and his tattoos, they cannot resist him.
    <br>So, when they see his tattoos, nobody can resist him?
    <br>No.
    <br>What happened to those people?
    <br>You mean the girls?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Definitely, he is going to have sex with them.
    <br>Even in the clubs, he gets them
    <br>and he is going to sleep with every one of them.
    <br>That is how we do it.
    <br>What have you done to the family?
    <br>The family - they are in confusion.
    <br>Confusion?
    <br>You can ask the parents; nobody stays with them any longer.
    <br>I am the only one who wants to stay with them
    <br>and I am even forcing myself to stay with them.
    <br>I don't even want to stay with them
    <br>because they don't allow me to do the things I want to do -
    <br>like going after girls, going to clubs, drinking and smoking.
    <br>I miss that life.
    <br>Who is this man next to you? Open your eyes!
    <br>I can't open my eyes.
    <br>Who is this man on your left?!
    <br>I can't.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome.
    <br>Who is this boy?
    <br>He is the last-born in the family.
    <br>Your last-born?
    <br>I just got him and satan took over the boy.
    <br>After two years in the university, he ran away.
    <br>What can you say about his life, his confession?
    <br>Honestly, this boy is finished. He drinks, womanises and takes drugs.
    <br>See his arms - and it is all over his body.
    <br>I had to catch him to bring him here.
    <br>God Almighty has heard my prayers.
    <br>Madam, who is this boy?
    <br>My last-born.
    <br>What can you say about his lifestyle?
    <br>There is nothing to write home about him; he is somebody who is finished.
    <br>There is no business. In school, he cannot make it and he is very stubborn.
    <br>He does not respect his senior ones or even his parents.
    <br>Welcome, brother. What can you say about him?
    <br>In short, he disgraces everybody in the family; he does not do anything.
    <br>He doesn’t respect his senior ones; he ran away from school and quit everything.
    <br>He womanises and has tattoos all over his body. He goes clubbing.
    <br>It entered his head just like that.
    <br>You demon, how did you enter him?
    <br>I saw him right from birth, that he was going to serve my purpose -
    <br>confusion, anger, lust, limitation, setback, just name them.
    <br>The family is in shambles; there is nothing.
    <br>None of the sons can provide anything or even own a car,
    <br>talk less of feeding their parents; they are all broke.
    <br>Even the sisters' marriages are rubbish.
    <br>Of course, you know who did it.
    <br>Who did it?!
    <br>You know.
    <br>You demon, wicked spirit - Jesus has come to set this man free.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, come out!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, you wicked demon!
    <br>Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire on these demonic tattoos.
    <br>Fire all over your body.
    <br>Every demonic power - be consumed.
    <br>Out, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Come out, you demon.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. All over your body and your hands.
    <br>Fire! Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>Do you remember what you have said?
    <br>Look here. Is he your dad?
    <br>Yes and that is my mum and my senior sister.
    <br>Jesus has cast out that demon, evil spirit, that caused him to misbehave. He is free.
    <br>Please - do not remind him of his past. His past is over.
    <br>Jesus has set you free. Go and follow Him. In Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. My family is free.
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ben Ezenwata. I am from Imo State, but I reside in Togo with my family.
    <br>The people standing with me here are my brothers, sisters and parents -
    <br>this is my dad, mum and senior sisters and brothers.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>was possession of an evil spirit – a fallen angel.
    <br>The fallen angel exposed me to various bad habits, such as clubbing,
    <br>taking drugs, drinking, smoking and getting tattoos all over my body.
    <br>It all started when I was a kid and it has been like that ever since.
    <br>It was because of the way I was brought up by my family and relatives around me.
    <br>I was not getting that much love and attention,
    <br>so I grew up becoming a sadist and emotionalist.
    <br>That was my experience.
    <br>The devil used that as a medium to get into me and
    <br>to get me exposed to various bad habits which I was delivered from by Wise Man Racine.
    <br>You said that you were possessed by the spirit of a fallen angel.
    <br>Could you just explain: how did this demon enter your body and what was his mission in your life?
    <br>The way this demon entered was through my exposure to the internet,
    <br>movies, music and so much worldly stuff that happened around me.
    <br>These were the mediums it used to get into me.
    <br>The way this demon looked was half human, half animal.
    <br>Getting into me, it made me to know various bad habits and my upbringing too was not that good.
    <br>I was taking various kinds of drugs because that was what the demon compelled me to do.
    <br>When it compels you, you do whatever it tells you to do because you are not in control of yourself anymore;
    <br>you do whatever the demon tells you to do.
    <br>That was how I was exposed to the urge to smoke, lust after women, getting tattoos
    <br>and taking all kinds of drugs.
    <br>It really damaged me academically and in my family life.
    <br>It really damaged all aspects of my life because
    <br>nobody wanted to be close to me because of disrespect and various things in my family.
    <br>It used me as a medium to get into my family and caused more damage.
    <br>You said that this demon would appear to you in the form of a half-human, half-creature.
    <br>What were the things it would be telling you to do and how did it appear to you before your deliverance?
    <br>The way this demon appeared to me was when I had taken drugs and listened to music.
    <br>When I got high, as the result of an overdose, I could stay for days without eating.
    <br>I listened to worldly music and through that, they came into contact with me
    <br>and told me what to do through this trance when I was high.
    <br>What were the type of things these demons were instructing you to do?
    <br>The type of stuff it told me to do was to take drugs, go clubbing, be disrespectful and to be idle.
    <br>It got to an extent that I was addicted to the internet so much.
    <br>I had an addiction to watching porn and looking at nude pictures on the internet.
    <br>It used this as a medium to get to me.
    <br>It told me to do more of those stuffs like masturbation and various bad habits I was being possessed with.
    <br>It told me to do more of those stuffs and compelled me to get tattoos that would deceive people.
    <br>The tattoos were not really what they meant.
    <br>When you saw the tattoos, you would think that they were really just tattoos but they were not.
    <br>So, these were the kind of stuffs the demons were telling me to do when I was in a trance with them.
    <br>Our brother is mentioning some tattoos.
    <br>For the glory of God - could you just show us on your body the tattoos you are talking about?
    <br>You said that specifically this demon used these tattoos as a form of deception,
    <br>to deceive people to think that they are just ordinary, whereas in actual fact,
    <br>they were something much more than that - a means of initiation.
    <br>We just want you to show us these tattoos.
    <br>We are asking these questions so that we can learn from our brother's experiences,
    <br>and I believe viewers around the world are learning many lessons.
    <br>Just explain to us the tattoo that we are seeing here.
    <br>The tattoo you are seeing here is the head of Jesus.
    <br>It reads "Dieu pardonne moi" - "God forgive me" in French.
    <br>This is just a means of letting people out there feel that it is religious, whereas it is not.
    <br>It is just a mark the evil spirits are using.
    <br>Their agents out there – they are tattooists.
    <br>Wherever you see a tattooist and you know it is not just ordinary tattoos,
    <br>they are agents who the devil sent out to put these marks on youth.
    <br>Whenever you see a youth with a tattoo, he is being marked.
    <br>Unless he gets his deliverance from the mark of the devil on him,
    <br>he will be tormented throughout his youthful life.
    <br>So, this tattoo we are seeing is one of the many on your body that is a camouflage, a deception.
    <br>People think it is just a religious icon, but in fact it is a means of an initiation, and a mark from satan.
    <br>These various tattoos you are seeing on my body are a camouflage.
    <br>There was a special one, a fallen angel; he needed his wings to fly back.
    <br>He was saying that in order for him to get those wings, he needed those marks to be on me.
    <br>I was going to get the tattoo of wings on my back – very huge wings.
    <br>In order for him to get his wings back, he was going to get that through me by placing his mark on my back.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for our brother's confession.
    <br>We believe that there are many valuable lessons that we are learning from this.
    <br>Brother, you were talking about the worldly media that you were engaged in,
    <br>for example, using the internet, listening to worldly music, playing video games.
    <br>Could you explain to us - what were the negative repercussions these were having on your life,
    <br>and how was satan using these instruments to really infiltrate your life
    <br>and indeed the lives of youth around the world?
    <br>The means through which this evil spirit gets into contact with the youth
    <br>are through the internet and movies.
    <br>It is mostly through the internet.
    <br>I got it as a result of going online to do all those kind of things -
    <br>to download some music and look at nude pictures.
    <br>So many youth out there are being enticed with this;
    <br>they get initiated and don't know what comes over them.
    <br>They see themselves doing things they did not know they would do.
    <br>That is how it takes control over them.
    <br>We believe that youth around the world and people here are really listening to our brother.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that today he is here in The SCOAN.
    <br>Tell us brother, what happened when you came to The SCOAN a couple of weeks ago
    <br>and received prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Coming here – you can ask my parents – was against my will.
    <br>They had to force me to come here and they even had to force me to start watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I always felt that there was something about this place that I did not want to be part of.
    <br>Finally, I came here on the 29th of September with my parents.
    <br>I was not even expecting it.
    <br>When we went on the prayer line, Wise Man Racine touched me
    <br>and that was where I blacked out and lost memory.
    <br>The next thing I found out was me standing up from the ground.
    <br>We can see on the screen here how our brother was being delivered last weekend.
    <br>Tell us, for the glory of God - ever since your deliverance, just testify; what are the changes in your life?
    <br>You said before you were addicted to taking drugs, smoking, drinking alcohol, womanizing,
    <br>you were addicted to the internet.
    <br>Tell us the changes in your life for the last two weeks, since this deliverance.
    <br>It has been fantastic and wonderful because getting out of that life is what I had wanted.
    <br>Finally, being free from the evil spirit has been a wonderful and fantastic experience to me
    <br>because I see myself doing things I couldn’t do before.
    <br>Now, I listen to Gospel music, read the Bible and pray a lot.
    <br>I see myself being free from all those things and the urge is gone.
    <br>I don’t have lust for women or an urge to smoke or take drugs.
    <br>I don’t have the urge to listen to worldly music or even movies or looking at nude pictures.
    <br>I am completely free now and born-again. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ for our brother's deliverance.
    <br>We thank Jesus Christ. And finally, what is your advice to people around the world,
    <br>and especially to young people now, that you are delivered? What is your advice?
    <br>My advice to the world and the viewers out there goes mainly to the parents.
    <br>Parents need to be part and partakers of the upbringing of their children,
    <br>not just giving birth to them and then thinking they are OK.
    <br>There are things out there right now because the devil uses any means
    <br>he can lay his hands on to get people to himself and to get people to darkness.
    <br>They use these means as a medium to get a contact to the family
    <br>to cause confusion and other terrible things to the family.
    <br>My advice goes to parents out there.
    <br>They need to be connected to their kids.
    <br>They need to know how their kids are doing and go to places that their kids go to.
    <br>I would like to thank God that He used this as a medium to touch my family
    <br>because you can see us that we are all smiling, we are all happy, but this was not how it was before.
    <br>For the past 22 years of my existence, this is not how it had been.
    <br>This is the very first time, for the past 22 years of my existence,
    <br>that the family has come together, being one and everyone is here, complete.
    <br>It is a thing of joy for me because it is something I had been praying for.
    <br>I thank God that it has finally been fulfilled in my life.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Our brother said that for the first time in 22 years we can see the family together as one,
    <br>as a result of his deliverance; we rejoice with this family.
    <br>Time will not permit us to listen to the family members
    <br>because we still have so many people waiting to testify.
    <br>We just want to encourage this family, now that deliverance has come to your home,
    <br>continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and indeed the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
