    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Every constant experience you are having of that bondage,
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua leads the mass prayer at The SCOAN
    <br>and every poisonous substance stored in the bodies of the people are flushed out, in Jesus name.
    <br>As the congregation engages in prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>this lady wearing white is brought out and she begins to manifest in a peculiar manner.
    <br>Let's watch what happens.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am the serpent of Nembe kingdom.
    <br>Her forefathers have a covenant with me.
    <br>Who dare come to my territory?
    <br>Walk and let me see.
    <br>She said she is a general.
    <br>She said who can deliver her?
    <br>You come to my kingdom and ask them, "Who is the...?"
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>The serpent of Nembe kingdom.
    <br>My people dance.
    <br>Dance and let us see.
    <br>POSSESSED By Dancing SERPENT Spirit!
    <br>When I came into this place, I said, "There is a God here."
    <br>- There is what?
    <br>- God.
    <br>But I said, "I won't let her go."
    <br>Yes, I made a covenant with my kingdom.
    <br>This lady trespassed when she took her Bible.
    <br>When you go to my kingdom, they will tell you about her.
    <br>I made her to fall.
    <br>Where were you since morning?
    <br>I didn't want her to get free.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The spirit of the serpent manifesting in the life of this woman
    <br>begins to perform a dance practised in her kingdom.
    <br>We dance till morning.
    <br>That is what gives me the strength to fly in the kingdom.
    <br>I fly.
    <br>Everyone born into that kingdom is in my hands.
    <br>I have known you for long but I didn't know anybody would bring me here.
    <br>I have known you for long and the day the God of the universe anointed you.
    <br>The God of universe anointed me?
    <br>The God of the universe!
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are with us.
    <br>She is delivered; you also need to be delivered.
    <br>As the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua declared to the people that the woman is delivered
    <br>and they too need to be delivered,
    <br>the lady falls to her knees set free from the evil spirit.
    <br>I have longed for such a day; you are my father.
    <br>She is crying.
    <br>Why are you crying?
    <br>Help me, Man of God!
    <br>You were displaying; you wanted to beat me here.
    <br>I am sorry!
    <br>POSSESSED By Dancing SERPENT Spirit!
    <br>Let's hear from the sister.
    <br>Praised be the Lord.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Moses Eremi.
    <br>I am from Bayelsa State.
    <br>I want to thank God for the great deliverance that God did for me last Monday.
    <br>I was born in Nembe, Bayelsa State.
    <br>Nembe is a kingdom and located there is Ogidiga - the name of the god of that land.
    <br>Everybody gives respect to the idol of that land.
    <br>Nobody can trespass the laws attached to that deity.
    <br>That is how it has been.
    <br>After some time, I gave my life to Christ when I was about 16 years old.
    <br>Then I began to have some experiences in my dreams - I had sex with people I didn't know.
    <br>Sometimes, I would experience suffocation.
    <br>When I would wake up, I would see someone pressing me and so on.
    <br>I was suffering, crying and trying to find out what the problem was.
    <br>I never knew that there was anything called deliverance.
    <br>I preached the Gospel with zeal.
    <br>People knew me for that.
    <br>Every morning, I would go out for the morning call or evangelism and follow-up.
    <br>That was who I was.
    <br>Then, I discovered in 1996 when I was praying about what I was seeing in my dreams,
    <br>one day, something happened in the house.
    <br>You say you preached the Gospel, you evangelise.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>- You preach to people.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- About Jesus.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>So, how you yourself know that you are delivered?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How do you know you are delivered?"
    <br>Do you listen to that?
    <br>She is an Evangelist, she preaches Gospel, she goes from city to city to preach the Gospel.
    <br>Ask your neighbour again, "How do you know you are delivered?"
    <br>Because you preach the Gospel?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Because you preach the Gospel?"
    <br>Are you sure it is a pure one?
    <br>In 1996 while I was praying, something visited me in the house.
    <br>It was as if the thing fell from my roof and split the ground open.
    <br>The thing came under the bed and then pressed against my mouth.
    <br>I tried to shout, 'Jesus' but I couldn't.
    <br>After that, I started to experience a giant man who would come to me.
    <br>Even when I was in the midst of people, I used to sense when the thing was coming.
    <br>Just like that - after some years...
    <br>- While you were preaching the Gospel?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>That does not stop you from preaching, as long as you don't preach the pure one.
    <br>I suffered under the influence of these demons.
    <br>I would fall and rise.
    <br>In my church, everybody saw me as someone who was not stable.
    <br>It made me cry and that's when I started searching for a solution.
    <br>I used to experience that anytime I went to my village,
    <br>my prayer life would cease and I would struggle.
    <br>In the year 2000, I woke up one morning and started to cry on the 1st January
    <br>and I asked God why I couldn't pray when I wanted to pray.
    <br>That day, after meditation, I slept and saw a huge giant around my area.
    <br>He was very dark and as tall as the Iroko tree.
    <br>His eyes, mouth and palms were red and he was naked.
    <br>When I sighted him, I began to run.
    <br>He turned into the wind, carried me and hit me against the wall and said, "Come and be one of my leaves.
    <br>You are running away. Every Nembe person belongs to this tree.
    <br>I will make you bow before me. You will continue to fall.
    <br>I will make you fall until you come and bow before me."
    <br>I couldn't call the name, Jesus.
    <br>But I said in my mind that even if Jesus did not save me, I would serve Him till I die.
    <br>Then, the wind left me and I woke up.
    <br>After that, I started having strange experiences, whereby I had abominable relationships.
    <br>In 2001, I told my mother about the dream I had.
    <br>I described the place where I saw the thing.
    <br>She said that place was called Sotugum.
    <br>All the experiences and abominable relationships I went into
    <br>were to bring me to bow physically before him.
    <br>When my Christian life became so unstable, I began to worry.
    <br>I started to looking for a solution until 2009 when I saw the man of God on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When one of my relationships was on the verge of breaking,
    <br>I began to look for a solution and I saw the man of God preaching.
    <br>I understood his preaching and became convinced that I could get my deliverance here.
    <br>I came and said that I would spend my holiday here and that God would visit me before I went back.
    <br>So, I have been here for three weeks.
    <br>When the Wise Men came to pray, I said, "God, the anointing in this place cannot escape me.
    <br>I must receive deliverance here.
    <br>Any darkness that is in me, I must not go back with it; I must drop it here. This is the arena of liberty."
    <br>I got angry within myself and I prayed that prayer.
    <br>When the man of God started praying, I started to feel uncomfortable.
    <br>So, I handed my phone to my son.
    <br>The next moment, I was 'off'.
    <br>I thank God today that I am delivered, completely separated from whatever
    <br>or whoever was tormenting me.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We thank God for your life.
    <br>That's wonderful.
