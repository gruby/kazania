    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>There is a man who said he is addicted; you can see him eating the soil, as a demonstration.
    <br>This is sand.
    <br>This is very tasty.
    <br>This is better than normal food.
    <br>This is red soil and it is very delicious.
    <br>For him, this soil is a delicacy; for ten years, he has been eating it.
    <br>This is a different kind of soil.
    <br>Addicted To Eating Soil & Chalk For 10 Years
    <br>This is chalk; this is very tasty to me.

    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>He said for the past 10 years he has been addicted to eating chalk and soil, different types of soil.
    <br>And the way he's eating it right now is the way he has been enjoying it for the past 10 years.
    <br>Man of God, please, help me. Deliver me.
    <br>What efforts has he made to try and stop taking these?
    <br>I tried to stop but the thoughts telling me to eat it are permanently in my head.
    <br>When I try to resist, the urge increases.

    <br>Speak right now! Who are you in this body?
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>How have you destroyed him?
    <br>I am killing him.
    <br>How are you killing him?
    <br>I gave him addiction.
    <br>Which addiction?
    <br>Addiction - he is addicted.
    <br>To what?
    <br>Addicted To Eating Soil & Chalk For 10 Years
    <br>I made him watch pornography.
    <br>I gave him addiction to masturbation.
    <br>Who is the one that made him eat all of this?
    <br>Open your eyes! Who is the one that made him eat all of this?
    <br>Me.
    <br>Why did you make him eat these things?
    <br>He doesn't want to serve me.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am satan!
    <br>How else have you destroyed him?
    <br>His marriage?
    <br>How else have you destroyed him?
    <br>What have you done to his marriage?
    <br>I gave him sicknesses.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>His children cannot get married.
    <br>How did you enter him, you demon?
    <br>Through his relatives.
    <br>Right now, you wicked spirit, get out of him!
    <br>Come out right now!
    <br>Get out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>This demon in him spoke out that it caused him addiction to eating soil.
    <br>Rise up, you are free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Brother, you are delivered for the glory of God.
    <br>You said you were eating these things.
    <br>After your deliverance, we want you to try it again to confirm that Jesus has set you free.

    <br>We can see him trying a taste after his deliverance.
    <br>See him coughing it out, vomiting out the same soil he has been enjoying for the past ten years.
    <br>Just a taste.
    <br>Sir, you said that before, this was delicious.
    <br>But we have seen you vomit it out now. What happened?
    <br>This is just dry soil. It is not good.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I praise You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!

    <br>Sir, for the glory of God, try the chalk as well.
    <br>Ten years of addiction is over in a split second, by the power of God.
    <br>You can see what was once a delicacy to him, very delicious,
    <br>he is now vomiting it out because it's so sour in his mouth.

    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was an addiction to eating soil,
    <br>chalk, and sand for more than ten years.

    <br>It started while I walked by ploughed soil and I perceived the scent.
    <br>A voice said, "Try it; it is healthy".

    <br>Since then, I became addicted to eating soil and sand and the urge increased year by year.

    <br>For me, it was more tasty than regular food and, before I ate a normal meal,
    <br>I needed to eat sand; after the normal meal, I still looked for sand to eat.
    <br>Delivered From Addiction
    <br>To Eating Soil, Sand & Chalk
    <br>Wherever there was a lot of sand and no one present,
    <br>I would lie down on the ground to lick the soil and make certain movements.

    <br>During my search for soil and sand, whenever I could not find any,
    <br>I would make some movements with my tongue because of the strong urge I had for it.

    <br>Once, while I was on my way back from work,
    <br>I saw a heap of sand and the voice told me to try it for it was healthy.
    <br>Delivered From Addiction
    <br>To Eating Soil, Sand & Chalk
    <br>I thought of God's opinion about the fact that I was eating sand.
    <br>Then the evil spirit quoted the Bible that it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man.
    <br>Then, I thought to myself that I could eat sand for it is healthy.

    <br>During the winter, when the soil was frozen - covered with snow and there was no sand,
    <br>I would go to shops where the spirit would tell me to buy chalk and eat it all the time.

    <br>Besides all this, I was also addicted to pornography.
    <br>I would watch pornography on my mobile phone throughout the night,
    <br>then afterwards go to the bathroom to masturbate.
    <br>Afterwards, I would go to bed depressed and get ready the next morning to go to work.

    <br>Can you tell us how this problem affected your life generally?
    <br>I sometimes had weird panic moments that made me worried.
    <br>I was in some kind of cell where I could not speak freely, pray freely, and read the Bible
    <br>for five minutes without falling asleep in the process.
    <br>Delivered From Addiction
    <br>To Eating Soil, Sand & Chalk
    <br>I was trying to resist the urge of eating soil but the more I tried, the stronger the desire would be.
    <br>If I didn't eat it for a week or a month, the urge to eat soil and watch pornography would increase.

    <br>I was at the point of despairing when I came across the YouTube video
    <br>of Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for a woman who confessed to a similar situation I was facing.
    <br>Then, I understood that it was an evil spirit and that I needed deliverance.

    <br>She was describing the same thing that I was experiencing and feeling.

    <br>I understood that I needed deliverance and I started to pray
    <br>for God's mercy to locate me to visit The SCOAN.
    <br>He was merciful to me and I came and now, I'm delivered.

    <br>When the man of God approached me and looked straight into my eyes,
    <br>I felt the spirit rouse with anger within me and was trying to attack the man of God.
    <br>When he said, "In the name of Jesus!", the evil spirit lost its power and I became weak.
    <br>Delivered From Addiction
    <br>To Eating Soil, Sand & Chalk
    <br>Praise the Lord! Now, I'm delivered from that spirit.
    <br>I don't feel any urge and I don't have any evil thoughts concerning eating soil.
    <br>Before, I would stay awake all night, looking at the ceiling but now, thank God, I'm sleeping very well.
    <br>Thoughts of pornography don't come anymore and no more addiction to eating soil.
    <br>Thank God, I'm delivered.

    <br>At that moment, I could not see anyone around me except the hand of the man of God
    <br>who was pointing at the soil and the chalk and asked who gave it to me.
    <br>At that moment, I saw his finger and part of his arm shining brightly.
    <br>Delivered From Addiction
    <br>To Eating Soil, Sand & Chalk
    <br>I'd like to address anyone who has an addiction or the same problems I suffered from.
    <br>No matter what kind of addiction, you should know that behind it, there is an unclean spirit.
    <br>Only Jesus can deliver you. Don't give up.
    <br>Continue to seek the face of God and He will help you as He helped me.
