    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>Some people say, "Why care?"
    <br>They feel like it's a losing battle in these neighborhoods.
    <br>And my response is, "Why not care?
    <br>If we don't do something, nothing will change!"
    <br>It's like T.B. Joshua says, "The reason why we do good is to change the bad that we see".
    <br>So these youth that we're reaching with absentee parents,
    <br>if they weren't being reached, these are the same ones that we'll be doing home invasions.
    <br>These are the same ones that will be school shooters, shooting up our schools.
    <br>These are the same ones that will be committing homicide.
    <br>And what else would you expect?
    <br>Living in hostile, drug infested environments, with no guidance.
    <br>It's a recipe for destruction.
    <br>So without great people like T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners and their support,
    <br>it's no doubt that these youths would be lost.
    <br>Because many of them already feel like, if my parents don't care, then who cares?
    <br>They feel like, if my parents don't want me, then who wants me?
    <br>And since everyone has a part to play, our part is to use every good thing
    <br>to reroute them from the drugs,
    <br>to reroute them from the crime,
    <br>to reroute them from these destructive paths.
    <br>The avenues and the tools that we use to do this is mentoring, being big brothers to them.
    <br>Many of them like sports. So we use basketball.
    <br>When we coach them and train them,
    <br>we teach them integrity, we teach them character,
    <br>we teach them identity, we teach on right choices,
    <br>we also teach them principles from T.B. Joshua's book ''The Mirror' -
    <br>the principles we teach them, showing them who they were,
    <br>who they are and who they shall be.
    <br>And now, they can no longer just apply it on the court,
    <br>but they can apply it off the court, in real life also.
    <br>STRAIGHT OUTTA Emmanuel TV
    <br>I was born and raised in Defiance, Ohio.
    <br>When I was 3, my father died in a semi accident.
    <br>He was hit by a semi truck, coming home from work one night.
    <br>After that, there was a lot of hardship and a lot of struggle.
    <br>There were days we didn't have food; we didn't know if we were going to eat or not.
    <br>In 4th grade, the teachers told my mum that I was too hyper and that I needed to be on medication.
    <br>So then I was put on medication.
    <br>As the years went on, even though I was taking medication, I was still depressed.
    <br>I started drinking.
    <br>I started doing drugs.
    <br>And then fast forward, after college,
    <br>a few months after I graduated, I tried to take my life.
    <br>I took a bottle and a half of pills.
    <br>One night, I was just feeling so low, so broken.
    <br>My girlfriend at the time had just broken up with me.
    <br>I had just lost my job. I was just feeling so low.
    <br>I just felt like there was no reason for me to be alive.
    <br>So I took a bottle and a half of pills and drank a bunch of alcohol.
    <br>Then I drove to my friend's house.
    <br>I don't even remember driving there.
    <br>It was a miracle that I even made it to my friend's house.
    <br>But in the middle of the night, I woke up and remembered that I had taken those pills
    <br>and I tried to stand up, go to the bathroom and try to throw the pills up.
    <br>But my legs were numb from all the effects of the medication.
    <br>I couldn't stand up so I had to crawl to the bathroom.
    <br>When I got to the bathroom, I tried to throw the pills up and that's the last thing I remember.
    <br>I blacked out and went into a seizure.
    <br>The next thing I know is that I woke up in the emergency room, and I literally thought it was a dream.
    <br>After I got out of the hospital, things were still...
    <br>I was still drinking, I was still depressed.
    <br>Then I met an evangelist from The SCOAN
    <br>and she gave me a bottle of the New Morning Water by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When I got home, I began to administer it to myself,
    <br>began to apply it to myself every day,
    <br>believing in God for healing, believing in God for deliverance.
    <br>And I got that healing. A couple of months later, I was able to throw the pills completely out.
    <br>It's been almost six years now that I've taken medication.
    <br>I feel free. I feel good.
    <br>I used to be depressed, I used to be suicidal.
    <br>Now I work full-time for the Emmanuel TV USA team.
    <br>We work with all kinds of kids that grow up in hardship, just like I did.
    <br>We feed the homeless, we help the elderly, we do all kinds of great things.
    <br>I am just so thankful and grateful that God used Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to bring the New Morning Water into my life and healed me and delivered me.
    <br>If God can do it for me, He can do it for you.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>I used to think, it was so hard to reach kids.
    <br>But I found out something - love is the key.
    <br>Just like T.B. Joshua says," Let love lead".
    <br>And that's what we are doing - we are going into these neighborhoods, we feed them,
    <br>we give them Emmanuel TV backpacks and build relationships with them.
    <br>We are even developing Emmanuel TV basketball teams.
    <br>Giving them a way out - away from the drugs and the crime.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Hey, you are good. You need to make an advance, son. You need to be going inside some time.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>Good shot.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>HAMILTON, OHIO
    <br>THE EMMANUEL TV OFFICE USA
    <br>So it's 1:30 am, and we're here, at the Emmanuel TV office in the USA.
    <br>Chris, what's the inventory on the shoes?
    <br>Okay, according to the list, we have 125 pairs for the guys and the girls.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team is arranging, they're preparing to load in
    <br>because we have to drive three and a half to four hours away to the Gibault Children Facility in Indiana.
    <br>And we have so many items that we're taking for them there.
    <br>We're taking shoes, pants and shorts.
    <br>We have shoes for them as well.
    <br>For the young ladies, we have dresses.
    <br>We have a whole load of shirts.
    <br>We have hats.
    <br>We have glasses.
    <br>We have a whole load of hygiene products for them,
    <br>as well as we do at Emmanuel TV resource office.
    <br>The reason why we're doing this is to change their lives.
    <br>Many of them are, as we said before, they're from ages 6,
    <br>some of them are in their teens.
    <br>However, unless something changes,
    <br>they will be there in this facility until they're 21 years of age.
    <br>So remember, many of them don't have any involvement with family
    <br>and so we're doing this so that we might be their family,
    <br>so that we can be an extension of their families and just be there for them.
    <br>We've got to remember like T.B. Joshua says, "In a world that cares less,
    <br>we have to care more and everyone has something to give".
    <br>Everyone can do something.
    <br>Everyone - even if it's a smile, you may just loan someone your strength who's weaker than you.
    <br>All of us has something to give.
    <br>We're looking forward to having a great event
    <br>and we're going to carry you along.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>INDIANAPOLIS, IN
    <br>It's always good to have a team.
    <br>Even if it's a small team.
    <br>Because no one can do it alone!
    <br>Especially when driving is involved, this late at night or early morning.
    <br>Multiple vehicles going from one state to another state, four hours away.
    <br>Having a team is great because one can drive while the other rests
    <br>and you always got to factor in natural challenges.
    <br>And so for us driving from Ohio to Indiana and the Gibault Children Facility,
    <br>our challenge was the weather, because of the season - transitioning from winter to spring.
    <br>So it was a lot of rain.
    <br>However, we stayed the course.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>TERRA HAUTE, IN
    <br>One reason why we're doing this charity event today
    <br>is because of what took place the last time we were at the Gibault Facility.
    <br>If you find something that you do very well, it's an indication of who you are.
    <br>What about you?
    <br>When I was in my other school, I used to go around to other classrooms with my teacher
    <br>and help other kids solve problems.
    <br>Wow, we can already tell you are a leader.
    <br>Right?
    <br>The first thing that you said you love to do is help people with their what?
    <br>Problems.
    <br>Helping them with their problems. Wow, that's amazing.
    <br>So can you tell me, because I can look
    <br>and tell by the things that you're saying what type of person you are.
    <br>So who are you?
    <br>I'm a leader.
    <br>You're leader. Definitely, you're a leader.
    <br>I'm an encourager.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I want to be a therapist.
    <br>There you go.
    <br>And as I spoke with these youths, even though many were medicated and had issues,
    <br>when I spoke with them, I realized this: They had a lot of potential.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>GIBAULT FACILITIES
    <br>INDIANA, USA
    <br>One of the directors was giving us a tour and we came across one of the students in the hallway,
    <br>who was just too hyper to be in class at the moment
    <br>and the director told us that the student is normally very violent.
    <br>But when we approached him,
    <br>he just wanted to talk about music and he was very respectful.
    <br>I think Tupac is still alive, you know that?
    <br>And I can go on for weeks. I've got a lot of research on Tupac.
    <br>You do?
    <br>Yeah.
    <br>Hey Logan, let them do what they need to do.
    <br>They are doing what they got to do.
    <br>- Logan, how old are you?
    <br>- Huh?
    <br>- How old are you?
    <br>- I'm 16.
    <br>- Are you?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- Hi, I'm Diane. How are you?
    <br>Good, good.
    <br>And the interesting thing about it is, he's one of the smartest students in the whole campus.
    <br>He's one of my favourite kids, too.
    <br>He can't just get it together sometimes.
    <br>(Inaudible)
    <br>He's actually one of the smartest students we have.
    <br>All these kids need is family.
    <br>They need somebody that cares to be in their lives.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>First of all, I would like to say that the Gibault Children Facility is doing a great job.
    <br>They're doing a tremendous job, but it doesn't stop there.
    <br>It's going to take other organizations and other people to help raise these youth
    <br>and that's why I'm glad that Emmanuel TV is a part of that in raising these youth.
    <br>Because even though Gibault is doing a great job,
    <br>it's still evident that these youths are hurt and many of them are traumatized in many ways.
    <br>There is a reason why we are here.
    <br>There is a reason why we are breathing.
    <br>- Do you know what it is?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Ok, what about you?
    <br>Supposedly,  God gave us a reason to be here. I don't know why.
    <br>Let me tell you something. Yes, for each and everyone of us.
    <br>I mea,n I went through a lot hurt in my life, so technically I don't think I should be alive.
    <br>Plus, my real mum called me a "Walking A**hole" because I was a walking A**hole.
    <br>Ok, I hear what you're saying, but understand this right here.
    <br>There is something good about you and there is a purpose for everything.
    <br>There is a purpose for an apple, what is that?
    <br>For you to eat an apple.
    <br>Exactly, there's something great about you, there's something on the inside of you that is unique,
    <br>that is different from everybody else.
    <br>Also understand this right here:
    <br>A lot of times, when we are lost in life, it's simply because we don't know the address for our future.
    <br>A lot of times, if we don't understand the greatness that's within us,
    <br>each and every one of us has something to contribute to society.
    <br>Regardless of what you have been through, regardless of what you're going through.
    <br>There's something great about each and every one of you.
    <br>There's something unique about each and every one of you.
    <br>If they're traumatized in many ways, it's going to play out in their lives,
    <br>and that's what's happening and many of them get their identity from the music,
    <br>from media and so forth, especially with not having that family involvement.
    <br>But we've got to be able to continue to reach them on whatever level and communicate with them
    <br>and make them feel important in society.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>So as we were doing this charity event, the local news got wind of it and they came out and covered it.
    <br>And just like many other people when they see the great things going on, "Wow, this is great!
    <br>Who are you?" And like I often tell people, "I am just an extra set of hands and extra set of feet
    <br>that is on the ground to help get the resources to people".
    <br>But it's not really me. I'm not the one that's really doing it.
    <br>It really comes from T.B. Joshua.
    <br>It really comes from the Emanuel TV partners.
    <br>Don't just stand by and watch.
    <br>The generation of today goes by the waste side.
    <br>We can change the bad that we see by doing good.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>They're just amazed by everything that's going on and see we come from a time where
    <br>America used to go all over the world and take resources and relief
    <br>and now America is in need and the roles have change.
    <br>Now, you have great humanitarians like T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV
    <br>come in and send in the resources so that we can get to the need to the people.
    <br>He's someone that believes that distance isn't a barrier, that regardless of where you are,
    <br>we should be able to get the needs to the people.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>So, even though it is different and roles have changed - that's the truth.

    <br>EMMANUEL TV RESOURCE ROOM
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>During our visit at the Gibault Children's Home,
    <br>we came across a classroom with nothing but little children
    <br>and I thought to myself I can't imagine  being six years old with no parents around.
    <br>trying to figure out life on my own.
    <br>That's why it's such a blessing that T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>all across the world, are providing resources so that we can bless these kids.
    <br>Everything that's been done, everything that's been provided
    <br>is making a change and making a difference in these kids' lives.
    <br>- Hi, how are you?
    <br>- I love the Pacers.
    <br>- You love the Pacers?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>- There we go.
    <br>- You're like a little engineer over here, you like making airplanes?
    <br>- High five. 
    <br>- High five, man!
    <br>- Snail, I mean turkey.
    <br>- Snail!
    <br>- Do you want to see how many airplanes I have?
    <br>- Sure.
    <br>- I made them all.
    <br>- Wow, you did?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>- How are you doing? Are you doing good?
    <br>- That's good.
    <br>- Are you reading?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Good. What's your name?
    <br>- My name is Antonio.
    <br>- Antonio?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Nice to meet you, Antonio.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>The director gave us a tour of some of the dorm rooms
    <br>and as you can see, some of the rooms only had one bed.
    <br>Those rooms with one bed are for those students that tend to be violent.
    <br>A lot of them are violent because that's the only way they know how to deal with their problems.
    <br>And those rooms with two beds, well, they are able to get along with their fellow students.
    <br>We also ran into this kid that occupied a room with one bed.
    <br>He was known to be a violent guy.
    <br>But once again, we're talking with him in reference to his dream.
    <br>He relayed to us that his dream is to be a pilot in the Air Force.
    <br>We began going through these classrooms and interacting with the children.
    <br>I noticed that a lot of these young ladies were brilliant in their own right!
    <br>But because of the lack of family involvement, many of them were medicated,
    <br>just to cope with life and that was me.
    <br>I used to be heavily medicated, just to deal with one day to the next.
    <br>But now, it's such a blessing to be able to work with Emmanuel TV
    <br>and just change the lives of these kids.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>- So, what book are you reading?
    <br>- I am reading "Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul''.
    <br>''Class Piggy Bank'' is where I just started.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>Like TB Joshua says, "Your dream is a photograph of your future
    <br>and when your purpose is clear, your life will have meaning".
    <br>So this is the message that we are spreading to all of these youths.
    <br>We have got a Veterinarian here.
    <br>Hi guys!
    <br>As you can see, the Emmanuel TV team has prepared a pizza party at the youths' request.
    <br>Previously, we were preparing a dinner for hundred youth,
    <br>but when we arrived for the charity event, to our surprise, Gibault had gained 45 more youth
    <br>and the majority of youth asked if we could have a pizza party instead.
    <br>So, we ordered pizza, salad and soda from the best pizza restaurant in town.

    <br>It's such a blessing that T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners all across the world
    <br>are providing resources so that we can bless these kids and change their lives
    <br>because some of the looks on these kids' faces when we came in and gave them shoes and everything
    <br>some of them said, "I've never had anyone do anything like this for me before".
    <br>To our surprise, many of the staff at Gibault and even a local police officer
    <br>joined the Emmanuel TV team in giving out shoes.

    <br>Dude, this is sweet!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Transforming America's Youth

    <br>I think it's great. I think there's a need in young people,
    <br>especially those who aren't given their needs as young kids.
    <br>Gibault is a place where they can have those needs fulfilled
    <br>and we have outside people come in, outside influences.
    <br>That only makes people stronger and better.
    <br>That's what these young people need at this age.
    <br>Your very experience - just tell us your position and stuff.
    <br>I'm a police officer. I'm the spokesperson for the police department.
    <br>I travel with groups and speak to groups all the time.
    <br>I see it - there is a need.
    <br>It takes a certain person to fulfill that need because not everybody can do it.
    <br>It is not an easy job to do but it's important so we are thankful for people willing to do it.
    <br>Keith.
    <br>I would first like to thank you for coming all the way from Cincinnati, Ohio.
    <br>I know you guys are all around the world but to take the time to come to Terre Haute, Indiana
    <br>and to work with our children in...
    <br>We don't realize how important it is for kids in a residential treatment facility
    <br>to have someone come to their house.
    <br>This is their house; they don't get to go home. They are here 24/7.
    <br>So for someone to come to their house and bring them gifts like this...
    <br>As a parent, I am always taking things home to my kids.
    <br>You guys are basically an extension of our family and we appreciate it
    <br>because it takes a community to really raise a kid.
    <br>You are a part of our community now, We appreciate all you have done.
    <br>Thank you all.
    <br>Transforming America's Youth
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team USA
    <br>Exactly what they said.
    <br>It's a great thing to see these kids with smiles on their faces
    <br>as they open up something they know they couldn't have where they were coming from.
    <br>They have to stay here 365 days, 7 days a week.
    <br>Where they were coming from, they know they were not privileged enough to have
    <br>Jordans, Uggs, hats, tabogans or anything else like that so you all are...
    <br>We cannot express how much we like you guys and how much we want you guys to be part of our family.
    <br>Thank you for all of your help.
    <br>Emmanuel TV - thank you!
