    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>What a wonderful atmosphere and I know you feel it.
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>With what you have seen todaym I think everyone is covered,
    <br>including me.
    <br>I'm not excluded.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>I am just here to celebrate with you.
    <br>There are some people; when they are saying, "In Jesus' name", they will not answer.
    <br>"In Jesus' name"...
    <br>Just like a woman that brought her daughter here some time ago:
    <br>they were calling the daughter, "Please, go for your deliverance".
    <br>After the service I was moving round;
    <br>the mother said, "Man of God, save my daughter.
    <br>She refused to stand up, to say 'Amen'."
    <br>I said, "How are you, my sister?"
    <br>She said, "Fine".
    <br>OK, she is delivered.
    <br>She is delivered!
    <br>Mere saying "How are you?", she looked at me.
    <br>I said, "How are you? Are we fighting?" - she said "No".
    <br>I said, "How are you?"; she said, "Fine".
    <br>"You are free!"
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Because I was not speaking the language of today, I was speaking the language in the Bible,
    <br>she started vomiting - that is how she was delivered.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So, we are looking for people like that in our midst.
    <br>If there is anyone you know that has been sitting down since morning and asking you,
    <br>"What are they doing here? What is happening here? Why this vomiting?" -
    <br>I'm here for you.
    <br>Or, we have someone in our midst that is thinking, "I don't know whether I'm delivered,
    <br>until I go and see the doctor and do a check-up."
    <br>I think you will know before you leave here.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Those who at the same time pray on their own, "Lord, deliver..." -
    <br>they don't want anybody to know what is happening to them, but on their own...
    <br>I think God can use me to call you out and deliver you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Prayer is often a wonderful revealer of the heart -
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Prayer is often a wonderful revealer of the heart -
    <br>often, not all the time.
    <br>So, we must approach God with a humble, dependent
    <br>and an unpretentious attitude of the heart.
    <br>Not...
    <br>Unpretentious attitude of the heart.
    <br>"Amen..."
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Are you ready to pray with me?
    <br>You must approach God with a humble, dependent
    <br>and an unpretentious attitude of the heart.
    <br>The modest people in our midst are Christians.
    <br>They bow their heads in deference, obedience.
    <br>You see them sitting down in obedience - everything with obedience.
    <br>When it is time to praise God, they raise their hands with all their heart in deference.
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Don't just ask for something -
    <br>"Heal me, Lord," because you are sick.
    <br>"Deliver me, Lord..." - no.
    <br>Ask for something that is right.
    <br>What do you think is right?
    <br>Because you are sick, you want God to heal you.
    <br>So, when it is time for prayer - "God heal me!"
    <br>No one is righteous, not even one.
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Instead of telling Jesus that He must give you this or that, ask Jesus for His mercy.
    <br>Are you ready to follow me?
    <br>Ask Jesus for what?
    <br>The right thing is what?
    <br>Because no one is what?
    <br>The right thing is what?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>When you mean it, you ask Jesus,
    <br>"Son of David, have mercy on me. Let Your mercy speak for me".
    <br>When you mean it, this can save souls -
    <br>life-changing prayer.
    <br>Mean it with all your heart.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me!
    <br>You must mean it, not because I asked you to say it.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You must mean it.
    <br>OK, rise up.

    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me!

    <br>Do you mean it?

    <br>Let His mercy speak for me.
    <br>Prayer!

    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Let His mercy speak for us.
    <br>I cannot hear your "Amen".
    <br>[Amen! ]
    <br>This is the right thing.
    <br>You have submitted yourself - whom you are.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me!
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me!
    <br>If you receive this message, His mercy will locate you.
    <br>[Amen! ]

    <br>Let His favour speak for us!
    <br>Let His mercy speak for us!

    <br>Two weeks ago I was talking about a vision concerning my nation.
    <br>I saw a Seraphim came down with rain.
    <br>That rain brought about calmness and freshness.
    <br>People don't know what I was talking about.
    <br>Very soon you will understand what I am talking about.

    <br>Even though it is very bad and rough now, you will smile.
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>I'm in a nation, continent where they don't understand me.
    <br>If you understand me, I will talk to you one on one,
    <br>but if you don't understand, I have to talk to you in parable.
    <br>I'm in your midst but you don't understand.
    <br>Four years ago I was telling my people that we are in the valley and our future is crying for help.
    <br>They called me all sorts of names, but what is happening today...
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>But then, there was food on the table, everything was on the table, everything was fine,
    <br>everything was OK, but I was telling you, "This is valley. Our future is crying for help."
    <br>And I said politics would not be as usual.
    <br>Can a gentleman join politics again?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>A gentleman.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Pray for your country, pray for your nation.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Lord, redeem my nation, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Ask God to redeem your leaders, nation.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I know every nation has their own stigma.

    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Right now, pray for your righteous journey; ask God to strengthen you.
    <br>The life you received today shall be permanent.
    <br>The new life you received - life of obedience, faithfulness,
    <br>love, goodness, humility - ask God to strengthen you.
    <br>It shall be permanent,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>For those who are coming today for the first time, or those who want to rededicate themselves,
    <br>wherever you are, right now be with me.
    <br>Ask God to make you a channel.
    <br>Lord, make me Your channel.
    <br>I have sinned.
    <br>You are the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Lord, make me Your channel - channel of kindness, love, faithfulness, obedience.
    <br>Lord, make me Your channel,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>You should prepare for your testimony.
    <br>How do we prepare ourselves for the testimony?
    <br>It is an issue of a woman who is looking for fruit of the womb.
    <br>When a prophet says, "Prepare for your testimony" and you are looking for your fruit of the womb,
    <br>the next thing is to go to the market and get a baby dress.
    <br>How To Offer LIFE-CHANGING PRAYER üôè!!! | T.B. Joshua
    <br>If you honour a prophet because he is a prophet,
    <br>it shall be well with you.
    <br>The woman now moved to the market, got every kind of baby dress and carried it home.
    <br>And they were saying, "What are you using baby dress for? You are looking for the fruit of the womb."
    <br>She would say, "I am preparing for the testimony".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Prepare for testimony!"
    <br>Thank you.
