    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am a spirit of an old woman.
    <br>Stand up and sit down!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am the spirit of an old woman.
    <br>The man says that he is the spirit of an old woman.
    <br>You are a spirit of what?
    <br>Old woman.
    <br>What are you up to?
    <br>To destroy.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I'm 90 years old.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How did the spirit enter you?
    <br>It entered me near the river.
    <br>Two men took me near a river to initiate me.
    <br>The man said the spirit inside him entered him near a river.
    <br>I want to destroy him; I have seven powers.
    <br>The first power is to destroy his business.
    <br>He thinks that he can repair laptops very well.
    <br>Watch your screen, that is the man under deliverance, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You can see him manifesting.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Dirty mouth.
    <br>Okay, leave the place.
    <br>Old woman, where are you going?
    <br>Old woman, how are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Where are you?
    <br>You said you are an old woman.
    <br>No, I'm not an old woman.
    <br>You said you are 90 years old.
    <br>No, I am not 90 years old.
    <br>But you said you are an old woman.
    <br>I am not old.
    <br>What brought you out?
    <br>I don't know how I got here.
    <br>You don't know what brought you out?
    <br>You see, the whole thing is mystery, now he is saying he is not the one.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>I am Mohammed.
    <br>See yourself.
    <br>Who is he?
    <br>Mohammed.
    <br>I don't know when I was doing this.
    <br>I know that I was sitting at the back on that side.
    <br>But who is this?
    <br>Is it your mouth?
    <br>I'm the one.
    <br>I don't know how it happened.
    <br>I don't even know how I got here, sir.
    <br>But look at yourself now.
    <br>Think Demons Are Fake? WATCH THIS!!!
    <br>If you hear yourself saying that you are an old woman, what will you do?
    <br>I would feel embarrassed because I am not an old woman.
    <br>It's Mohammed that is standing here, I am not an old woman.
    <br>I couldn't believe that such things like this could happen to me.
    <br>I have been saying that I had not been to any church where I had fallen down.
    <br>I thought that people falling down in the church were just pretending but I felt it today.
    <br>I have been arguing with my friends that all this falling down is just fake.
    <br>I was sitting down at the back; I don't know what came over me.
    <br>I just opened my eyes and I saw myself on the floor in front of the altar.
    <br>Now falling down is real?
    <br>Yes, I believe it now.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Hussein Mohammed from Edo State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I possessed the demon of an old woman.
    <br>For over two years, I had been experiencing this old woman.
    <br>Anytime I slept, an old woman would come and make love with me in the dream.
    <br>Whenever the woman came, the picture in my parlour would fall down
    <br>and when I went to the office, I would find that the same picture had fallen down there as well.
    <br>Anytime this woman came, things would be very difficult for me
    <br>I wouldn't be able to do anything.
    <br>I had been going to many places - churches, night vigils
    <br>whereas others fell down, I would remain standing.
    <br>That was why, when people would say, you may fall in the church, I didn't actually believe it.
    <br>My younger brother had been begging me to come to The SCOAN, saying that I would find a solution.
    <br>I tried to come but each time I tried to get a ticket to come,
    <br>something would happen that would make me leave the ticket.
    <br>Sometimes I would come and given seat number 14, I would say I don't want number 14.
    <br>I would go back home.
    <br>When I made up my mind to come, I sent one of my friends to buy a ticket for me.
    <br>We then came to The SCOAN on Sunday; I was sitting at the back.
    <br>I don't know what really happened.
    <br>I know that we prayed that the Holy Spirit should communicate Himself to our hearts.
    <br>The next thing I knew was that I found myself at the front of the altar.
    <br>This old woman really destroyed many things in my life.
    <br>Things were not working out for me at all.
    <br>Anything I put my hand on, it would not work out.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I'm a spirit of an old woman.
    <br>Stand up and sit down!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I'm a spirit of an old woman.
    <br>The man said that he is the spirit of an old woman.
    <br>You are the spirit of what?
    <br>Old woman.
    <br>What are you up to?
    <br>To destroy.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I'm 90 years old.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How did the spirit enter you?
    <br>It entered me near the river.
    <br>Two men took me near a river to initiate me.

    <br>Ok, leave the place.
    <br>Old woman, where are you going?
    <br>Old woman, how are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Where are you?
    <br>You said you are an old woman.
    <br>No, I am not an old woman.
    <br>You said you are 90 years old.
    <br>No, I am not 90 years old.
    <br>But you said you are an old woman.
    <br>I am not old.
    <br>What brought you out?
    <br>I don't know how I got here.
    <br>You don't know what brought you out?
    <br>You see, the whole thing is mystery, now he is saying he is not the one.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>I am Mohammed.

    <br>But look at you now.

    <br>Now falling down is real?
    <br>Yes, I believe it now.
    <br>After the service that day, I was delivered.
    <br>Since my deliverance, I have never experienced that old woman.
    <br>If you look at me, you will see that I am shining already.
