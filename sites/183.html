    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Charles Muwan Dagara, I'm 34 years old now.
    <br>I come from Zimbabwe but for the last 10 years, I have been living in South Africa.
    <br>I am here today to share my testimony with the people of God
    <br>about how I was delivered from a severe addiction to alcohol.
    <br>But firstly, I would like to share a little bit about my family.
    <br>I was born and raised in a family that worshipped idols and demons.
    <br>I was groomed like that from a very young age.
    <br>At home, they used to brew African beer, almost every day.
    <br>The beer was always available.
    <br>There was a bull we used to worship that belonged to my father.
    <br>According to my mother, I was only breast-fed for a few months after birth,
    <br>then, my grandmother took over.
    <br>She started feeding me with beer from a very young age.
    <br>She would take me around the village to places where she would go to drink and do rituals.
    <br>So right from when you were a baby, you were being fed with beer, rather than being breast-fed,
    <br>your food, as a baby, was beer and alcohol?
    <br>That is correct.
    <br>I stopped being breastfed and then I was fed with beer.
    <br>Tell us, as you were growing up, how did this addiction continue to develop and get worse and worse.
    <br>This went on and on.
    <br>Then when I went to school, just before I would leave in the morning,
    <br>I would be given left-over cider.
    <br>I would mix it with beer and drink it.
    <br>I would sometimes carry beer in a bottle to school.
    <br>It continued even when I started working.
    <br>I would mix beers together and drink anything that came my way which contained alcohol.
    <br>It got to a point that if I didn't get alcohol to drink,
    <br>if I just woke up or while sleeping, I would start sweating.
    <br>I tried water, ice blocks and cool drinks to cool down but it never worked,
    <br>as I would keep on sweating until I got beer.
    <br>When I got beer, I would need to drink about 10 of them
    <br>before I would start feeling normal.
    <br>On average, I would drink about four cases of beer.
    <br>There are 24 beers in each case. So, if we were to multiply, it would be 24 by 4.
    <br>That was on average.
    <br>Our brother is saying that he could take 96 bottles of beer every day.
    <br>It's not only that.
    <br>Sometimes, to be honest, I would drink even more than that.
    <br>Alcohol destroyed the 33 years of my life before I ministered the Anointing Water to myself.
    <br>I suffered two broken homes and now, I am in my third marriage, due to alcohol.
    <br>My wives left me because I had no time for them.
    <br>I spent most of my time drinking, going up and down with friends.
    <br>I would travel as far as 80 kilometres away from home just to drink.
    <br>After drinking, I would drive, very recklessly in excess of 240 kilometres per hour.
    <br>Sometimes, I would not even remember how I got home.
    <br>At one time, I was driving my BMW which I bought specially for going out and drinking.
    <br>I would be cruising around 2am or 3am.
    <br>When the police chased me, I knew they could not catch me with that car.
    <br>Then one day, the engine of the car seized while I was driving.
    <br>When I called the breakdown people to come, nobody believed what had happened.
    <br>The engine just seized as I was driving.
    <br>I was earning a good salary but spent most of it on alcohol.
    <br>Before I bought food for the family, I would first buy beers.
    <br>Alcohol was my everything.
    <br>I wouldn't mind going for two or three days without food.
    <br>As long as I had alcohol, I was fine.
    <br>I was very, very violent.
    <br>If you go where I lived, everybody knew me there for that violence.
    <br>I would beat even a hall of people.
    <br>I would not say this size but big halls in my country.
    <br>If I went to discos and people started a fight with me, they could never win it.
    <br>I would fight even from midnight till morning.
    <br>The police would not stop me.
    <br>I would just fight but when I woke up the following day, I wouldn't even have a scratch.
    <br>But I don't really remember beating those people.
    <br>We can just imagine what that evil spirit has used our brother to do under the influence of alcohol
    <br>but we give glory to God that he is standing here in our midst.
    <br>Just tell us how this miracle happened in your life through the Anointing Water.
    <br>We really thank God that you are here today.
    <br>There was this fateful day, I was busy drinking when a family friend phoned.
    <br>She phoned me and asked me for a lift to church.
    <br>Unknowingly, I agreed.
    <br>I didn't know I had agreed to take her to church.
    <br>So, when I got home in the morning, she asked me to take her down there.
    <br>I didn't want to go but I just said, "Fine, I will drop you there".
    <br>I took them down there and when I got to the church, I dropped them there.
    <br>On my way out, I met this other woman carrying bags.
    <br>I asked her what time that church was going to finish and she told me she didn't know.
    <br>I asked her how she could say she didn't know but she was are going into the church.
    <br>Then this woman said she came from Zimbabwe.
    <br>I asked her what for and she said for her deliverance.
    <br>I couldn't believe it.
    <br>Then I asked which church that was; she said The SCOAN.
    <br>I never believed in this SCOAN thing.
    <br>So, I carried on.
    <br>I left the church and went home.
    <br>So, I came back to pick them up.
    <br>I saw that woman again.
    <br>I asked her if she wanted to come with me to my place and sleep over there
    <br>since she said she was going to sleep at a bus terminal
    <br>because she was going back to Zimbabwe the following day.
    <br>So, I took her to my place.
    <br>When we got to my home, I interrogated that woman.
    <br>Wherever she is, I am very sure she is an Emmanuel TV viewer.
    <br>So, she is watching, right now.
    <br>I interrogated that woman and then she gave me the channel, Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Our brother is explaining how he was introduced by a friend who asked him to take her to The SCOAN.
    <br>He actually was not someone who believed in this ministry or was attending church.
    <br>He even advised the person not to be deceived by such things happening.
    <br>When he went there, he met a lady from Zimbabwe
    <br>who had travelled all the way from Zimbabwe just to attend the church
    <br>and that lady afterwards shared her testimony with him about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That's how he began to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He said initially he had no belief in what was happening here
    <br>but he began to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Tell us, sir, once again, how did you receive this Anointing Water?
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw people being delivered here.
    <br>I even saw people with bigger problems than mine being delivered.
    <br>I asked the people around how I could get hold of the Anointing Water.
    <br>One of the friends brought the Anointing Water for me.
    <br>Then I started anointing myself with it.
    <br>What I did was that one day, there was a service; I took that Anointing Water and sprayed it myself.
    <br>I actually showered my face.
    <br>I made my face wetter than it is now.
    <br>After spraying the Anointing Water, I just felt my body get lighter.
    <br>My body started feeling lighter and I was shaking and something moved out of me.
    <br>I tell you, I have been free from that day.
    <br>It is over a year now and I am free and I never touched alcohol.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is a mighty miracle in the life of our brother.
    <br>So you said, sir, ever since you received that Anointing Water, you have never touched alcohol?
    <br>I never touched alcohol. I can even now smell the bad smell of alcohol.
    <br>I used to think that thing was so sweet but now,
    <br>I don't want to be close to where people are drinking.
    <br>That smell can make me vomit.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, the evidence of Jesus is lives changed.
    <br>Sir, how has your testimony impacted those who knew you as a chronic drunkard,
    <br>as someone who could take up to a 100 bottles of beer in a single day?
    <br>How has your testimony impacted them and changed their lives?
    <br>When I stopped drinking, a lot of my friends came looking for me in the pubs.
    <br>They couldn't find me so some of them decided to come to my place.
    <br>They asked me what happened and I told them I was no longer part of them.
    <br>I told them I no longer took alcohol.
    <br>They could not believe it!
    <br>Those that saw I wasn't drinking anymore,
    <br>I am sure about 10 of them, up till now, they don't drink; they just stopped drinking.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Our brother is explaining that through his testimony, 10 of his close friends who were also drinking heavily
    <br>have also now stopped taking alcohol because of his testimony
    <br>and the transformation they have seen in his life.
    <br>Finally brother, we really thank God for your life;
    <br>what do you want to tell the world about this Anointing Water?
    <br>What is your advice to people who are still addicted to such things as alcohol,
    <br>whose lives are consumed by alcohol -
    <br>what do you want to advise them and tell the world about this Anointing Water?
    <br>Firstly, I actually want to say a little bit about the developments
    <br>that have happened within just a year since I stopped taking alcohol.
    <br>I am now happily married and I have a happy family now.
    <br>I have started business.
    <br>I bought land and started building back home in Zimbabwe.
    <br>Very soon, I am sure I will be doing some very good business.
    <br>I was also promoted at work and a lot of things have happened to me out there.
    <br>I am a living testimony right now.
    <br>I cannot say it all.
    <br>I know very well that there is not enough time.
    <br>If there was time, I was going to take maybe a week or so to share my testimonies.
    <br>My advice to those people out there is no matter what your background is,
    <br>and no matter what you have done, come to Jesus.
    <br>Jesus will accept you as you are as He has accepted me.
    <br>Wow! We really rejoice with our brother; it's a wonderful testimony.
    <br>I believe viewers around the world have been greatly touched by this testimony,
    <br>to see how Jesus Christ lifted our brother from the pit of this terrible, devastating alcohol addiction.
    <br>We can see him here today a living testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>We want to encourage you brother; continue to share your testimony,
    <br>tell the world what God has done for your life and we know the best is yet to come,
    <br>as you do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
