    <br>There's a gentleman. You sleep with animals. You have the urge for animals.
    <br>Okay, come. Urge for animal.
    <br>As if you should get and abuse the animal anytime, anywhere.
    <br>So please come out. Jesus loves you.
    <br>I'm the young man you said that I have the urge for animals.
    <br>I used to see animals in my dream and I slept with them and after that...
    <br>Come here. See your mouth.
    <br>You mean, you sleep with animals?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Any animal that just shouts.
    <br>Your urge is so serious that when you hear (animal sound), you will grab them.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Man of God, deliver me, please!
    <br>How did you come about sleeping with your animals?
    <br>Man of God, I don't know.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Standard for Life
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>My name is Wisdom Linus.
    <br>I come from Calabar, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was having the urge for animals.
    <br>The problem started last year, in August.
    <br>I'm a chef by profession; I cook for people at hotels or at their homes.
    <br>I was employed in Calabar, to cook for a lady.
    <br>In her compound there was a dog and I was the one who fed the dog;
    <br>after cooking, I would give the dog food.
    <br>One terrible night, I had a dream where I saw the dog with my picture.
    <br>Inside the dream, I beat the dog, saying, "What are you doing with my picture?"
    <br>From then, the following morning, I began to have affection for this dog,
    <br>as if it was my girlfriend.
    <br>All my human affection was dead; my feelings were for the dog alone.
    <br>When everybody had gone to bed, at the time I was supposed to release the dog
    <br>to do its duty, I would take the dog to my room when I was about to sleep.
    <br>Then, we would sleep together as boyfriend and girlfriend.
    <br>This had become a habit and because of the problem, I could not concentrate.
    <br>Sometimes, when the urge came after seeing the dog in the dream,
    <br>I would not be able to concentrate in the kitchen and I would make terrible mistakes.
    <br>I would put too much salt or flavouring and before I knew it, they sacked me.
    <br>The affection would happen like this:
    <br>when the dog would come in the dream, the next day,
    <br>everything around me would resemble the dog; I would see the dog every minute and every second -
    <br>both physically and spiritually.
    <br>That was how my focus was on the dog alone, not on human beings.
    <br>The feelings I had for the dog, were the feelings a person is supposed to have for a girlfriend.
    <br>For how long have you been having this problem?
    <br>Close to one year now.
    <br>Sometimes, I would realise that my affection was supposed to be for human beings, not for an animal;
    <br>when it came to my room because he would come to my door, I would chase the dog away.
    <br>After that, he would come and attack me in my dreams.
    <br>The following day, I would succumb to my feelings for the dog again.
    <br>I have prayed and visited several churches where I complained to many pastors;
    <br>they told me to fast and pray but my urge for animals continued.
    <br>Tell us, how did you receive your deliverance?
    <br>How did you get to know about Emmaneul TV?
    <br>The way I received my deliverance began through watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>because I love watching the channel so much
    <br>and seeing the way the man of God is delivering people;
    <br>evil spirits would manifest and speak about who they are.
    <br>I realized that it was my turn to be delivered because my urge was not normal.
    <br>I came last Sunday and to my greatest surprise, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied,
    <br>"There is a young man who has affection for animals".
    <br>I knew I was the one he was talking about, so, I came out.
    <br>The  man of God stretched his hand towards me, and I fell.
    <br>From that moment, I do not have affection for animals any longer.
    <br>That night the man of God prayed for me, the dog attacked me in my dream.
    <br>The dog was carrying my picture, running up and down.
    <br>The next thing I saw was Prophet T.B. Joshua snatch the picture from the dog and that was the end.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I saw fire coming out of my head
    <br>and I began to feel light, instantly.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>My advice to the whole world is this:
    <br>When you experience strange things in your life, don't take them for granted
    <br>and don't run from God; run to God.
    <br>He's the only one who can deliver you.
    <br>The SCOAN is a place to be, I've confirmed it. Praise the Lord!
    <br>We just want to advise, now that God Almighty has delivered you:
    <br>Nothing happens for nothing, and nothing comes by chance.
    <br>What happened to you, you know that definitely, it was caused by sin.
    <br>Now that God Almighty has delivered you, please make sure you give all your life for Christ,
    <br>accept Him with all your heart, make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and we pray that God Almighty in His infinite Mercy will grant you the grace
    <br>to be far from sin, and be close to His Word, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>And we believe that the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Standard for Life
    <br>My name is Wisdom Linus. I come from Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.
    <br>The Lord has done a mighty thing in my life since last week, when I came here.
    <br>God Almighty used Prophet T.B. Joshua to save my life, by delivering me
    <br>from what I have passed through for the past eight years now.
    <br>I thank God; I'm so grateful because I really enjoy my stay at The SCOAN.
    <br>I give God all the glory, in Jesus' name.
    <br>A spirit was tormenting me for the past eight years; it was a spirit that gave me the urge for animals.
    <br>Since last Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied to me and delivered me,
    <br>I don't have such feelings anymore and I know that I am free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I thank God that the Lord Jesus has visited me and my family and we are set free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So what were you actually doing before coming down to the church?
    <br>I have not been working.
    <br>Sometimes, I asked people for help; other times, I washed cars in order to eat.
    <br>I had to struggle before I came here and received my deliverance.
    <br>Okay, so we've heard it from our brother, our brother was set free from an evil spirit
    <br>that pushed him to have an urge for animals.
    <br>Apart from pushing him into such a terrible act, it also destroyed his life,
    <br>especially his career as a chef and also his finances and everything connected to him.
    <br>But we give glory to God that he has been set free.
    <br>Since coming to The SCOAN, we've heard the wonderful testimony of the changes in his life.
    <br>So, brother, we are here today with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, said that he wants to present to you a gift
    <br>on behalf of himself and Emmanuel TV partners worldwide
    <br>to really encourage you now to start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>So we're here to present to you this gift of 200,000 Naira.
    <br>Mr Wisdom Receives Cash Gift Of 200,000 Naira
    <br>From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Wow, we can see the display of emotion from our brother.
    <br>Mr Wisdom Receives Cash Gift Of 200,000 Naira

    <br>Mr Wisdom Receives Cash Gift Of 200,000 Naira

    <br>I thank God so much. I'm so grateful.
    <br>I know that my family has been set free.
    <br>With this gift, I'll come back with a great testimony. in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>I'm so grateful. I wasn't expecting this.

    <br>I'm so grateful. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah. We can all hear it from our brother.

    <br>we're also presenting to him the Word of God, 'The Mirror',
    <br>as a reminder for him to make the Word of God the standard for his life.
    <br>Do you believe, brother, that as you are going out now,
    <br>that you are going to make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and maintain this deliverance you've received?
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I thank God and I'm asking Him to give me the grace to maintain this deliverance
    <br>in order for me to help my siblings.
    <br>I will really work hard, to make sure this blessing will manifest very well
    <br>in my family and my life, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>Amen. We thank God for your life,
    <br>and we pray that God will give you the grace to maintain all these wonderful blessings
