    <br>Rolling slowly down the street in a wheelchair with a large breathing machine pumping oxygen up her nose,
    <br>this woman from Dubai cannot walk due to respiratory failure.
    <br>Just like the woman with the issue of blood in Mark chapter 5 verse 26, renowned physicians have done all they could but all to no avail.
    <br>She has run out of rope and has decided to come to The SCOAN to grab onto faith,
    <br>believing that the resurrection power of Jesus Christ will restore her back into the original position in which He created her.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>I have come from Dubai and I cannot walk because I have respiratory failure.
    <br>I cannot breathe without extra oxygen.
    <br>Please help me, Man of God.
    <br>Say the Word and I shall be healed.
    <br>For the past five years, I have been suffering with this tube.
    <br>I am from Dubai, originally from Sri Lanka.
    <br>I have lived for 25 years in Dubai.
    <br>I have to have a tube and a machine all the time to breathe.
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to pray for her in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>God bless you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>After the prayer, she has been set totally free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, my sister is healed.
    <br>We praise You; all glory to God; thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Praise the Lord! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I could not breathe like this before.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>No more oxygen machine, no more wheelchair, Mrs Pauline can now walk freely, to the glory of God.
    <br>Yes, when Jesus Christ heals, He heals effectually.
    <br>His desire for you is to enjoy the full privilege of being part of God's family.
    <br>Let us hear her testimony.
    <br>My name is Pauline Ramani Gurusinghe; I come from Dubai.
    <br>I am originally from Sri Lanka but I have been in Dubai for the last 25 years.
    <br>That is my sister; her name is Annette Gurusinghe
    <br>She has come all the way from Oman to be with me in this special moment in The SCOAN.
    <br>I work for a big company; I work as a Director of Human Resources.
    <br>I have over 1,500 colleagues; they are all very fond of me.
    <br>I had been wearing an oxygen tube for the last five years.
    <br>They will all know about The SCOAN, T.B. Joshua and all your kindness and graciousness.
    <br>Thank you very much and praise be to the Lord.
    <br>I am a living testimony for Him.
    <br>I used to wear an oxygen tube for the last five years.
    <br>I would eat with the tube, go everywhere with the tube and talk to people with the tube.
    <br>It was full of embarrassment and pain because every time I moved with the machine I felt like a monkey on a wire.
    <br>You can see that now, I have no tube!
    <br>Praise be to the Lord and thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and to all of you.
    <br>Thank you very much and glory be to God.
    <br>The doctor diagnosed that I had hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
    <br>That means the lungs were failing and it could be like 'farmer's lung'.
    <br>That's when you have birds in the house, pets in the house or are working with fertilizer.
    <br>I live in a flat and I don't have any birds or pets.
    <br>My son has eczema so I don't have any carpets; the house is always mopped, tiled and clean.
    <br>I was fighting with the doctor, asking, "How did I get this?"
    <br>He said, "I'm sorry to say, Pauline, you are a test case".
    <br>So, I travelled around the world and I was always a test case.
    <br>They could not diagnose what was wrong with me.
    <br>They always said I had hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
    <br>They gave me all kinds of medication; the most horrible kind was steroids.
    <br>I put on so much weight; I am almost four times bigger than what I was.
    <br>Praise the Lord, I don't think about how I look, but it was so difficult for me.
    <br>Even in my own house, when I was walking, I would look at the mirror and ask, "Who is that?" - "That's me!"
    <br>It took time for me to get used to myself.
    <br>All the time, I would apologise to people, "I am so sorry I have to talk to you with a tube.
    <br>I am so sorry I can't attend the meeting; I would have to bring this machine."
    <br>The machine is like a lawnmower; it makes a lot of noise.
    <br>It's an oxygen machine; without extra oxygen, I could not live.
    <br>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis brings respiratory failure.
    <br>Your respiratory system fails so you cannot walk or talk.
    <br>After a couple of minutes you have to take in oxygen and sit on a wheelchair.
    <br>You can't go long distances or walk like I walked today.
    <br>You have to go on a wheelchair.
    <br>I was on a wheelchair.
    <br>I couldn't walk at all; I needed oxygen and I had to go on a wheelchair.
    <br>The 'solution' is always medication, one medication after the other, but it is no solution.
    <br>One year ago, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Lord told me, "This is the one that can heal you".
    <br>Then I started watching Emmanuel TV and reading about The SCOAN.
    <br>I read about the prayer mountain, the miraculous works, his childhood days and how he built the church.
    <br>I shared that with my whole family.
    <br>A lot of people are positive.
    <br>A lot said, "Nigeria is so far away. Are you sure? We have such a wonderful pastor here."
    <br>But I said, "No, it must be T.B. Joshua".
    <br>My sister here was such a strength, saying, "Yes, I'm coming with you. Let's go."
    <br>I saw so many people being healed.
    <br>At that moment I thought, "Why are you being selfish? At least you can still walk around with your machine.
    <br>Why are you begging here when so many people need to be healed?"
    <br>But T.B. Joshua is such a special person; he is a prophet, a 'God's man', resembling Christ and making people happy.
    <br>He came up to me and asked what was wrong.
    <br>I responded that I couldn't breathe and asked for help.
    <br>He placed his hand on my hand and pressed and prayed and then asked me to get up and sit down.
    <br>Then he said, "Go, you are healed."
    <br>I realised instantly that this was the moment I had been waiting for.
    <br>I removed my oxygen tubes and threw my wheelchair away.
    <br>Up until now, I am not using any oxygen machine; neither am I using the wheelchair.
    <br>I can breathe in and out freely; I walked all the way here.
    <br>There was no chance before of climbing up steps, but look at me. Praise the Lord!
    <br>I could not do that before - I tried to train with a breathing instructor how to breathe but I had to stop after three days
    <br>because it was hurting me and I was swelling inside.
    <br>But now I can breathe!
    <br>Thank you and glory be to God.
    <br>The Lord Jesus Christ is the Doctor of doctors, Healer of healers.
    <br>I will be a living testimony and over 2,000 people will hear about Him from me.
    <br>I always try to tell them that He is a Great Healer.
    <br>Our family is a close-knit and faithful family, and this family will become bigger and bigger in Dubai.
    <br>We will have so many people hearing about Him and about the miracles He has done.
    <br>Glory be to God, I will be His living testimony.
    <br>I will be coming back next year with my family to say thank you.
    <br>I am Annette Gurusinghe; the lady beside me is my sister.
    <br>I work in Oman, although she works in Dubai.
    <br>When she told me she wanted to go to Nigeria, and her faith was that T.B. Joshua would heal her, I said I wanted to accompany her.
    <br>I had seen some videos and Emmanuel TV has done a lot; I watched T.B. Joshua after my sister told me.
    <br>Before that I had no idea about him but now I am very happy and blessed to be here.
    <br>She was having this condition for five years and due to the oxygen machine we couldn't go on holiday or do the things she wanted to do.
    <br>She had to go in a wheelchair but now, praise the Lord, she is healed.
    <br>We are so happy as a family; together we are going to celebrate this.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
