  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I believe you enjoyed today's message.
    <br>It is all about relationships.
    <br>Christians should not pull out of relationships or church under any circumstance,
    <br>such as misunderstanding, disagreement, great conflict or taking offences.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, we should wait patiently for God's release.
    <br>Every Christian should realise that if you are in the place where God wants you,
    <br>the devil will want to offend you to pull out.
    <br>The bottom line is, don't try to make it easy for the devil.
    <br>In times of great conflict in the relationship or in church, stay where you are; don't budge.
    <br>Attending church is a thing of God.
    <br>When we go to church, we are answering God's invitation.
    <br>Do not leave under any circumstance; wait patiently for God's release.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, remember, your heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Tell Jesus you want to hear His voice.
    <br>You want to hear His voice.
    <br>Let your heart come to Jesus first, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>At the command of Jesus, Peter walked on the sea.
    <br>I command every infirmity, every demon that disturbs your life,
    <br>every demon that disturbs your business and career,
    <br>every demon that disturbs you, be cast out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, you demon, be seized, at the command of Jesus!
    <br>Blind Bartimaeus regained his sight.

    <br>At the command of Jesus, I say to you, every situation that challenges you,

    <br>Go, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Darkness is sickness and sickness is darkness, affliction is darkness.
