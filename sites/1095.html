  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>wherever that disease is located in your body, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure; never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>I command that disease to leave you, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>to leave your blood, in the name of Jesus, to leave your kidneys, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>to leave your liver, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>to leave your bones, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever name you call it, never a disease  Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Open your lips and say, "Leave me, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>You disease, I command you to leave me in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You sickness, I command you to leave me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You infirmity, I command you to leave me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>God says it is time for you to leave.
    <br>You disease - it is time for you to leave.
    <br>You affliction - it is time for you to leave.
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>It is time to leave!
    <br>Leave!
    <br>You affliction in the bones, you affliction in the kidneys, you affliction in the liver,
    <br>you affliction in the blood - it is time to leave!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command, "Leave!"
    <br>Open your lips!
    <br>Begin to command, "Leave!"
    <br>I command you to leave!
    <br>Viewers, all over the world, I see them leaving.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I am seeing them leaving you.
    <br>Right now, begin to confess your freedom -
    <br>I am restored. I am reinstated.
    <br>Confess your freedom.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
