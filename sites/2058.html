    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>My name is Floranny.
    <br>I am 27 years old and I am from The Dominican Republic.
    <br>I had an issue on my spine.
    <br>I was not able to move my neck - I had to use a neck collar -
    <br>and I also had fibromyalgia.
    <br>The doctors told me that I had to use it for six months to see whether surgery was necessary.
    <br>It affected me because I was not able to lean back,
    <br>I was not able to turn my neck to the right or to the left or backwards.
    <br>I was not able to do the things that I was usually able to do before.
    <br>When Prophet TB Joshua prayed for me I started to feel how the Holy Spirit touched my soul
    <br>and touched my body, and I fell down.
    <br>After that when I came back up,
    <br>I started to feel that the right side of my body was not in pain anymore
    <br>and I was able to turn my neck to the right and to the left after that.
    <br>I was not able to do this.
    <br>I was not able to move my neck.
    <br>So I am good now.
    <br>I feel fine. The pain is gone!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My advice is that whatever you are going through
    <br>or whatever issue you have -
    <br>it does not matter whether it is a medical pain, a physical pain
    <br>or something that is in your spirit, something that you feel -
    <br>I encourage you to follow Jesus and to look for His Word, search for His Word,
    <br>and trust that He is able to heal anything that you have.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for Your healing.
