    <br>God has no hands but our hands to do His work today.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is moving in the midst of the congregation.
    <br>This is not a natural situation but a supernatural battle is taking place
    <br>that is a battle of the ages.
    <br>But we need not fear as children of God - satan is under our feet.
    <br>When the lightning power of God is present as you can see right now,
    <br>satan has to bow and flee.
    <br>I am the queen.
    <br>I destroyed her marriage.
    <br>What have you done to her marriage?
    <br>Her husband is mine; she married my husband.
    <br>I took over the whole man.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Tayim Anyaelle.
    <br>I am from Cameroon. I'm 26 years of age.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The Synagogue Church of All Nations was the problem of anger -
    <br>severe anger, spirit of masturbation, lust, pornography and lesbianism.
    <br>The anger started from when I lost my  parents.
    <br>I lost my parents at an early age.
    <br>So as a young girl at the age of about 10 years old,
    <br>when I lost my mum, I had an aunt who lived in Ghana.
    <br>She came for me and my elder brother.
    <br>So we went to Ghana to live with her.
    <br>She enrolled me to school (GSS). I wrote the GSS examination that year.
    <br>I was the best student in the whole of Ghana
    <br>My name was even announced on the radio so at that time when you came out the best student,
    <br>they would post you to a special school, and the government would pay or give you scholarship.
    <br>The scholarship would cater for like 80%,
    <br>and your family would just have to pay the remaining few percentage.
    <br>My aunt said that she didn't bring me to Ghana to come and go to school.
    <br>That's how she stopped my education.
    <br>So that anger - that offence - I kept holding on to it.
    <br>Excuse me.
    <br>So that's how I stopped school.
    <br>I became her house help, I was doing all sorts of jobs.
    <br>With no panties on, I would do all the work.
    <br>She didn't care if I ate or wore pants as a young lady.
    <br>This pushed me out and I had to look for friends
    <br>that would help me and this is how I got to know men.
    <br>After a few years - I spent about ten years in Ghana
    <br>and because of this issue I even had a son in Ghana whom I left there.
    <br>So I came back to my country - I found a way to come back to my country.
    <br>I went back to my mum's elder sister - my aunt.
    <br>She sent me back to school (O level); I rewrote my O level examination.
    <br>After ten years of not going to school, I registered for the O level.
    <br>I still passed my exams.
    <br>I registered for eight papers, and I got an A in all the eight papers.
    <br>So by the grace of God after the O level, she looked for a way to put me into veterinary school.
    <br>But that's not what I wanted to do, but since I had no choice -
    <br>you know when you're receiving help from an aunt, you can't command her.
    <br>She tells and directs you.
    <br>So she put me into veterinary school, and that is science.
    <br>I never studied science. I did economics and mathematics.
    <br>So I didn't do well in school, I wanted to leave the school.
    <br>On one of the holidays, I came to Douala where my elder sister lived.
    <br>I spent two weeks holiday with her and by the grace of God, I met my husband.
    <br>When I met my husband, we didn't really know each other
    <br>because I lived in a different town and he was in Douala.
    <br>The school was in Bamenda - in the interior of Bamenda.
    <br>After two weeks, I went back to school.
    <br>After a month he invited me over, and he proposed to me and we got married.
    <br>That's how we just got married.
    <br>I didn't know him as we didn't go through courtship
    <br>so I didn't get to know him and he didn't know me either.
    <br>We didn't know the other's weaknesses.
    <br>It was in the marriage that we got to know each other.
    <br>When I got into his home, he would go to work,
    <br>and I was a housewife, I was at home.
    <br>I'll go through his computer, his laptop.
    <br>I discovered that there were so many pornographic pictures of ladies, naked women on it.
    <br>I became so jealous.
    <br>I wondered, why would my husband be watching other women when I'm here?
    <br>Even when I deleted those phonographic pictures, he would still put them back.
    <br>So that is how the anger started.
    <br>Instead of me to be more prayerful as a wife and not to keep offence
    <br>like the man of God always teaches,
    <br>I fought the battle physically, I would use a knife on him.
    <br>I did so many wrong things to my husband.
    <br>Okay, it is indeed a pathetic situation.
    <br>It's an experience in life and we thank God Almighty that the end result is a big testimony.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Because of the anger, if you look at the body of my husband, you will see marks.
    <br>It pushed me to use knives on him.
    <br>There was one time I gave him a wound here,
    <br>that made him stay in the hospital for almost a month,
    <br>because the knife touched his vein and the bleeding was so much.
    <br>There was one time I chased him with a knife because I wanted to cut off his penis.
    <br>I held his penis and he had to run away from me.
    <br>He jumped from a two-storey building just to run away from me.
    <br>This anger made my husband not to come back home because he was scared of me.
    <br>He would not want to come back home.
    <br>Even till now, we don't sleep together.
    <br>He sleeps in his own room, and I sleep in mine.
    <br>He doesn't want to eat my food anymore.
    <br>So many things have happened, I offended him.
    <br>It made me to put him into so many debts
    <br>because all the houses we stayed in, they already knew us in Douala.
    <br>The fight was too much, every estate that we stayed in knew us.
    <br>I would fight to the extent where - if that anger did not see blood, it would not stop.
    <br>I broke people's properties.
    <br>They couldn't hold me accountable as a housewife so they would always hold him accountable.
    <br>All his salary would go towards paying people's houses, properties and debts.
    <br>I'm so sorry, my husband.
    <br>We know that indeed, you are so sorry because
    <br>that very demon that brought about the spirit of anger is out of your life.
    <br>But before you tell us your testimony and how you were delivered,
    <br>we still want to learn more from your life experience,
    <br>Can you tell us precisely how this spirit of anger actually affected your relationship with your children?
    <br>Yes, I have a three-year-old daughter.
    <br>One day she came to me in the morning because she eats a lot.
    <br>She came to me and was crying, "Mum, please, I'm hungry".
    <br>At that period I was so lonely.
    <br>I would lock myself up in the room and masturbate myself.
    <br>I would not even care if my children had eaten - nothing.
    <br>I would lock myself in. Sometimes I would come out of the room when it is already passed lunch.
    <br>I didn't care if my children had eaten.
    <br>So this small girl - this is her picture here -
    <br>she'll come crying to me, "Mummy, I'm hungry".
    <br>I would tell her, "Oh, go to your uncle" because I live with my junior brother.
    <br>I would say, "Go to your uncle for him to prepare something for you to eat".
    <br>She kept coming come to me.
    <br>That day - I had a huge mirror in my room -
    <br>she used her leg to hit the mirror and it got broken.
    <br>That anger just came upon me, and I beat up that child until I broke her leg.
    <br>How old was she then?
    <br>At that time she was I think two years old - yes, almost two.
    <br>She could not walk.
    <br>I saw that the problem was too much. It was controlling me.
    <br>Even this problem of lesbianism - it pushed me out to meet girls that were lesbians.
    <br>I didn't know but through their conversation they initiated me into lesbianism.
    <br>When one of them mentioned the name initiation, that's when the thought of it came.
    <br>I said to myself, "No, these people are going to initiate me", so I stopped going there.
    <br>But they kept coming to my home and in my dreams too, I would see myself with women.
    <br>So this also made me to lose the affection that I had for my husband.
    <br>When I saw women physically, I would start admiring women.
    <br>I no longer admired my husband.
    <br>So last week when the man of God touched me, that's when I started manifesting.
    <br>This anger started manifesting in me and it spoke all.
    <br>Now I'm delivered. That spirit is gone.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>To God be the glory! Right now the spirit of anger is gone after the deliverance. Is that correct?
    <br>Yes, it's totally gone. Even the urge for masturbation, pornography is totally gone!
    <br>My dreams are free.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>When the story of her pathetic situation was narrated to the man of God,
    <br>he went further to invite the husband and to the glory of God her husband is right here in our midst.
    <br>Mrs Tayim Anyaelle
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me to reconcile my marriage.
    <br>My husband said that this marriage is not from God and he is going to divorce me.
    <br>Please help me, Man of God.
    <br>Restore my marriage and bless it.
    <br>Please, Man of God, beg my husband for me to forgive me.
    <br>I didn't know what I was doing.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Jude Tayim.
    <br>I come from Cameroon.
    <br>I am a Cameroonian by birth and nationality.
    <br>I got married to my wife about five years ago.
    <br>As she said, we met in September and got married in December that year.
    <br>So we never took time to get to know each other.
    <br>It is only when we were inside the marriage that we started to know the other's weaknesses.
    <br>Seriously, what I would like to say is that: If this is how marriage is like,
    <br>then I would advise no one to get married.
    <br>It's with respect to what I'm facing because the heat is extreme.
    <br>I don't think that anyone of you could accept to face that type of heat.
    <br>I will share with you today some bitter experiences that I've been facing.
    <br>I jumped from a storey building because I was running for my life
    <br>as my wife, out of anger, was chasing me with a knife in an attempt to kill me.
    <br>So I jumped from a storey building. I fell down and broke my leg.
    <br>I ran out of the house and stayed out for two weeks.
    <br>I came back later, thinking things had calmed.
    <br>At times, she got very annoyed.
    <br>Whenever I said anything, she would never agree with me.
    <br>She always wanted to command in the house.
    <br>Whenever she saw some funny videos on my phone or my computer,
    <br>it activated her anger, and she started fighting with me.
    <br>Whenever we fought, she always wanted to wound me.
    <br>When she did not find a weapon to wound me, she would use her teeth.
    <br>I have different marks on my arms.
    <br>Things like this.
    <br>Mr Jude Tayim
    <br>Shares Life Experience
    <br>I came back from work one day.
    <br>She started harassing me, asking why I was having pornographic videos on my phone.
    <br>I did not even have the time to explain why the videos were there.
    <br>So we started fighting and she took a knife.
    <br>She wanted to pierce me and I tried to block the knife. Then she cut my hand.
    <br>I went to the hospital and they sew it.
    <br>This other one here was a bottle.
    <br>She broke a bottle - a bottle of beer - and she pierced me with the bottle.
    <br>It affected my vein, and I lost so much blood.
    <br>I went to the hospital and I was admitted there for almost one month.
    <br>My condition was very extreme.
    <br>So this other one...
    <br>These marks are from different incidents. There are many of them.
    <br>This other one was also a bottle.
    <br>She broke a bottle and cut me with it everywhere.
    <br>I decided to separate my room from her because one day, when I was sleeping, I suddenly collapsed.
    <br>When I got up, I realized that whilst I had been sleeping, she had come with a weapon and hit me.
    <br>So I got up. It was her junior brother and my junior brother that came and tried to resuscitate me.
    <br>So I said to myself that I cannot live in this kind of condition because I don't know the future.
    <br>The future may be more dangerous than that.
    <br>So I decided that she should sleep in the matrimonial home,
    <br>and I would look for another room and sleep there.
    <br>Anytime I slept, I would lock the door.
    <br>I locked the door because I was afraid
    <br>that when a person would annoy her, she would pour her anger on me.
    <br>Another experience was that when I came back home one day,
    <br>I found my two-years-old daughter not walking.
    <br>Whenever I came back from work, she would say, "Daddy, Daddy" and would come and hug me.
    <br>But that day she did not come, she was very sad.
    <br>I asked, "What is happening with this baby?"
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know you have a lot to say.
    <br>I want to tell the viewers all over the world that I will not allow this family to go,
    <br>until we have reached an agreement with God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Tayim Anyaelle.
    <br>I'm from Douala, Cameroon.
    <br>The gentleman beside me is my lovely husband.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN with a problem of anger - severe anger.
    <br>This problem really cost me a lot because it affected my marriage and my relationship with my children.
    <br>It especially affected my marriage because the fights were too much with my husband.
    <br>All his body is full of marks because when I was angry, I would use a knife - sharp objects - to wound him.
    <br>I came to the church, and I was opportune to be placed on the prayer line.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, that spirit manifested and I was delivered by the grace of God.
    <br>The following week, after discussing with the man of God, he invited my husband over.
    <br>He also received deliverance.
    <br>I admit that I have been a bad partner,
    <br>and I thank God today that I am saved, delivered and happy.
    <br>The anger is gone. I am free.
    <br>When we met the man of God, he spoke to my husband and pleaded for me.
    <br>He told my husband that for us to enjoy light, we must experience darkness.
    <br>The devil fought us because there is joy ahead.
    <br>Because of that joy, that light that he had seen,
    <br>the devil always fought us because of our future.
    <br>He had seen the bright future, joy ahead. That is why he was fighting this marriage.
    <br>But by the grace of God, this marriage is from God.
    <br>We have reconciled. I love my husband very much.
    <br>I really want to begin by thanking the man of God
    <br>because ever since we've been here, he's been taking good care of us - my husband and I.
    <br>The teachings, the meditations and all the prayers - I really want to thank the man of God.
    <br>He's been taking care of us spiritually, physically, emotionally -
    <br>in every aspect we've been comfortable.
    <br>I've never felt at home in my whole life like I have felt here.
    <br>Indeed the teachings have taught me a lot in life.
    <br>So many things I did not know about Christianity.
    <br>I thought Christianity was just about going to church on Sundays,
    <br>and when you have time you read your Bible.
    <br>But now I know Christianity is when you build a relationship with God.
    <br>You cannot say you love your husband, or you love your children, if you don't love God
    <br>because true love comes from God.
    <br>It's that love that flows from God before you can extend it to your family.
    <br>So I have learnt a lot, and I see myself now as a wife.
    <br>I even pray for my husband - more than I pray for myself.
    <br>I pray for my children.
    <br>I thank God for the faith bracelet. It helps me to build my faith.
    <br>I always find myself praying more.
    <br>This is something that I've never really been doing before.
    <br>This is what I should have been doing - fighting spiritually.
    <br>Like what the man of God has been saying: Our battles are spiritual battles.
    <br>We cannot use the physical to fight the spiritual.
    <br>In terms of your relationship with your husband,
    <br>how have you been relating with him since your deliverance and the reconciliation?
    <br>Oh, it has really been good - peaceful. Now I understand him more.
    <br>Whenever I say something, all of a sudden I get conscious that it is wrong.
    <br>I say, "Oh baby, you know I love you, I am sorry".
    <br>Things have really been more calm.
    <br>The conversation flows. I tell him I love him every day, but before I didn't do that.
    <br>I now ask him in the morning, "Have you eaten?"
    <br>I sometimes even go to get his food - for lunch or breakfast.
    <br>I take care of him. I was never doing that before.
    <br>I did not even care when he came back from work or what time he came home.
    <br>Before, I would just lock myself up in the room.
    <br>My heart is full of joy and peace. I'm so happy being around here -
    <br>it's like Heaven on earth.
    <br>My name is Jude Tayim. I come from Cameroon.
    <br>The beautiful lady beside me is my lovely wife.
    <br>I came here last week on Sunday.
    <br>The man of God also prayed for me.
    <br>He said that many marriages have collapsed because the devil always fights people spiritually.
    <br>He said that the devil saw the greater joy ahead of us.
    <br>That is why the devil was trying to create all this destruction
    <br>so that we would not achieve that joy that God had destined for us.
    <br>That was his word. And he said that this marriage is a marriage from God.
    <br>I have witnessed many changes.
    <br>I did things deliberately just to see her reactions.
    <br>One of the things that I did on the first day:
    <br>I was poorly dressed and she asked me to go and dress up.
    <br>I said to myself, "This is an opportunity for me to see if this girl is really delivered from that spirit of anger".
    <br>So I refused to go and dress up.
    <br>I saw how she reacted: She ignored me.
    <br>I said to myself, "Oh, thank You, God", and I later went and changed.
    <br>Another experience I had was that she has been asking me to buy a Bible.
    <br>That I cannot grow in my spiritual life without having a Bible.
    <br>I know that what she said is a very good and wonderful idea.
    <br>I will not leave Nigeria without having a Bible.
    <br>But I told her that she should not disturb me with this issue of Bible.
    <br>That I will have the Bible at my own time.
    <br>I thought that that would make her mad but fortunately, she was still calm.
    <br>The things that before would have caused anger - you realized that she was just calm.
    <br>She was not reacting to what you were doing?
    <br>All those things that would previously activate her anger are deactivated.
    <br>Now she is controlled by another spirit - that is, the Holy Spirit -
    <br>thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua who came into our lives and intervened.
    <br>This is a wonderful marriage.
    <br>I just believe that we will achieve our goal as the man of God said.
    <br>We will live to see that happiness, and we will come back here for another greater testimony.
    <br>What I can say about myself is that:
    <br>I came here, and I had the spirit of watching too much pornography, that is lust.
    <br>Since the time the man of God laid his hand on me...
    <br>He was talking about how he will just give everybody a friendly tap.
    <br>But he arrived at my side and he gave me a touch:
    <br>My eyes became red as if I had just been smoking weed.
    <br>I tried to look at the man and thought he had hammered my head.
    <br>I said to myself, "That if that was just a simple touch, why am I feeling as if he had a metal in his hand?"
    <br>The next day, I decided to start browsing on my phone.
    <br>I went onto Facebook and the truth is that:
    <br>The things I saw then - a picture that was not good.
    <br>It was not really good for a Christian and automatically when I saw this picture,
    <br>there was an awareness in me and I received a revelation,
    <br>"That what you are about to watch is not in accordance with God's principles.
    <br>Do you accept or do you reject?" I just rejected it.
    <br>This really proved that the spirit that was pushing me into this thing,
    <br>that made me feel that watching this pornography was normal,
    <br>that spirit has left and I have regained consciousness.
    <br>I don't have any urge again.
    <br>I don't have any urge - neither to watch pornography nor lust for women.
    <br>For the few days that I have been here, I've learned so many things that I never knew about.
    <br>I thought Christianity was maybe just about reading the Bible - that was all.
    <br>But I never knew that Christianity is a lifestyle.
    <br>What I can advise the viewers all over the world is that we should always have our Holy Bible with us.
    <br>And as the man of God says, the Holy Bible is not that book that we carry.
    <br>The Holy Bible is that scripture that we read and we make it an integral part of us.
    <br>We read, swallow and digest it into our system - our spiritual system.
    <br>So that at any moment in our life when we are faced with any form of temptation,
    <br>the words can easily flow out from our hearts.
    <br>So we should make God's Word the standard for our life.
    <br>My encouragement to all Emmanuel viewers, both here and outside in the whole world,
    <br>is that indeed, marriage is not a bed of roses.
    <br>Like Prophet T.B. Joshua always says:
    <br>It is two imperfect people who have come together to create a union.
    <br>We need to understand each other more and be more patient.
    <br>And like my husband has said: Make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>I also want to advise women - mothers and married women:
    <br>When you get into marriage, don't think that the devil will just let you enjoy it -
    <br>that every day, there will just be roses and honeymoon.
    <br>Indeed, there will be certain challenges.
    <br>But instead of fighting them physically - like what I did, the mistake I did -
    <br>it is preferable and even the best way to go down on your knees - like the teachings I got here -
    <br>go into your room and fight all your battles on your knees.
    <br>Pray for your husband, pray for your children,
    <br>and avoid friends outside, friends who add nothing to your life but instead divide and subtract.
    <br>We pray that God will give both of you the grace to maintain what you have received here
    <br>by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>We believe as you do say, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
