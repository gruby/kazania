  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In spirit I will say - Happy Easter!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let’s look at the angle of the word ‘fear’.
    <br>This is the manifestation of the spirit today, the end times – the manifestation of the spirit – fear.
    <br>Fear.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I will look at my Bible; let's see the beginning of that trend,
    <br>before Jesus was crucified.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The journey - we have to look at the journey.
    <br>We take our heart to the Book of Luke 22.
    <br>You will take your heart on the journey of Luke 22:39:
    <br>“Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
    <br>On reaching the place, he said to them, ‘Pray that you will not fall into temptation.’
    <br>He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed..."
    <br>Listen to that - that is the proof text now; verse 42.
    <br>"' 'Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done’.”
    <br>I can sense an expression of fear.
    <br>"Not my will, but let Your will be done."
    <br>Take it again.
    <br>"' 'Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done’."
    <br>Verse 43:
    <br>"An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthen him.”
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Let’s take this from this angle of ‘fear’.
    <br>We are living in the end times and a manifestation of the spirit of fear is all over.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>End times - a manifestation of a spirit of what?
    <br>Even before you came here today, you know what had happened to you.
    <br>As you are sitting down, if you hear...
    <br>"What is that?"
    <br>As you are looking at me, you are also looking somewhere else.
    <br>If you suddenly hear "Bah!", you will likely not even say, "How are you T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>before you find your way.
    <br>Manifestation of spirit of fear!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The fear of failure, fear of hardship, poverty, fear of uncertainty, rejection.
    <br>Fear.
    <br>What is fear?
    <br>In verse 39...
    <br>If you are to define that fear, you will define it quite differently from the way you know it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan.
    <br>When you learn someone is sick and later dies,
    <br>it is not that sickness that killed the person - the fear of that sickness.
    <br>It is not the sickness or your challenge that is killing you; it is the fear of that challenge.
    <br>It is not the situation you are in that is killing you gradually; it is the fear of that situation.
    <br>When you think of people who had that situation in the past - what happened to them,
    <br>"They died, oh. It happened to my brother, my boss, the great man - what happened?"
    <br>When people die, they advertise the cause of death.
    <br>You now begin to say, "Cancer - deadly disease" - that is the name.
    <br>Hypertension, heart attack - what happened to those people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear of this, fear of that.
    <br>FEAR CHANGES FOCUS
    <br>The good news is that we have a Friend, the Holy Spirit,
    <br>who can help us to fight this monster called fear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the case of our Lord Jesus Christ in that text.
    <br>He said,
    <br>"I'm not here to do my will but Your will. If You like, You can... but I would want this cup to pass over me."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the case of our Lord Jesus Christ;
    <br>the Holy Spirit is the One who sustained Him, who helped Him.
    <br>Good news!
    <br>The Holy Spirit is the One who sustained Him in the Garden of Gethsemane,
    <br>when He prayed concerning the cup of suffering,
    <br>saying, “Let this cup pass over Me”.
    <br>You can sense an expression of fear: “Let this cup pass over Me.”
    <br>But the Holy Spirit stepped in and reminded Him,
    <br>“You are not here to do Your will but the will of the Father”.
    <br>Let the will of God be done.
    <br>The lesson we are learning now: He said, “Let the will of God be done.
    <br>I am not here to do My will but the will of Heaven. Let the will of the Father be done”.
    <br>What is the will of the Father concerning your situation?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What is the will of the Father concerning your challenges?"
    <br>What is the will of the Father concerning your situation?
    <br>What is the will of the Father concerning what you are going through?
    <br>But you don't mind, you don't want to know!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not here on earth to do your will but the will of the Father.
    <br>What is the will of the Father?
    <br>A man can be sick and yet be a Christian.
    <br>A man can be poor and yet be a Christian.
    <br>Whatever you are going through – that does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>He said, “Let the will of God be done” – that is the voice of Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus dealt with fear at its earliest stage by saying, “Let the will of God be done”.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Jesus dealt with fear at its earliest stage by saying, “Let the will of God be done”.
    <br>He refused to give place to fear.
    <br>He resisted it; He cast it out.
    <br>Fear.
    <br>He dealt with fear at its earliest stage.
    <br>FEAR CHANGES FOCUS
    <br>This shows that having fear is not wrong; it is when we harbour and entertain it
    <br>and let it grow in us that it becomes a problem.
    <br>Having fear is not a problem;
    <br>it is when we harbour and entertain it and let it grow in us that it becomes a problem.
    <br>Fear.
    <br>We must learn to deal with fear in its earliest stage.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Learn to deal with fear in its earliest stage”.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Learn to deal with fear in its earliest stage.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Learn to deal with fear in its earliest stage.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Learn to deal with fear in its earliest stage.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>We must learn to deal with fear in its earliest stage.
    <br>Having fear is not wrong.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you look at the Book of Job 3:25,
    <br>Job said, ‘What I feared has come upon me; what I was afraid of has happened to me’.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is Job 3:25.
    <br>He said, ‘What I feared has come upon me; what I was afraid of has happened to me’.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"What you fear comes upon you; what you are afraid of will happen to you,
    <br>if it is not treated earliest".
    <br>That is what we are going through today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we begin to give place to fear, we are giving place to the devil.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"When we begin to give place to fear, we are giving place to the devil".
    <br>The devil kills, steals and destroys.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"When you begin to give place to fear, you are giving place to the devil."
    <br>The devil kills, steals and destroys.
    <br>When you begin to give place to fear – nursing fear -
    <br>you are indirectly giving place to the devil to strike with affliction, with poverty.
    <br>FEAR CHANGES FOCUS
    <br>The devil kills, steals and destroys.
    <br>When we begin to give place to fear, we are giving place to the devil.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We should not give place to fear because what you fear may come upon you.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>We should not give place to fear because what you fear may come upon you.
    <br>Fear of failure and likely you will fail.
    <br>You know what has happened all over the world today -
    <br>the fear of political, physical, religious, demonic oppression,
    <br>fear of moral oppression.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you look at your right, left, forward, back - fear... - epidemic.
    <br>FEAR CHANGES FOCUS
    <br>We should not give place to fear because what we fear may come upon us.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"You should not give place to fear because what you fear may come upon you."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear is no joke.
    <br>Take note – it is a Biblical fact.
    <br>When you open 2 Timothy 1:7,
    <br>God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power, of love and of a sound mind.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear is no joke.
    <br>"I'm afraid. This is what killed my grandfather."
    <br>Because it killed your grandfather, it does not mean it will kill you.
    <br>This is what satan is using to brainwash us.
    <br>Fear...
    <br>FEAR CHANGES FOCUS
    <br>Fear...
    <br>There is power in fear -
    <br>power to torment.
    <br>There is power in fear – power to snare our souls.
    <br>There is power in fear – power to handcuff us in life.
    <br>Fear handcuffs us in life.
    <br>There is power in fear – power to paralyse our potential.
    <br>Let someone say, "Fear".
    <br>In those verses - Luke 22:39-43,
    <br>Jesus said, ‘If it is Your will’.
    <br>That is an expression of fear but He dealt with fear at its earliest stage.
    <br>Having fear is not wrong;
    <br>it is when we harbour and entertain it and let it grow in our heart that it becomes a problem.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me pray for you.
    <br>You will right now stand up and
    <br>begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear!
    <br>Rise up, right now.
    <br>Plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear!
    <br>Open your lips; prayer!
    <br>Begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear -
    <br>fear of failure, fear of hardship, fear of rejection, fear of career failure, fear of isolation,
    <br>fear of political oppression, fear of religious oppression, fear of moral oppression – fear.
    <br>Begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Every fear – I plead the Blood of Jesus against you!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I plead the Blood of Jesus against you fear – every fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your situation is not the one that is oppressing you; it is the fear of your situation.
    <br>Your situation doesn’t kill but the fear of situation kills.
    <br>Sickness doesn't kill but the fear of sickness.
    <br>Fear rules our lives and disturbs our sleeping hours.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Fear rules our lives and disturbs our sleeping hours."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Fear rules our lives and disturbs our sleeping hours.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Fear rules our lives and disturbs our sleeping hours.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Fear rules our lives and disturbs our sleeping hours.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>When it is time to rest, time to sleep, you begin to think,
    <br>"How will I get out of this problem? Tomorrow - how will I go about it? How will I do it?
    <br>What will I eat tomorrow? How will I pay my house rent? I have a case to answer."
    <br>Fear rules our lives and disturbs our sleeping hours.
    <br>At the time you are supposed to sleep, rest - fear is there.
    <br>Fear becomes a feeling we live with day after day.
    <br>You don't have other feelings again - it becomes a feeling you live with day after day.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Fear becomes a feeling I live with day after day."
    <br>That is fear for you.
    <br>Feeling...
    <br>Fear...
    <br>When fear comes, you lose the sense of reason.
    <br>You cannot reason; you even call your mummy a witch.
    <br>When fear comes, you begin to look for witches and wizards; witch doctors.
    <br>When you get to them, you will be the one, instead of allowing the witchdoctor to tell you your problem,
    <br>"- Have you seen this woman? She is fat.
    <br>- Fat?
    <br>- Yes. It is a woman.
    <br>- My... 
    <br>- Your grandmother!
    <br>- Yes! It is my grandmother."
    <br>You have lost sense of what?
    <br>You cannot reason because of fear!
    <br>When you see on the road a little boy inside a posh car, you say,
    <br>"This is a criminal, thief. See them - they have carried our money."
    <br>Anybody better than you is your enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear makes one to lose the sense of reason.
    <br>You cannot reason again.
    <br>Anybody that is bigger or better than you is a criminal.
    <br>Fear becomes a feeling we live with day after day.
    <br>That is fear for you.
    <br>I plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear – fear of failure, rejection, career failure, uncertainty,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Think over it again, what T.B. Joshua has told you, is still telling you.
    <br>Fear rules your life and disturbs your sleeping hours.
    <br>You have no feeling, but fear...
    <br>You give meaning to every sign, word, idea.
    <br>If your wife does not greet you, and they sack you from your work, you say it was because of your wife.
    <br>If your husband does not see you, and you get insulted somewhere, you say,
    <br>"No, your wife has carried some spirit".
    <br>Fear...
    <br>Bless His Word.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you tell me the message you are taking home,
    <br>concerning this word "fear"?
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>The message I'm taking home today on the issue of fear is that
    <br>fear kills more than the situation.
    <br>With the situation at hand sometimes we focus more on fear than on the situation.
    <br>Fear kills more than the situation at hand.
    <br>Not even more.
    <br>The situation does not kill but fear kills.
    <br>Clap for him, thank you.
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>Having fear is not wrong, but when we harbour that fear, it becomes a problem.
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The lesson I'm taking home today is that as a children of God, we can't have a miracle with fear,
    <br>but miracle always comes only by faith.
    <br>As a believer I must be faithful and not fearful.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The message I take home today is: learn to deal with fear at its earliest stage.
    <br>Don't let the fear to develop into a problem.
    <br>That is simple.
    <br>Having fear is not wrong; it is when we harbour and entertain it and let it grow in our heart
    <br>that it becomes a problem.
    <br>This is the case of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>He dealt with fear at its earliest stage.
    <br>Message that I will take home - I learn that when you accommodate fear,
    <br>you accommodate the devil to destroy you.
    <br>Thank you, clap for him.
    <br>When we begin to fear, we are giving place to the devil.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"When we begin to fear, we are giving place to the devil."
    <br>The devil kills, steals and destroys.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>When we begin to fear, we are giving room,
    <br>we are giving place to the devil.
    <br>The devil comes to kill, to steal and to destroy.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>At the beginning the man of God started by saying that fear is the more deceitful enemy than satan himself.
    <br>The Holy Spirit helps us to fight the monster called fear.
    <br>Jesus refused to give place to fear at its earliest stage.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The message I'm taking home is that when you give fear a place in your heart,
    <br>it is when you allow it to grow in you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>What I learn is that fear is not coming from Jesus.
    <br>Good! Clap for him! It's true!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>You love Jesus so much - you prefer Your Father.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He went for me
    <br>God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power, love and of a sound mind.
    <br>Thank you very much.
