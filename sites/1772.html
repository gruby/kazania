  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, right now, begin to ask God to open the eyes of your faith
    <br>so that you can see those who are with you, supporting you, fighting for you,
    <br>are more than the forces of your adversary.
    <br>I want to share with you some of my habits before prayer
    <br>and I want you to cultivate that habit.
    <br>Before you pray: appreciation.
    <br>Appreciate where you are coming from - yesterday - what the Lord has done in the past, and what He is able to do.
    <br>He is able, more than able!
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot cure.
    <br>Never a disease or affliction He cannot heal.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Appreciate what He has done in the past and what He is able to do right now.
    <br>Appreciate!
    <br>Don't forget you were once a tiny embryo. Today, see what you have become:
    <br>moving freely, laughing freely, looking freely.
    <br>If you don't know, you need to appreciate God, the awesome God!
    <br>You were once unsaved, but today you are saved!
    <br>I was once a rustic boy, but today, see what I have become.
    <br>Appreciation!
    <br>Are you talking of sickness?
    <br>I was once sick, but today I am healthy!
    <br>Many of us were once barren, but today we are fruitful!
    <br>Appreciation before prayer!
    <br>Viewers, whenever you are facing difficult situations,
    <br>such as we are today all over the world,
    <br>in which it seems there is no future, no way forward, just as we are today,
    <br>you should learn to use the weapon of your testimony and confession.
    <br>"I was sick; I am healed."
    <br>"I was a rustic guy; today see what I am."
    <br>"I was unsaved, but today I'm saved."
    <br>Your weapon of testimony and confession of what He has done in the past
    <br>and what He is able to do right now, in the face of your circumstances.
    <br>My habit imparts a strength to endure my present challenges, my present circumstances.
    <br>So, this will impart to you - to endure your present difficulty.
    <br>This will give you strength to face the situation at hand.
    <br>Viewers, right now begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear:
    <br>fear of cancer, fear of virus, fear of disease, fear of affliction, fear of disappointment,
    <br>fear, fear, fear of this, fear of that.
    <br>Begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear.
    <br>Resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>I want you to know I am not alone here.
    <br>You need to see those who are supporting me,
    <br>those who are supporting my position,
    <br>and those who are fighting for me - those who are with us here.
    <br>I command you to begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen:
    <br>I'm not alone here! Listen to me.
    <br>Begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All circumstances can lead us to You, Lord.
    <br>Your children need Your Healing Hand.
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a sickness You cannot heal.
    <br>Never a problem You cannot solve.
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The right hand of God is power!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Bless them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Those on the sickbed - Lord Jesus, guide the medical practitioners,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Guide the medical practitioners, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Guide the medical practitioners who will work on them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Use them to restore their health, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Lord Jesus, guide the surgeon's hands!
    <br>May their bodies respond quickly to treatment, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>May their bodies respond to treatment, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Guide the surgeon's hands.
    <br>May their bodies respond quickly to treatment, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, this prayer is not time-bound.
    <br>I mean, it is not bound by time.
    <br>Anytime you hear it, the presence of God is maintained.
    <br>I want to leave you in faith.
    <br>I'm expecting to meet you in faith, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
