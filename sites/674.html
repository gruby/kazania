  <p>    
    <br>Man of God, please I had an ankle injury before the games.
    <br>I am the volunteer manager for the FIFA U17 World Cup.
    <br>Man of God, they didn't arrange me for the prayer line because they say that my case is very bad.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>I know that God can use you.
    <br>I have a malunited tibia.
    <br>They have booked me for total knee replacement in India.
    <br>Man of God, I am too young to have a total knee replacement.
    <br>That surgery may not be successful and I will never walk.
    <br>Man of God, please help me, please help me.
    <br>Why did you not go to the prayer line?
    <br>Sir, they felt that my case was too bad.
    <br>I told them that I am going to have a total knee replacement, sir.
    <br>- They said that your case was too bad?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>But with God all things are possible.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>What makes your case worse?
    <br>Man of God, I have been referred to Artemis Health Institute, India for a total knee replacement.
    <br>Even India say that I am too young for it.
    <br>I am just 43 years old, that operation cannot be done for my age.
    <br>Man of God, please, I know that God is going to use you to heal her.
    <br>Man of God, please help my mother. Please, sir.
    <br>Sir, she cannot walk on her own. I have to follow her around.
    <br>Okay, let us go and pray for her.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>Do we have anyone here that believes that God cannot use him to perform miracles at all?
    <br>You believe that God cannot use you, you find it difficult to believe that miracles are possible - stand up.
    <br>My name is Obachide Ani.
    <br>I am a citizen of Nigeria but I reside in South Africa.
    <br>I find it hard to believe that there are miracles.
    <br>Come.
    <br>You listened to the sister.
    <br>What did the sister say?
    <br>She said that God can use you to deliver her, to heal her.
    <br>What do you understand her problem is?
    <br>It is worse, man of God.
    <br>- The situation is worse.
    <br>- It is worse.
    <br>Go and meet her and ask her and find out the situation she is in.
    <br>So that I can now reveal God to you,
    <br>go and meet her.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>He is very good - I love him.
    <br>There are millions people at home that will be changed, so take note.
    <br>The woman should explain how she came here, who she is, where she is from, what is her situation.
    <br>Please, let us hear the discussion.
    <br>Ask questions, any question, so that you will know the impossibility you are facing -
    <br>it is only God that can make it possible.
    <br>Please sister, what is your name?
    <br>I am Mrs Okorie.
    <br>What is the problem that brought you to The SCOAN?
    <br>I am the volunteer manager for the FIFA U17 World Cup that just concluded but I have not concluded my own job.
    <br>Before the games, I slipped and fractured the distal of my ankle, both the tibia and the fibular.
    <br>Prior to this, two years ago, January 13th precisely, I had a car crash and I had a fracture of the tibia
    <br>and this very fracture before the games has caused a malunited fracture of my tibia
    <br>and I have been referred to Artemis Health Institute, India
    <br>for a total knee replacement.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN is that of the total knee replacement
    <br>because I am 43 years and I am too young for this surgery.
    <br>Do you believe that God can heal you?
    <br>If I didn't believe, I wouldn't have come from Abuja to this place.
    <br>I believe strongly that God is going to use the man of God to heal me, totally.
    <br>Brother, come.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>Watch the screen.
    <br>There is a brother who is here for the first time today and he came all the way from South Africa.
    <br>To maintain the grace, that is where the problem lies.
    <br>Anybody can be used to raise the dead but to maintain that grace of continuing doing it, is where the problem lies.
    <br>You, go there now and touch the woman.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>Watch the screen - instruction in righteousness...
    <br>Your two hands, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>You will first of all ask for forgiveness and say, "Lord, Your mercy and Your favor is all I need."
    <br>Repeat after me: Thank You Lord.
    <br>Your mercy and Your favor is all I need.
    <br>Forgive me my sins, Lord.
    <br>Son of David,
    <br>have mercy on me
    <br>and commit Yourself to the healing of this sister,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>You can bend now and touch the leg.
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Touch the first leg. The knees.
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you just hold the woman - her right hand?
    <br>Place your hand of her head.
    <br>Now, it is between you and God Almighty.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Watch your screen, as Mrs Okorie, who is a volunteer manager for the just concluded FIFA U16 World Cup...
    <br>I am watching in the same way you are watching.
    <br>She said she had a car crash many years ago and since then she has been unable to walk...
    <br>Okay, you can remove your hand.
    <br>Woman, it is not this man that is working. It is God, rise up.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>Watch your screen - see the woman walking.
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest.
    <br>Awesome God
    <br>Mighty God
    <br>We give You praise
    <br>Awesome God
    <br>We give You praise
    <br>Mighty God
    <br>You are highly lifted up
    <br>Awesome God
    <br>You are highly lifted up
    <br>Mighty God
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>- Welcome to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>I am Mrs Esther Okorie.
    <br>I am a senior civil servant; a volunteer administrator with the just concluded FIFA U17 World Cup
    <br>and at the same time, a minister of the gospel.
    <br>The problems all started in 2008.
    <br>I was involved in a very serious motorcar accident that killed the driver instantly.
    <br>I had a fracture of the tibial plateau.
    <br>This was managed at the orthopedic hospital, but there was a mistake.
    <br>At the end of the day, the tibial was malunited (not united well).
    <br>I kept managing it, until I went for the Under 17 World Cup as the volunteer manager.
    <br>One day I was going to the toilet to ease myself and I slipped and fractured my ankle.
    <br>So the two became a very serious problem.
    <br>Since then, for two years now, I have been confined to crutches.
    <br>You were confined to the use of the pair of the crutches we are seeing with your daughter?
    <br>Yes, I was.
    <br>How did you feel each time you had to use those crutches?
    <br>I felt very bad.
    <br>I didn't feel okay at all because it restricted my movement, it affected everything.
    <br>It affected everything in my life, even my marriage.
    <br>I was asked to go to India because of the malunited tibia.
    <br>They said that it affected the knee and they were questioning whether they had to do a total knee replacement.
    <br>At the age of 43, this is not proper.
    <br>They have just invited me to see what they can do. There is no permanent solution.
    <br>They want to see how they can manage it.
    <br>As for the fracture of the tibia, they can manage it in Nigeria but that of the knee is the problem.
    <br>When I came here, I came to be arranged at the prayer line like others were,
    <br>but along the way I was told that my case could not be arranged at the prayer line.
    <br>Of course, the reason I came here was to be healed, because I have seen the healing testimonies on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>While the second service was going on, and after the prayer line, when the man of God started praying,
    <br>I raised my voice and told him who I was.
    <br>I cried out and told him my problem.
    <br>I told him what happened to me at the prayer line.
    <br>The man of God asked during the service if there was anyone who did not believe in miracles.
    <br>The brother, who finally was used by God, said he didn't believe
    <br>and the man of God asked him to come out and that God was going to use him.
    <br>The brother came out.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua did not even touch him; he just sent him to where I was.
    <br>He (T.B. Joshua) told him to repeat after him, then he laid his hands on my legs and asked me to stand up.
    <br>I stood up, I walked. Even after the service I walked a good distance in this church.
    <br>I have not felt the pain.
    <br>By the grace of God I am healed.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Who are the two sisters standing behind you?
    <br>They are my daughters.
    <br>Let's hear from them.
    <br>My name is Chidinma.
    <br>With my mother's condition, I am very happy because I have been waiting for this day to come.
    <br>I am happy that at last she has dropped her crutches.
    <br>She can go anywhere on her own now without any aid.
    <br>So I am very happy.
    <br>Before now, the real situation was that she could not move on her own.
    <br>Even at home, someone had to be by her side.
    <br>Before she could do anything, someone must be by her side to assist her.
    <br>When she is left (on her own) she cannot do anything.
    <br>But today, she can do everything on her own without the crutches.
    <br>Praise God.
    <br>My name is Chinazom.
    <br>My mum had this accident in 2008.
    <br>That was the year I got admission into university, so it was really difficult.
    <br>The January that I was starting school was when she had the accident and then, she was confined in the hospital for months.
    <br>Without her it has not been easy at all.
    <br>Today, I give God all the praise.
    <br>We saw you shedding tears the moment the miracle happened.
    <br>Can you tell us what prompted you to do that?
    <br>It was like, is this happening or is it not happening?
    <br>I don't even know what to say.
    <br>Tears just came because I didn't believe it was going to happen just like that.
    <br>She has been in hospital for months and it didn't happen. Now, in just seconds, it happened.
    <br>I didn't know why I had started crying.
    <br>Can you tell us your name and where you come from?
    <br>My name is Obachide Ani
    <br>I came from South Africa but I am a Nigerian.
    <br>Before, I used to be one of the doubting Thomas' who never believed in miracles.
    <br>By His grace, God used me through the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>to perform the miracle which I had doubted.
    <br>I thank God that it happened through me.
    <br>Within me I was still doubting whether I could do it.
    <br>But something inside of me said that I could do it as the man of God had instructed me.
    <br>He (T.B. Joshua) said I must say what he said, I must follow his words, which I did.
    <br>Immediately, the woman got up.
    <br>Now I don't doubt anymore.
    <br>I believe that God can heal and He still heals.
    <br>My advice to the viewers:
    <br>I used to be one of the doubters, but today God has turned around my story.
    <br>Now they can see that it happens.
    <br>God is still the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>We just want to hear from the woman again.
    <br>I have no business with the crutches.
    <br>Watch An ATHEIST Perform A MIRACLE!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Now, can you tell us your message of hope to all who are watching you out there?
    <br>Whatever be the works of the devil in your life, Jesus has come to destroy it.
    <br>He is raising men and women all over the world of which Prophet T.B. Joshua is one.
    <br>The wonderful thing about this testimony is that he himself (Prophet T.B. Joshua) was not a part of it.
    <br>He sent somebody.
    <br>For those who are maybe saying that Prophet T.B. Joshua is this or that,
    <br>by the grace of God, he used someone different. He didn't even touch the person and God still did it.
    <br>Jesus is the Healer!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
