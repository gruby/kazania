    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Listen, every influence...
    <br>You are being influenced to do what you don't want to do.
    <br>You are being influenced to say what you don't want to say.
    <br>You are being influenced to look at what you don't want to look at.
    <br>You are being influenced to think what you don't want to think.
    <br>Every influence, I command you right now - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I'm the idol, spiritual husband.
    <br>Yes, from the mother's side, from the father's side.
    <br>I have frustrated her.
    <br>I have made her go to four men, with 8 children, and all of them run away.
    <br>She has no home, I have frustrated her; as she can see herself now...
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let me speak to your heart;
    <br>I want to speak to your heart.
    <br>Any temple in your heart, spirit, every will that is not God's will within your spirit, heart -
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, I command them out! I say, out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>She's mine. I am the spiritual husband, the man in charge.
    <br>How many of you are inside of her?
    <br>It's only me. I'm in charge of this body.
    <br>She's mine.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>I say, be delivered!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Angela Uchechi.
    <br>I am 38 years old.
    <br>I am from Ebonyi State, Nigeria
    <br>The problems that have brought me here were a spiritual husband,
    <br>evil attacks and severe headaches.
    <br>It has affected me in so many ways.
    <br>I was always angry and I was never happy
    <br>but I pretended to people around me that I was happy.
    <br>I used to eat and make love in the dream.
    <br>I was barren for 11 years until I prayed with the man of God on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>After the prayer, I met with my husband, and I conceived and had my baby.
    <br>Congratulations, ma. During the course of today's Mass Prayer Service,
    <br>we saw you manifest. What really happened to you, madam?
    <br>When the man of God was praying, I didn't know what came over me.
    <br>All of a sudden, I felt a cold sensation, and I found myself on the floor.
    <br>I was delivered.
    <br>Hallelujah. So do you believe that this deliverance you received
    <br>has brought breakthrough and salvation to your life?
    <br>Yes, I believe, in Jesus' name.  
    <br>For me and my family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We want to encourage you that to make this deliverance permanent,
    <br>make God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>stay true to God Almighty all the rest of your life, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am delivered.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
