  <p>    
    <br>Jesus is on the throne.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Jesus is on the throne".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I want to salute our viewers.
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to view us, thank you for your time.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>For some weeks now, we have been talking about challenges - what does this mean to you,
    <br>and what does this mean to me, as a Christian?
    <br>Because of the situation we are in...
    <br>We seem to be in perilous times – a time that looks so strange.
    <br>You have no word to define it.
    <br>What is happening in your country is what is happening in another country.
    <br>Everywhere:
    <br>economic oppression,
    <br>political oppression,
    <br>religious oppression,
    <br>institutionalised corruption everywhere.
    <br>What are you waiting for?
    <br>Will you be ready when the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready 
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Will you be ready?
    <br>Yes – the signs we are seeing show that you should be ready.
    <br>Don’t allow the challenges or situation you are facing to cause you
    <br>to overthrow your position before God.
    <br>What are the challenges?
    <br>You know the challenges you are going through.
    <br>The challenge, as a Christian, is meant to strengthen our desire and determination for God.
    <br>The more that challenge, the more you see God clearer,
    <br>the more you pray and fast, the more your desire.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Today, we take our reading from the Book of Matthew 16 - that will be our proof reading.
    <br>Another reading: you take the Book of 1 Peter, chapter 5 - start your reading from verse 8,
    <br>8, 9, 10 - that will really help you to understand, to have an insight of what we are about to talk about.
    <br>2 Timothy would also be a better reading for you -
    <br>2 Timothy, chapter 3 - you take your reading from verse 10 to the end.
    <br>The Book of Hebrews 3 - take your reading from verse 6.
    <br>I want to believe you are there.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>I hope your mind is not divided because I need your heart.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Not just your appearance but your heart.
    <br>If your heart is not here, who am I talking to?
    <br>I am talking in vain.
    <br>Your heart is the strong room, the prayer room, the contact point.
    <br>When I say, ‘your heart,’ I mean, ‘your spirit’.
    <br>Your sprit is what the Holy Spirit will use to express Himself – through your heart.
    <br>Are your here?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If you are here; look at me - what are you seeing?
    <br>You are seeing a jacket - you are not here.
    <br>If you are here, you will not see this jacket, you will not even see this appearance.
    <br>You will not see a man looking like your brother.
    <br>Beyond that man is the Man you are here for.
    <br>Also, in the Book of John 15 - it will help you, and Romans 1, verse 14 - that will really help you.
    <br>Let's start our reading - Matthew 16.
    <br>“The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him
    <br>by asking him to show them a sign from Heaven.”
    <br>That is the question I'm asking you now, "Are you here?"
    <br>This is a piece of Heaven on earth – it is an extension.
    <br>What we are about to do is an extension.
    <br>Let's go to the proof text in verse 24.
    <br>“Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves...'"
    <br>Whoever wants to follow me must do what?
    <br>[Deny yourself.]
    <br>That is for you; you insert your name where the message is personal.
    <br>Here, it seems to be too personal.
    <br>If I want to be His disciple, follower, I must do what?
    <br>[Deny myself.]
    <br>How do we deny ourselves?
    <br>By putting on suit, wig, powder, jeep...
    <br>OK, that is it.
    <br>"'... and take up their cross and follow me'."
    <br>Are you taking your cross?
    <br>Deny yourself and take up your cross and follow Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>And it says further:
    <br>“For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.”
    <br>When you take your time to read, you will see that salvation is more than just saying,
    <br>“Lord Jesus, I am a sinner”.
    <br>Altar call everywhere.
    <br>Many of you have given your life to Jesus.
    <br>You give your life to yourself.
    <br>Salvation is more than just saying,
    <br>"Hey, altar call!" - you rush out, you come out.
    <br>“Lord Jesus, I am a sinner; come into my heart. Wash me with Your precious blood."
    <br>He is lying.
    <br>“Save my soul today” – then going on your merry way.
    <br>Salvation is more than that.
    <br>Salvation is a total and complete commitment to Jesus.
    <br>OUR COMMITMENT TO JESUS
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He went for me
    <br>If you love someone, love is a thing of heart; love is not a thing of mouth.
    <br>That is why marriage is crumbling today;
    <br>because we see that he loves someone because she is beautiful, because of accent,
    <br>"My husband can speak very well. I love him. I want to marry him".
    <br>You love someone because of their attire, appearance - no!
    <br>Love is a thing of heart.
    <br>When heart is involved – total and complete commitment.
    <br>"How I love Jesus!"
    <br>You cannot get Jesus to forgive your sins without making a commitment to Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>“I cannot get Jesus to forgive my sins without total commitment,
    <br>without making a commitment to Him.”
    <br>Salvation is not just merely saying, “Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood. Save my soul today”.
    <br>That is why people are not saved today.
    <br>You see questionable born-again, believers, Christians.
    <br>Knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him.
    <br>"Jesus is my Lord, Saviour, Healer, I'm born-again..."
    <br>Knowing facts about Him does not change our relationship with Him.
    <br>This is what the Book of Matthew 16:24 and Matthew 10:38 is saying.
    <br>Jesus said if you do not take up your cross and deny yourself
    <br>and perhaps even get killed for your belief in Him, you are not worthy of Him.
    <br>Worthy You are worthy
    <br>King of kings Lord of lords
    <br>You are worthy
    <br>Worthy You are worthy
    <br>King of kings Lord of lords
    <br>I worship You
    <br>If you do not take up your cross and deny yourself
    <br>and perhaps even get killed for your belief in Him, you are not worthy of Him.
    <br>Who is Jesus?
    <br>His worshippers must worship Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>Get to Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>Talk to Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>Worship Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>Admire Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>Pray to Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>Jesus is not going to give salvation to those who do not endure to the end.
    <br>He will come like a thief in the night.
    <br>No one knows when or how.
    <br>The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>He is not going to give salvation to those who will not endure to the end.
    <br>What manner of man is Jesus?
    <br>OUR COMMITMENT TO JESUS
    <br>Total and complete commitment to Jesus.
    <br>We literally sell ourselves to Him.
    <br>We are then debtors.
    <br>We no longer belong to ourselves; we are servants.
    <br>I want to move my leg; I need to consult Him, because I no longer belong to myself,
    <br>"Jesus!".
    <br>I want to wear suit, "Jesus!"
    <br>You don’t know how much you need Him; that is why your life is like this.
    <br>You only need Him when you have problems, when you are sick.
    <br>When you have challenges, when you have difficulties, you need Jesus.
    <br>You don’t know how much you need Him.
    <br>What kind of life is that?
    <br>It means you are not a servant.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"You don't know how much you need Jesus."
    <br>You only need Him when you have challenges; you need Him when you have difficulties.
    <br>That is when you need Jesus.
    <br>You must know how much you need Him.
    <br>Because we no longer belong to ourselves; we are then debtors.
    <br>The word ‘commitment’ is neither taught nor practised today.
    <br>In Romans 1:14, Paul said, “I am a debtor”.
    <br>Christ bought Paul even as He bought us.
    <br>This means salvation is a sale; it is a transaction.
    <br>Christ bought and paid for us.
    <br>What a terrible price Christ had to pay for us!
    <br>He paid a debt He did not owe
    <br>I owed a debt I could not pay
    <br>I needed Someone to wash my sins away
    <br>Now I can sing a brand new song
    <br>Amazing grace
    <br>Lord Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay
    <br>He paid a debt He did not owe
    <br>I owed a debt I could not pay
    <br>I needed Someone to wash my sins away
    <br>Now I can sing a brand new song
    <br>Amazing grace
    <br>Lord Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I don’t think enough people understand this:
    <br>The level at which satan attacks us seems to be equal to the level of our commitment to Him.
    <br>This is why I said I don’t think enough people understand this.
    <br>The level at which satan attacks us seems to be equal to the level of our commitment to God.
    <br>- "Oh, what is this man saying?"
    <br>- "Yes!"
    <br>Job was totally committed to God Almighty.
    <br>That is the reason God was willing to take up satan’s challenge against him.
    <br>If you are totally committed to God Almighty, He will take up satan’s challenge against you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you are totally committed to God, God will take up satan’s challenge against you.
    <br>"I have this, that" - no!
    <br>The life you live is no longer yours.
    <br>We no longer belong to ourselves; whatever you are facing is Christ’s.
    <br>You face challenges – Christ’s.
    <br>You face sickness – Christ’s.
    <br>You face this - Christ's.
    <br>You feel it so much because you are not living for Christ; you are not committed to Christ.
    <br>In John 15, as soon as you become born again, as soon as you make a conversion,
    <br>then, satan hates you the same as he hates Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>“As soon as you make a conversion, I mean, as soon as you become born again,
    <br>as soon as you are saved, then, satan hates you the same as he hates Jesus.”
    <br>The moment you are saved, you are engaged in a phenomenal battle.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The moment you are saved, the moment you are born again,
    <br>the moment you have become a believer, truly, the moment you are truly born again,
    <br>you are engaged in a phenomenal battle.
    <br>Not just battle - no!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not a battle of flesh and blood – like the kind of enemy you have today.
    <br>You say your brother hates you and your brother has flesh and blood.
    <br>I don’t know the kind of enemy you have.
    <br>You say, "That my brother hates me" - no!
    <br>Our hate is towards spirit being, not towards your brother.
    <br>Your enemy is not your brother; your enemy is not your husband.
    <br>Your enemy is not your wife; your enemy is not the chairman of your company.
    <br>Your enemy is not your mentor but spirit beings that cause tension and pressure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why you always fail the battle.
    <br>You fail the battle all the time because you see your brother as your enemy.
    <br>You always fail the battle.
    <br>If you want to become victorious in whatever you lay your hand, in whatever you attempt,
    <br>see spirit beings as your enemy that cause tension and pressure; you will overcome.
    <br>Many of you were saying, "T.B. Joshua is this, that".
    <br>You really persecuted me in those days.
    <br>I don't see you as a persecutor.
    <br>I see that being pushing you to do that.
    <br>If somebody comes to me and says, "Hey!", I look at you and want to know who is backing you -
    <br>that evil power that is backing you.
    <br>That is why I cannot reply; I don't reply people, I don't reply flesh and blood.
    <br>I don't reply, I just look at you.
    <br>They say, "This man - they keep abusing him, he will not reply".
    <br>Whom will I reply?
    <br>Flesh and blood?
    <br>But I battle the spirit being that is pushing you to say this or that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But you keep busy, fighting your brother.
    <br>Your brother will say to you, 
    <br>"You are foolish".
    <br>"You call me foolish? You will see!"
    <br>It is not that your brother that calls you foolish.
    <br>Your brother cannot call you foolish, if there is no evil spirit behind him to say that.
    <br>You always engage in a failed battle.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “You engage in a failed battle”.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[You engage in a failed battle.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[You engage in a failed battle.]
    <br>The moment you become born again, then, satan hates you.
    <br>I am not saying, “The moment you become born again, then, your brother hates you”.
    <br>Did I say that?
    <br>"The moment you become born again, then, your husband hates you" - did I say that?
    <br>But that is the battle you are fighting.
    <br>You fight your husband, wife, uncle, cousin, the person... - no!
    <br>The moment you become born again, then, satan hates you the same as he hates Jesus.
    <br>The moment you are truly born again, you are engaged in a phenomenal battle.
    <br>If it had not been for the Lord
    <br>Who was always on my side
    <br>The enemy would have swallowed us
    <br>We would have drowned in their waters
    <br>But our souls have found an escape
    <br>A hiding place in You
    <br>The fowler’s snare is broken
    <br>Our help is in the name of the Lord
    <br>I’m nothing without You
    <br>You are the air that I breathe
    <br>Can’t live without You
    <br>In You I live and move and have my being
    <br>Hosanna to Jehovah
    <br>You are the air that I breathe
    <br>Hallelujah Hallelujah
    <br>In You I live and move and have my being
    <br>I’m nothing without You
    <br>You are the air that I breathe
    <br>Can’t live without You
    <br>In You I live and move and have my being
    <br>Without who?
    <br>Without your husband?
    <br>Without your wife?
    <br>Without T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Without your cousin?
    <br>Without your mentor?
    <br>Why are you fighting flesh and blood?
    <br>Why are you fighting a failed battle?
    <br>If you look at your record, all the battles you have been fighting -
    <br>in 90% of your battles you failed, because you are fighting a wrong battle.
    <br>Instead of fighting the spirit being that causes the tension and pressure, it is...
    <br>Oh, my God.
    <br>Failed battle.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The moment you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, truly,
    <br>then, satan hates you the same as he hates Jesus.
    <br>As you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, commitment asks Jesus to accept you.
    <br>Your faithfulness to Jesus, "My Lord, Jesus - my Saviour. I accept Jesus."
    <br>Before you can be accepted, commitment will be the one to ask Jesus to accept you.
    <br>Your faithfulness, your kindness, your obedience, love unconditional,
    <br>will be the one to ask Jesus to accept you.
    <br>Then, you become Jesus’ property.
    <br>The level at which satan attacks you seems to be equal to the level of your commitment to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The level at which satan attacks you seems to be equal to the level of your commitment to God.]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[The level at which satan attacks you seems to be equal to the level of your commitment to God.]
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>OUR COMMITMENT TO JESUS
    <br>If you are committed, Jesus will take up satan’s challenge against you.
    <br>What is satan’s challenge against you?
    <br>Stagnation, nightmare, weakness - Jesus will take it up.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>"If you are committed to God, Jesus will take up satan’s challenge against you."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Viewers, all over the world:
    <br>If truly you are committed to the Lord, you get involved in God’s projects,
    <br>Jesus will take up satan’s challenge against you
    <br>because we no longer belong to ourselves; we are servants.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It’s not by power
    <br>It’s not by might
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>This mountain has been removed
    <br>That is the challenge.
    <br>This mountain has been removed in Jesus' name
    <br>This mountain must be removed in Jesus’ name
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>The mountain is satan’s challenge.
    <br>Jesus will take it up.
    <br>Can you see - you sing the song, you don't know what you are saying.
    <br>This sickness, this affliction, this stagnation, this setback...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Before you...
    <br>You see many of them are here today.
    <br>Before they could come here, they had been to witch doctors.
    <br>Many have joined occultic practices, but when they realised that there is no way,
    <br>"Let me go and see that Jesus".
    <br>Many of us are here today, your potential – many have given this potential to satan.
    <br>It is counterfeit they are carrying to Jesus – counterfeit body.
    <br>When you had ..., you carried it to satan.
    <br>But now...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When you were ... - Hi" - you gave it to the world.
    <br>But now...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sometimes, when I see people, as if I should give you a "blow".
    <br>Each time I want to give a blow, Jesus will hold my hand.
    <br>I say, "Oh Jesus, let me give that blow. Why are they giving You this?
    <br>When they were like this, they were in the world!"
    <br>When your teeth were shining, you were in the world, but now your teeth are decayed.
    <br>When they say, "Praise God!", you see the teeth.
    <br>"My God!"
    <br>I say, "Look at the teeth. All these teeth are dirty".
    <br>The very fine teeth - satan has taken them.
    <br>Go and bring that fine teeth back.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
