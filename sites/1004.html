  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated. 
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The foolishness of satan is a strategy to separate the house and destroy the family.
    <br>That will take us to the message today: "Let go offence".
    <br>Let someone say, "Let go offence".
    <br>Viewers at home, thank you.
    <br>I want to greet the Church once again, "Good morning".
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, Jesus is there.
    <br>The state of our heart matters; Jesus is there.
    <br>We are there and you are also here.
    <br>The state of your heart matters.
    <br>The state of your heart must be the best.
    <br>We are going to take our message today from the Book of Luke 17.
    <br>The titles there are: sins, faith and duty.
    <br>Don't forget you are a spirit and I want to believe I am talking to a spirit.
    <br>Say, "I am a spirit; I live in a physical body".
    <br>Once you know that, you will not allow this physical body to control you.
    <br>Don't let whatever is outside to control you.
    <br>You allow your spirit to control you because your spirit is controlled by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Say to yourself again, "I am a spirit, living in a physical body".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(I am a spirit, living in a physical body.)
    <br>You are only learning to live in this natural world.
    <br>How to walk, how to talk, how to look...
    <br>You are learning to live in this natural world; you are a spirit.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>So, Luke 17 verse 1:
    <br>"Jesus said to His disciples, 'Things that cause people to stumble are bound to come'."
    <br>That is, it is impossible to avoid it.
    <br>It is just a declaration that it is impossible for you to live in this world without an offence, without being offended.
    <br>It is impossible.
    <br>So, how to handle this offence is the issue now.
    <br>Our response to offence determines our future.
    <br>We are going to look at the strategies satan, the enemy of our souls, uses to trap us,
    <br>get us and connect us to himself.
    <br>Demon's strategy.
    <br>As you listen, I see God touching your heart.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>That means you must listen; you have to give me your heart.
    <br>As you listen, I see Lord Jesus...
    <br>This is a vision; this is what I have seen already.
    <br>It has not happened but I have seen it happen.
    <br>You just need to listen now.
    <br>I see the Lord touching your heart, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>These are the strategies that satan, the enemy of our souls, uses.
    <br>His deceptive and deadly traps for us are hidden.
    <br>They are not open just like that.
    <br>He will not come to you saying he is satan or demon.
    <br>He will come as a friend but it is over to you to examine that friend, to know whether he is friend or enemy.
    <br>He always uses something we love, are attracted to, value and appreciate -
    <br>money, women to men, men to women, position, power.
    <br>That is satan.
    <br>He will not just come to you and say, "Hey!"
    <br>He will pretend to be your friend.
    <br>This is why the whole thing at the end will come as a surprise, "Ah, I never thought. Oh my God."
    <br>He comes under cover as an angel of light and peace.
    <br>It takes the spiritual strength and grace of one grounded in the Word of God to separate good from evil.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>It takes the spiritual strength and grace of one grounded in the Word of God
    <br>to identify the traps for what they are, to identify the tricks of satan for what they are.
    <br>If you are not grounded in the Word of God, you cannot just say, "Oh no, you are satan. Get behind me."
    <br>You must be grounded in the Word of God to be able to examine, differentiate and separate.
    <br>He comes under cover like an angel of light and peace.
    <br>Going by Luke 17 and 1 Corinthians 8:1, one of the most common traps used by satan is offence.
    <br>LET GO OFFENCE
    <br>It is impossible to live without being offended.
    <br>Because of that, he now uses that offence to get people.
    <br>For your information, honestly, offence in itself is not deadly.
    <br>Offence in itself is not deadly if we do not harbour it.
    <br>If we do not what?
    <br>(Harbour it.)
    <br>If you do not what?
    <br>(Harbour it.)
    <br>It is not deadly.
    <br>It becomes deadly if we hold or keep it in our hearts.
    <br>If you hold or keep offence in your heart, it becomes deadly.
    <br>When you keep offence in your heart, it produces so much fruit -
    <br>hurt, anger, bitterness, jealousy, outrage, resentment, hatred – just name it.
    <br>When you keep offence in your heart, it produces so much fruit such as hatred, anger,
    <br>unfaithfulness, rudeness, pride and so on and so forth.
    <br>Offence in itself is not deadly if we do not harbour or keep it.
    <br>In Luke 17, Jesus made it abundantly clear that it is impossible to live without being offended.
    <br>What does it mean?
    <br>It means we have to be ready, prepared and strongly armed for offence
    <br>because our response to it determines our future, determines your salvation.
    <br>When you are offended, it means you are not happy.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>"Amen" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>If someone says, "Amen!" and you are not happy - that is not for Jesus.
    <br>If you say, "Thank You, Jesus!" and you are not happy - it means it is not for Jesus.
    <br>If you say, "In Jesus' name!" and you are not happy - you are not talking to Jesus, you are talking to yourself.
    <br>When you are not happy, your spirit is imprisoned.
    <br>Jesus needs a free spirit.
    <br>It is a free spirit that can attract, have access to the Spirit of God.
    <br>When you are not happy, your spirit is imprisoned.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>Not being happy can affect your health, your relationship with others and with God -
    <br>whether you are the accused or the accuser.
    <br>The problem is that if we get offended, we hardly realise that we are trapped.
    <br>"No - it is the one that abused me. It is the one that insulted me. I cannot understand that little boy
    <br>insulting me just like that."
    <br>When we get offended, we hardly realise that we are trapped, imprisoned.
    <br>We believe that we are on the right side.
    <br>Whether you are on the right or wrong side, not being happy is not good; it imprisons our spirit.
    <br>The interest of satan is for us to focus on the wrong done to us, "Ha, he slapped me".
    <br>We forget the reality, which is the consequence of that offence – attack, unhappiness, pain.
    <br>That is his interest.
    <br>He wants us to focus on the wrong done to us and forget the reality.
    <br>That is satan.
    <br>He wants to focus on the wrong done to you and forget the reality.
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
    <br>It means blessed are those who are happy, who have a free spirit, for they shall see God.
    <br>If you are not happy, you cannot see God.
    <br>Whether you are wrong or right, accuser or accused, if you are not happy, you cannot see God.
    <br>Because you will focus on the wrong done to you and forget the reality.
    <br>Nowadays, we seem to experience so much division among believers, pastors, bishops,
    <br>the congregation, leaders in politics and business.
    <br>This is because there is a lack of real love.
    <br>The reason for this is that offence is so common, rampant.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>There is so much division among believers, leaders in politics and business,
    <br>professional gurus and the congregation.
    <br>The reason is offence is so rampant due to lack of real love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Offence is so rampant due to lack of real love".
    <br>There is love but not real love.
    <br>The love we are talking about, the love of Christ, is not the love they play in politics.
    <br>Political parties A, B, and C will not allow the real love of Christ to be among themselves.
    <br>The reason for this is that offence is so common due to lack of real love.
    <br>Real love forgets wrong, so that there will be a future.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Real love forgets wrong, so that there will be a future."
    <br>The challenges you are facing today – no love, no future.
    <br>The world - no love, no future.
    <br>See what is happening all over the world - war, attacks.
    <br>No real love, no future.
    <br>In the face of real, genuine love, offence cannot stand.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "In the face of real, genuine love, offence cannot stand."
    <br>What is offence in the face of real and genuine love?
    <br>For those of you who know the importance of the future, you dare hold offence.
    <br>We don't know the importance of future; you just want to live and enjoy today.
    <br>Each time you are enjoying yourself now, remember what will happen tomorrow.
    <br>Let me advise you:
    <br>it is impossible to establish a healthy relationship
    <br>with a person who has left one relationship bitter and offended.
    <br>When you divorce and marry another person, you will likely divorce again and marry another person -
    <br>unless you look into the root of that divorce - whether it had been settled or not.
    <br>It is impossible to establish a healthy, good, wonderful relationship
    <br>with a person who has left a relationship bitter and offended.
    <br>This is why you keep having broken homes, relationships with your business partners;
    <br>you don't have any genuine friends.
    <br>And you cannot achieve anything alone; you need good, inspired, informed people - but you can't get them.
    <br>If you leave a relationship bitter and offended,
    <br>you will enter the next relationship with that same attitude.
    <br>So, you can see reason why you keep having problems with your business partner.
    <br>Your business partner left previous relationship bitter and offended,
    <br>you too, you left previous relationship bitter and offended;
    <br>and you people come together to have a relationship that cannot work, unless both of you are healed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our offences can hold us in bondage.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>You can see why you are in bondage.
    <br>Because you left a relationship bitter and offended, you can never have any healthy relationship.
    <br>The Bible says, "Peace will enter relationship and we walk out of relationship with joy".
    <br>Situation should not break the relationship, no matter what happened,
    <br>but God that joined the relationship should be the One to separate you people.
    <br>It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship
    <br>with a person who has left a relationship bitter and offended.
    <br>Healthy relationship means good relationship.
    <br>If you are looking for a good relationship, make sure you meet someone
    <br>who did not leave a relationship bitter and offended.
    <br>That is why it is difficult for couples.
    <br>Out of ten marriages six hardly hold.
    <br>If you leave a relationship bitter and offended, go back and do the right thing.
    <br>You can leave a relationship with peace.
    <br>If you leave a relationship bitter and offended, you will enter the next relationship with the same attitude.
    <br>Sometimes, you will see me very quiet.
    <br>All what they've been saying about me for the past thirty years, "I'm this or that" - I will not talk.
    <br>This is the reason.
    <br>I have been very careful.
    <br>You can abuse me, tell all sorts of things about me; I will not talk - I will leave myself for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Someone who is a devil, pain to you today may be a saviour tomorrow.
    <br>You can be whatever you are to me today.
    <br>If you turn to be a devil today, I will look beyond you to see what you may become tomorrow.
    <br>Tomorrow is a mystery.
    <br>Relationships - be careful.
    <br>The person who is your enemy today can be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>If you continue to use the actions of people today to judge them, you may have problems in the future.
    <br>"The man is very bad. The woman is very bad." - because they are very bad you take action;
    <br>you will likely have problems tomorrow.
    <br>You will receive in a moment what you have been seeking for years the moment you let offence go.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, holding a grudge against your neighbour -
    <br>you have already grieved the Holy Spirit -
    <br>because you are a spirit, living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world.
    <br>Say to yourself, "I am a spirit, living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world".
    <br>If you are a spirit, why are you now fighting your brother?
    <br>Our battle is not against flesh and blood.
    <br>Your brother is of blood and flesh.
    <br>You are a spirit and your battle is not against flesh and blood but against sprit-beings.
    <br>Pressure and tension.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Why are you fighting your brothers?"
    <br>They are flesh and blood and your battle is not against flesh and blood.
    <br>You are a spirit, living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have to let the world know you are a spirit by acting this way,
    <br>by not fighting flesh and blood.
    <br>If your brother says, "I will deal with you", you say to yourself, "I'm a spirit; how can you deal with a spirit?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can you deal with a spirit? 
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>You can't hold or touch the spirit.
    <br>Where will you see and fight the spirit?
    <br>You can only fight the flesh and blood.
    <br>Jesus made abundantly clear that it is impossible to live in this world without being offended.
    <br>Offence will come – don't harbour it.
    <br>Offence in itself is not deadly.
    <br>It will come; don't harbour it.
    <br>It is when you harbour offence and keep it in your heart it produces
    <br>anger, hatred, resentment, outrage and strife.
    <br>Once it produces hurt and anger, you are not happy any longer.
    <br>"Hallelujah" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>Not being happy can affect your relationship with God, with others and your health.
    <br>Be happy.
    <br>For you to be happy, you must trust God's authority more than man's majority.
    <br>I want to believe you are free now.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>- Are you free?
    <br>- (Yes!)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This response actually comes from a happy heart.
    <br>- Are you free?
    <br>- (Yes!)
    <br>(I am free!)
    <br>What do you mean by "you are free"?
    <br>I'm free in my heart.
    <br>By the spirit in my heart.
    <br>- By the spirit?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>I want to believe you listen to the voice of your spirit because it is controlled by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You have to feed your spirit; your spirit is hungry.
    <br>You are always feeding your flesh and you are a spirit.
    <br>Hunger wants to kill your spirit.
    <br>All this food you eat is not for your spirit, it is for your flesh.
    <br>You have to feed your spirit by allowing the Word of God.
    <br>Read the Word of God, meditate in it and keep it in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The prophetic word God gave me is that He would touch your heart with this message.
    <br>I can see your heart has been touched.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are many people you don't want to hear from.
    <br>Give them a phone call; just say, "Hi, I pray with you, I love you."
    <br>That word will go a long way.
    <br>The spiritual strength and grace of one grounded in the Word of God can identify good from evil,
    <br>separate good from evil and identify his traps for what they are.
    <br>You cannot just say, "I'm free".
    <br>Right now, start reconciliation and stop focusing on the wrong they have done to you.
    <br>Satan wants you to focus on the wrong people have done to you.
    <br>People should tell you...
    <br>There are many of us here that keep one, two or three persons in the prison.
    <br>You sentenced them to prison.
    <br>Find time to go to the prison and say you want to see such and such person.
    <br>By the time you enter you say, "You know me. Please, I want to pray with you."
    <br>Begin to think how you can release such person from the prison.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When you leave here...
    <br>There are many persons that are in a prison because they have truly wronged you, they did evil to you.
    <br>Look for their custody and pay them a visit.
    <br>Enter the prison, wait for the person, counsel the person, pray with the person, and tell the person
    <br>that right from this moment you want this person to walk out, so they can release this person.
    <br>Drop the case.
    <br>Those things are not good for your future.
    <br>They Lord says, "I will set a table before you in the presence of the people you have imprisoned."
    <br>If you put them in the prison or kill, destroy them...
    <br>By the time God set a table they will not be there and He promised He would set a table for you
    <br>in the presence of these people that you had put in prison.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I will set a table before you in the presence of who?"
    <br>This enemy - you are killing, destroying, sending them to prison because of the position you have
    <br>and the right, the law of your nation, your country, many had been sentenced to death, to prison, killed...
    <br>So, by the time God set that table before you, in the presence of who?
    <br>... people you have killed.
    <br>People you have destroyed.
    <br>That is why this table is being delayed for many of us here.
    <br>By now, many of us would have enjoying this table,
    <br>but when the Lord realised that you had killed, destroyed a lot of your enemies
    <br>or you had sent them to prison - the table is unnecessary.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Change the kind of prayer you offer, "Die die die" - don't kill them, let them live
    <br>and see the table the Lord will set before you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take effort and begin to release those who you call an enemy wherever they are;
    <br>in the prison, wherever - meet them, counsel them, leave them.
    <br>Please, it is very important for your future.
    <br>For your future, forgiveness is very important.
    <br>For your future, release of your enemies is very important.
    <br>God bless you.
