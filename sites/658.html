    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are great yes You are Holy One
    <br>You walked upon the sea and You raised the dead
    <br>Great in majesty Holy God
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great yes You are Holy One
    <br>You walked upon the sea and You raised the dead
    <br>Great in majesty Holy God
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great yes You are mighty God
    <br>You walked upon the sea and You raised the dead
    <br>Great in majesty Holy God
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You have seen that God is reliable and when you know He is reliable, you have to trust Him.
    <br>You have to put your trust in Him.
    <br>With all what you have seen, Jesus is what?
    <br>He is reliable.
    <br>There is so much worry and upset; there is one thing that is needed - God's agenda.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can just be worried without even knowing what is worrying you.
    <br>If I'm talking to you...
    <br>You just feel upset and worried but you can't just say the exact thing that is worrying you.
    <br>Worry and anxiety.
    <br>Sometimes you have so much money - no debt, yet you are worried.
    <br>So much friends that can help you, yet, worries.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are too demanding
    <br>and what we are demanding is in the Word of God.
    <br>For you to be able to leave it for God and stop worrying, you must be grounded in God's Word.
    <br>If you ask your colleague, "What is worrying you?", he will not be able to tell you.
    <br>We have many people here that have faith, no sickness, no disease, but yet, they are worried.
    <br>Do you know who are the most worried people?
    <br>The rich people.
    <br>People who are affluent, have everything they need - they are the most worried people.
    <br>And everybody wants to be rich.
    <br>So, you will soon be worried.
    <br>That's the prayer that you want to have surplus, you just want to have everything in abundance.
    <br>You want to stop counting your money because you know how much you have.
    <br>Even the one in your pocket, you know if one coin is missing, "Ah! Who stole my money?"
    <br>because you have limited amount of money.
    <br>You take your time to count - even the money in the bank.
    <br>If a banker does some nonsense, you will say, "No, this is what I have withdrawn so far"
    <br>because you have limited amount of money.
    <br>You don't want to count your things again - you just want to give.
    <br>God doesn't count before giving you.
    <br>If God wants to bless you, He will not count, "One, two, three - take it" - that is not God
    <br>because He is rich beyond your grave.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He will not count, "One, two, three - five dollars - have it".
    <br>He doesn't count before giving you but when they give you, you count.
    <br>When you want to give, you count.
    <br>When you receive, you count.
    <br>If it was possible, you would also have counted how much happiness you have.
    <br>Can you count your happiness?
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Word of God.
    <br>LET GOD TALK TO US
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let God talk to me".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Let God talk to me.]
    <br>Let God talk to me.
    <br>It is like you have not been hearing from God.
    <br>You talk to God but you never hear from Him.
    <br>You don't even know whether He hears you.
    <br>We can't continue talking to a God we do not know.
    <br>Let's look at the Book of Matthew 5; let's take a look at the verse 8 there.
    <br>I will not take you too far; verse 8:
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God."
    <br>And I know those who are pure in the heart will be very happy now.
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God."
    <br>When you watch Emmanuel TV all the time,
    <br>you will know that the greatest thing God looks at is the heart.
    <br>Not that He does not value other things, faculties - He loves every
    <br>but the greatest thing that God looks at is the heart.
    <br>This means, true Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>You know, you pray in the morning; every time you pray.
    <br>As Christians, we see it as a normal life
    <br>but we never know that prayer is a two-way conversation.
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>Prayer is a two-way conversation.
    <br>You talk to God and God talks to you.
    <br>God listens as you are praying and replies accordingly.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As you pray, "In Jesus'..." - He has listened and replies accordingly.
    <br>By 'accordingly', I mean the state of your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>When you were coming to the church, you took care of your body.
    <br>Since yesterday or beginning of the week,
    <br>many of us were ironing the dresses they wanted to wear,
    <br>the kind of make-up, attire, shoes you want to wear,
    <br>failing to take care of the greatest God requires,
    <br>failing to consider the greatest that God looks at.
    <br>God does not look at your attire, He does not mind about your appearance
    <br>but He's looking to your heart.
    <br>The heart is the contact point, communication point between the visible and invisible,
    <br>between the immaterial and material world.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Are you holding grudges?
    <br>Are you holding an offence?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>If it is not in the heart, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If it is not in the heart, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>If you talk to me, "Good Morning, sir" and it is not from your heart,
    <br>you are deceiving me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you say, "In the name of Jesus",
    <br>if it is not in your heart, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you read your Bible, the Word of God, without offence, you are talking to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you read your Bible, the Word of God, without offence, you are talking to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together.
    <br>One is not complete without the other.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>One is not complete without the other.
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will receive in a moment what you have been seeking for years,
    <br>the moment you let your offence go.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>You will receive what you have been seeking for years, the moment you let go of your offence.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[You will receive what you have been seeking for years, the moment you let go of your offence.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[You will receive what you have been seeking for years, the moment you let go of your offence.]
    <br>What you have been seeking for years, you will receive in a moment,
    <br>the moment you let go of your offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Offence is the wall between us and God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is WALL - the wall between...
    <br>When there is a wall, someone is here, another person is here -
    <br>when you are talking, the person there cannot hear you.
    <br>The wall between us and God caused by offence.
    <br>LET GOD TALK TO YOU
    <br>God has not been talking to you - don't deceive yourself.
    <br>That is why you always get frustrated.
    <br>You are looking for assistance from earthly people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remember the question I asked.
    <br>We are upset and worried about many things and many of these, we don't know the cause.
    <br>What we need is only God's agenda.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The question: What is God's agenda for you?
    <br>If you know God's agenda...
    <br>You are going this way, and you are taking this side - where are you going?
    <br>You go back again.
    <br>This is where you are going
    <br>and you are here.
    <br>What does it take you to go straight?
    <br>But because you don't know God's agenda for your life, you go this way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Back again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What we are facing is also what our children are facing.
    <br>The direction we follow in our life is the direction we are showing them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why there are so many generational curses.
    <br>What happened in the family keeps repeating in the life of children and grand-children.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We don't know God's agenda for our life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God."
    <br>Take this summary:
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together.
    <br>One is not complete without the other.
    <br>When you read your Bible without offence, you are talking to God.
    <br>I mean, God is listening as you are praying and replies accordingly.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God bless His Word.
