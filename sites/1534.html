  <p>    
    <br>Since the beginning of the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>many people have taken it upon themselves to go about spreading blasphemy,
    <br>lies, slanderous remarks and malicious false rumours concerning the man of God,
    <br>in order to deceive the masses.
    <br>Some have taken their blasphemy to newspapers, tabloids and magazines.
    <br>Others, through word of mouth and others who go to large public gatherings,
    <br>meetings and places of worship to make false accusations and claims
    <br>about Prophet T.B. Joshua and his ministry, The SCOAN.
    <br>This is one of the places of worship that started this rumour-mongering
    <br>concerning Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is one of the places that sparked the whole thing off over 10 years ago.
    <br>This is one of the women who went to public meeting places and places of worship
    <br>to create prejudice and false impressions concerning the person of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>through her blasphemous, false confessions.
    <br>Let us watch.
    <br>My names are Julius Babatunde Kumoluyi Dada.
    <br>My mother's name is Abigail.
    <br>Write it down and confirm if the power I am using is of God.
    <br>When you were in the marine kingdom, where did you hold your meetings?
    <br>In a river in Calabar (Cross River State, Nigeria).
    <br>How many of you are holding the meeting at Calabar?
    <br>We are many.
    <br>We are about 40 in number.
    <br>But there are still some prophets and elders
    <br>who I want to use to teach those who still run after fake prophets a lesson.
    <br>They are the ones that I went in search of and this search led me to
    <br>The SCOAN to give Prophet T.B. Joshua power.
    <br>The woman claims that she would attend witchcraft meetings under the water in Calabar,
    <br>a city in River State, in the southern part of Nigeria.
    <br>In her confession, she said that her search to find fake prophets led her to The SCOAN,
    <br>where she gave Prophet T.B. Joshua power.
    <br>Synagogue? What kind of power is T.B. Joshua using there?
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>Are you ready to confess?
    <br>Start confessing now!
    <br>Temitope is our child.
    <br>Who is Temitope?
    <br>The crowd shouted, "Temitope is the man in The Synagogue."
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>Who gave him power?
    <br>We are the ones that gave him power.
    <br>She said that Prophet T.B. Joshua was a child to her occultic group.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>This power in your hair...
    <br>continue to confess.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>Let us pray that this power should be reversed.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>Everybody, have your seat.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>How many powers did you give the man in The Synagogue?
    <br>We gave him seven powers.
    <br>Because my own power is from above,
    <br>I invoke the spirit of the man in The Synagogue to come down to this place now!
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>I command the spirit of the man in The Synagogue to come down right now in my presence.
    <br>I want to speak to him now.
    <br>He states that his power is from above, therefore he starts to command and invoke the spirit
    <br>of the man in The Synagogue, Prophet T.B. Joshua to come to his presence so that he could speak with him.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>Where is he now?
    <br>See him here.
    <br>I still can't see him.
    <br>You ground, listen to the Word of God!
    <br>Let the ground be opened!
    <br>After some time, the woman claims that the spirit of Prophet T.B. Joshua is in their midst
    <br>and that she can see him standing in front of her.
    <br>In response, the pastor quickly moves forward and hits the ground in front of her,
    <br>commanding the ground to listen to the Word of God and saying,
    <br>"You ground, be opened."
    <br>Be calm and see the salvation of God!
    <br>Lord, these people have not seen anything and they are shouting.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>Stop him!
    <br>Command him not to go.
    <br>See him standing.
    <br>Command him to wait.
    <br>Bow down.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>Hey, he must not go.
    <br>The man in The Synagogue must not leave that place.
    <br>Command him not to go.
    <br>I am looking at his spirit.
    <br>Next, he begins to chant.
    <br>Taking off his shoes, he continues to hit the floor in front of the woman,
    <br>where he claims the spirit of T.B. Joshua is standing.
    <br>He then tells the possessed woman to command the spirit of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to stay in their presence, that she should not allow him to go.
    <br>The woman in turn puts on a dramatic act, raising her arm
    <br>and telling the so-called spirit of Prophet T.B. Joshua to bow down.
    <br>Host of Heaven, continue with this battle at hand now.
    <br>Synagogue, I invoke your spirit right now.
    <br>What is the covenant you made with him and
    <br>what is the covenant he made with you?
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>He made a covenant with me that he will not have more than one child.
    <br>You said the man in The Synagogue must not have more that one child?
    <br>- How many children does he have now?
    <br>- He has just one child.
    <br>What other covenant did he make with you?
    <br>He must not use good clothes if he wants a large crowd in his church.
    <br>What kind of clothes is he putting on?
    <br>He is putting on rubbish clothes.
    <br>What other covenant did he make with you?
    <br>The other covenant is that he must not make love with any woman.
    <br>How many powers did you give the man in The Synagogue?
    <br>We gave him seven powers.
    <br>He continues to wildly chant and then commands the Host of Heaven
    <br>to continue with the battle at hand.
    <br>He asked the woman more questions about the covenant that she claims
    <br>that Prophet T.B. Joshua made with her,
    <br>and the covenant that she claims she made with him.
    <br>The woman replies that Prophet T.B. Joshua made a covenant with her
    <br>that he would not have more than one child.
    <br>The second covenant saying that he must not wear good clothes, so that his church can be full.
    <br>She states that T.B. Joshua made a covenant that he would not make love with any woman,
    <br>and in exchange for all this she gave him seven powers.
    <br>This private part I am seeing, whose is it?
    <br>The man in The Synagogue's.
    <br>His manhood is very small.
    <br>When you met him and you made love together,
    <br>how did his manhood look like?
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>He has made love with her and his manhood is very small.
    <br>The Holy Spirit told me that they made love together
    <br>and his manhood is very small.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>Host of Heaven, strip the man in The Synagogue naked.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Pastor 'ARRESTS' TB Joshua In His Church!!! ðŸ˜³
    <br>How many powers did you give him in his pubic hair?
    <br>We gave him three powers.
    <br>The woman continues to falsely confess that she had an affair with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and gave him three powers in his private parts.
    <br>The power you gave the man in The Synagogue in his manhood, what should he use it for?
    <br>He cannot make love with any woman again.
    <br>When he made love with you and you became pregnant,
    <br>did you give birth to the baby?
    <br>I didn't get pregnant.
    <br>He called himself a prophet then.
    <br>Where did you meet then?
    <br>We met at first in Ilesha (Osun, Nigeria).
    <br>He had not received power then?
    <br>He was a prophet then.
    <br>What kind of power was he using then?
    <br>Then he had no power.
    <br>How many powers did you then give to him?
    <br>I did not give him power then.
    <br>Then he was just fasting for power.
    <br>He came to my house and he told me that they said I was a witch.
    <br>He said that the elder said it.
    <br>So, I asked him what he wanted.
    <br>He said he wanted power.
    <br>I gave him the power and I asked him to make a covenant with me.
    <br>Before he asked for the power, he told me that he loved me,
    <br>that he wanted to marry me.
    <br>I said, "You, a prophet?"
    <br>So, I asked him if he could take care of me. He said, "Yes."
    <br>I told him that I was not interested.
    <br>He left but later came back to meet me, prostrate before me and beg me,
    <br>that it was the power that he needed.
    <br>- Did you give him the power?
    <br>- I gave him the power.
    <br>Where did you give him the power?
    <br>Was it inside the water or in a dream?
    <br>I gave him the power in a dream.
    <br>Did he sleep with you that day?
    <br>No, I went to his church and gave him the power.
    <br>She claims that she first met Prophet T.B. Joshua in Ilesa, in Osun State, Nigeria
    <br>and that then Prophet T.B. Joshua said that he was a prophet but that he had no power.
    <br>She further confessed that upon his request she gave him power
    <br>and asked him to make a covenant with her.
    <br>The woman says that she went to the church and transferred the power to him in a dream.
    <br>Imagine the thousands of people, who having heard these kinds of rumours
    <br>would then go back to where they live.
    <br>Many would even go beyond the State of Lagos with such negative impressions.
    <br>He used his only child to make a covenant with us.
    <br>Why?
    <br>He made a covenant with us that if I give him the power
    <br>and he pulls a large crowd, he would donate his child.
    <br>They said he built his house in a bush in Agodo Egbe. Is it true?
    <br>And I heard that water flows through the house.
    <br>Is he the one that built the house?
    <br>We are the ones that built the house for him.
    <br>She states that Prophet T.B. Joshua made a covenant with them,
    <br>that if he was able to pull a large crowd in his church
    <br>that he would donate his only child to the occultic group that she was a part of.
    <br>Finally, he says that he had heard that Prophet T.B. Joshua built his house in a swampy place.
    <br>She replied saying that they were the ones who built it for him.
    <br>Satan wants us to take all we hear without questioning
    <br>but God wants us to examine all things in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Beware of blasphemers.
    <br>Find out the truth and the truth shall set you free.
    <br>This is one the many places of worship where they publicly confess negative things
    <br>about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>In the next edition of this programme we shall bring to you some more of the worst confessions
    <br>made in other worship places.
    <br>BEWARE OF BLASPHEMERS
    <br>After the woman had given her confession,
    <br>claiming to have given Prophet T.B. Joshua evil power,
    <br>let's listen to what the pastor of the worship centre had to say.
    <br>If we examine topics like this, they do not promote the gospel.
    <br>It is not decent for me to discuss about such things.
    <br>God has called me to save people.
    <br>It is true I conduct a revival service every month in my church in Ketu.
    <br>If you watch the video, you will see that immediately God arrested her, she started confessing.
    <br>I delivered her so that she could be free from all the evil spirits.
    <br>When God arrests people with an evil spirit, it is our duty to deliver them.
    <br>I didn't know her before. If you watch the video, you will see that I asked her...
    <br>I don't even know Temitope Joshua.
    <br>It was when she was mentioning his name that I asked her who Temitope Joshua was
    <br>and the crowd answered, "Synagogue."
    <br>I have not come to destroy anyone's church in order to sustain mine.
    <br>It is God that called me and Joshua has also said that God called him.
    <br>He is the one to account for all his deeds.
    <br>When we look at the book of Matthew 7:1, I cannot judge T.B. Joshua.
    <br>If he faces any challenges, as someone who calls himself a servant of God,
    <br>he can write me a letter or send someone to me so that we can iron things out.
    <br>I have not come to destroy his church.
    <br>God called him and God called me as well.
    <br>Everyone will give account to God on the last day.
    <br>The book of Revelation 22:11-12 says:
    <br>"He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still;
    <br>He who is righteous, let him be righteous still; He who is Holy, let him be Holy still.
    <br>And behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me,
    <br>to give to everyone according to his work."
    <br>I regret about everything and leave it for God.
    <br>He should continue his ministry and also talk to his members.
    <br>There is not need to speak negatively about each other.
    <br>It is not to pull down someone's house and use the materials to build mine.
    <br>The Bible did not send us to do that but to preach the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>He should talk to his members and I will also do the same so that there will be no problems.
    <br>Everyone should mind his or her own business.
    <br>We shall all give an account when we leave this world.
