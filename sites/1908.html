  <p>    
    <br>Here is the SCOAN's prayer line, where people have come from all over the world
    <br>just to receive a touch from Jesus Christ,
    <br>believing that He will put an end to their suffering.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is demonstrating that the Jesus Christ he knows
    <br>is Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Right now, we can see sickness and demons going out
    <br>because Prophet T.B. Joshua has commanded them to go, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Here is Linda Marsh from the USA, who has come to The SCOAN
    <br>with the problems of heart disease and severe depression.
    <br>Here we can see her testifying to the glory of God in her life.
    <br>Let us see how the miracle took place.
    <br>Linda Marsh is seated at the prayer line section, at The SCOAN in a desperate situation.
    <br>She is demonstrating how she normally uses the oxygen mask
    <br>she has been depending on for so long.
    <br>Unable to breathe properly without this peace of equipment,
    <br>she cannot live a normal life.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua instructs Linda Marsh to remove the mask
    <br>because he knows that in Jesus Christ we have victory over sickness and disease.
    <br>Christ's victory gives us victory.
    <br>We can see Prophet T.B. Joshua giving her words of encouragement and assurance
    <br>that the truth will set her free today
    <br>and that God can make a way where there seems to be no way.
    <br>"I CAN BREATHE NOW!!!" | USA Citizen 'Hugged' Back To Life!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, be healed!
    <br>What a means of blessing, healing, deliverance and freedom
    <br>is the look of faith to Christ Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The man of God has declared her free.
    <br>I came here for the man of God to lay his hands on me
    <br>because I knew God was going to heal me in this place. Hallelujah!
    <br>By faith I got on that plane and I flew over here because I knew God was going to heal me.
    <br>I feel so good; I am able to breathe!
    <br>Until you have had problem, you don't know.
    <br>Every time you take a step, it's hard to breathe.
    <br>I have had to use all these instruments.
    <br>I have had to use all kinds of medicine that have bad side effects and cause other problems.
    <br>They told me I would be on medication the rest of my life but I praise God, I can breathe!

    <br>There is no shortness of breath and I am not dizzy!
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Linda Marsh and I am from United States.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN because of heart and lung problems.
    <br>I had been using oxygen every night
    <br>and it was very hard for me to move around and breathe without being on the oxygen at night.
    <br>I had to take two to three or even four breathing treatments a day.
    <br>I couldn't stand being outside in the heat.
    <br>I couldn't do a lot of walking.
    <br>I had to have people help me to get around.
    <br>I came for the Lord to touch me and for Prophet T.B. Joshua to pray for me.
    <br>I thank God that ever since I was prayed for the other night, I have not used the oxygen.
    <br>I haven't used any breathing treatments.
    <br>You can tell it is hot and I am walking a lot better; I thank God for touching me.
    <br>I just give God all the glory!
    <br>Could you tell us what you had to do with this?
    <br>You are not on it now.
    <br>Have you taken any medicine since you were prayed for?
    <br>I haven't had any oxygen or any breathing treatments at all.
    <br>And you can now climb up the stairs.
    <br>I have had to climb up and down the steps and it seems like it gets a little bit easier every time.
    <br>What was your experience in the prayer line, when the Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you,
    <br>in the name of Jesus?
    <br>I felt like the breath of God just came into me!
    <br>[Hallelujah!]
    <br>That's how I felt.
    <br>I just love Him more, I just praise God.
    <br>I knew God was going to touch me if I came over here.
    <br>Some friends had asked for me to come but I was so sick that I was really afraid to make the trip.
    <br>I thank God that He made a way for me to be here among the people
    <br>to see the glory of God.
    <br>I truly thank Him. He has changed my life.
    <br>I know my family, when I get off that plane, are going to know that God has changed me,
    <br>touched me and healed me for His glory.
    <br>What would be your testimony, what would you tell them?
    <br>I am going to tell them - just look at me!
    <br>I am a testimony in myself!
    <br>My doctors had done all they could do for me.
    <br>The diagnosis they had given me was that it was only going to get worse.
    <br>My mother died with emphysema and I watched her die little by little.
    <br>My doctors told me I was not going to get any better.
    <br>As a matter of fact, my doctors did not want me to come over here.
    <br>As a matter of fact, one of my doctors told me when I get back to the USA,
    <br>they were going to give me an IQ test to check me mentally.
    <br>We know Jesus though is the great Physician.
    <br>That's right.
    <br>- Not the practising physician, right?
    <br>- Right.
    <br>What is your promise and confession?
    <br>I confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour
    <br>and I will go and sin no more!
    <br>Amen. We believe you will keep that healing based on your confession of faith in Jesus Christ.
    <br>- Amen?
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua did not ask for anything from us before praying for us.
    <br>He never asked for any money or anything.
    <br>The food that I have received here has been free.
    <br>They have let me sleep and they have taken good care of me here.
    <br>It's all been without charge and I give God the glory!
