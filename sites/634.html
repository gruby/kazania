    <br>Viewers, anywhere you are, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Right now, begin to order anything that has to do with hardship,
    <br>that has to do with hindrance,
    <br>that has to do with shortcoming,
    <br>that has to do with waste,
    <br>that has to do with setback.
    <br>Order them in your life!
    <br>Order them in your career!
    <br>Order them in your business!
    <br>Order them in your finances!
    <br>Order them.  Begin to order them out!
    <br>Order them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I order you out, you setback in my way, you shortcoming in my business,
    <br>you waste, you hardship, you poverty in my way, in my career,
    <br>I order you out, in my life, my way, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
