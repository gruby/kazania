    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>Hallelujah! You are welcome, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Please tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Miss Estella Mutale, I come from Zambia.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>In 2008, I started feeling strange - rashes all over my body, sicknesses, everything in my body.
    <br>I lost appetite.
    <br>I saw rashes all over my body.
    <br>In 2008, I went to the hospital, and I was tested to have HIV/AIDS Positive 1.
    <br>I went back home and told my family about it.
    <br>My son introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Hallelujah !
    <br>So, we can understand where our sister is coming from.
    <br>She had the problem of HIV/AIDS Positive 1.
    <br>We just want you to lay a bit more emphasis on how this problem affected your life.
    <br>How did you feel when the doctors told you that you had HIV/AIDS?
    <br>I felt bad. I was lying down throughout the day and the night
    <br>because the doctor had told me that there was no cure for this disease.
    <br>I was afraid that I would die at any moment.
    <br>What were the symptoms you had over the years because of this HIV/AIDS?
    <br>Fornication and adultery.
    <br>You mean that was the cause?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But what we were asking is: How did HIV affect you and your health?
    <br>What were those problems you had because of HIV?
    <br>It was affecting me.
    <br>I was a business lady. I couldn't do anything.
    <br>I was always bedridden.
    <br>It caused me dejection, and I had the spirit of fear.
    <br>If I went out and took a bus, a voice would be telling me that I would die.
    <br>Then, my son introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV 24/7.
    <br>One fateful day, I saw a lady from Botswana testifying of being healed from HIV/AIDS.
    <br>So, I was encouraged and my faith started growing.
    <br>I decided to come to The SCOAN in 2015.
    <br>The man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Two days after Prophet T.B. Joshua had prayed for me,  everything - rashes, sicknesses - disappeared.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We can see on the screen, the moment our sister received prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>That evil spirit that was behind her sickness of HIV/AIDS started manifesting.
    <br>During that time of deliverance, what was your experience?
    <br>I am okay, everything (of HIV) disappeared.
    <br>Then, I went back home to my country Zambia.
    <br>In January 2016, I went back to the same hospital.
    <br>Which hospital was that?
    <br>University Teaching Hospital in Zambia.
    <br>They tested me to be HIV/AIDS negative.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Truly, with God, nothing is impossible. Amen!
    <br>If you know God Almighty is going to turn your impossibility into possibility,
    <br>put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Since you were re-tested (HIV) negative by the grace of God, after the prayer from the man of God,
    <br>how is your life now and how are you feeling?
    <br>I feel very happy.
    <br>I am okay!
    <br>What about the rashes you used to have? What about your job? Have you gone back to work?
    <br>Everything disappeared, I am okay.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus once again!
    <br>Have you gone back to your job? And how is your business now, after your healing?
    <br>During that sickness of HIV/AIDS, I had the spirit of setback, rejection,
    <br>everything I put my hands on would not work.
    <br>But now, after the deliverance, how have things changed in your business?
    <br>Everything has changed.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!
    <br>We can see some documents on the board next to you.
    <br>Can you explain to us one by one what they are?
    <br>The first one is the HIV/AIDS Positive 1 test result: Confirmed to be HIV/Positive 1.
    <br>After the prayer from the man of God, I went back to the hospital and I was tested to be HIV/AIDS negative.
    <br>I was tested negative on everything.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ, the Master Healer!
    <br>This was in 2016. In 2017, the HIV/AIDS test result also came out negative.
    <br>Hallelujah! God is good, all the time!
    <br>We want to hear your word of advice to people watching you all over the world.
    <br>People all over the world, especially to single ladies like me, my advice is that you should stay away from sin.
    <br>Stay faithful to God.
    <br>Secondly, keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Madam, we thank God Almighty for this wonderful healing that God has done in your life.
    <br>We encourage you to continue to make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>And this healing will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
