    <br>Good Morning and Win Today!
    <br>Viewers, glory be to God!
    <br>We are happy to announce to you today the introduction of a new programme on Emmanuel TV:
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER
    <br>INTERACTIVE PRAYER SESSIONS
    <br>This is another grace God is giving us because of so many emails, phone calls and text messages
    <br>we have been receiving.
    <br>T.B. Joshua would love to come out every day on Emmanuel TV
    <br>but all of this has become so much for him to attend to
    <br>along with other issues such as the administration of the church.
    <br>So now, God has given us the grace to see you face to face.
    <br>Nothing makes it different from being in The SCOAN
    <br>and receiving a physical touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Take for example this woman who has called in for prayer.
    <br>She is in Zambia but she could be anywhere in the world.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier!
    <br>God has no hands but our hands to touch.
    <br>But God does not necessarily need human hands to do His work.
    <br>She is there to receive prayer.
    <br>Whether at a distance on my seat I stretch my hand towards her
    <br>or I stand and touch the screen, I am touching her.
    <br>There is no difference.
    <br>God is more majestic in distance.
    <br>What you see happening in The SCOAN and on Emmanuel TV is what you will see happen now,
    <br>and even better because God is more powerful in distance.
    <br>You will witness as people receive prayer, they will fall, they will manifest, they will vomit poisonous substances
    <br>as God wills.
    <br>Now, we want to show you one of us here as a good example of what I'm talking to you about.
    <br>Remember, what you see happen in The SCOAN is exactly what you will see happen here.
    <br>Let us watch the video.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>You are welcome in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please introduce yourself to us, your name and where you are from.
    <br>I am Sharon from Zambia.
    <br>What is the problem you are having that you would like prayer for?
    <br>I'm asthmatic.
    <br>Explain some of the challenges you have faced as a result of this asthma.
    <br>I need to be very cautious of where I am.
    <br>There are certain things that I'm not supposed to do because I might trigger an attack.
    <br>I have had it since I was young; I inherited it from my late mum.
    <br>It has affected my academics badly because sometimes, I would have to abscond from school
    <br>so that I could go for injections or take my medication.
    <br>We are seeing you holding an inhaler; can you explain more about this?
    <br>This is what I use when I have the attack.
    <br>When it's severe, I use this to help me breathe.
    <br>We can see you demonstrating how you would use that, because of the asthma.
    <br>This is what the doctors have given you to assist you in this condition.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We want to let you know first and foremost that with Jesus Christ, all things are possible.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In fact, God is even more powerful in distance
    <br>because He is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent.
    <br>So, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Nowhere.
    <br>He is even more effective in distance, but it depends on the state of your heart.
    <br>I want to ask you, Sharon: Is your heart at its best for God?
    <br>Is your heart free and ready to receive from Jesus?
    <br>Yes, it is.
    <br>Good, wonderful, because we need to make sure our heart is engaged with God.
    <br>If your heart is full of grudges, pain of the past, resentment, bitterness,
    <br>this may be a hindrance to what God wants to do.
    <br>I am here to announce to you - I am an announcer.
    <br>God has sent me to announce to you right now
    <br>that Jesus Christ is on His way to heal you right now from this disease.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Open your heart; it is time for that healing.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That spirit of asthma, spirit of sickness - come out!
    <br>Out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Come out of her!
    <br>Distance Is Not A Barrier
    <br>Interactive Prayer Sessions
    <br>Viewers all over the world, as our sister is being delivered,
    <br>you too are being delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As she is vomiting out that sickness, that poison - be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You are included, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>You spirit behind this asthma - you will speak out right now!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Viewers, you can see our sister under the influence of the Holy Spirit right now,
    <br>as everything not of Jesus is being cast out of her.
    <br>Right now demon, you must speak out!
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I destroyed her."
    <br>Which sickness did you give her?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I gave her asthma."
    <br>So, you are the cause of asthma.
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I am an idol."
    <br>You idol, your time has expired in this lady's body.
    <br>Right now, in the name of Jesus Christ: Get out in Jesus' name!
    <br>Come out of her!
    <br>Right now, viewers all over the world, you can see the deliverance taking place.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier, at home, wherever you are watching right now -
    <br>be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be delivered from that spirit of sickness,
    <br>spirit of affliction, spirit of depression - be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Right now, you wicked spirit, we don't have any more time for you.
    <br>Get out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of her, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, begin to give thanks to God.
    <br>As our sister is free, you are free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Sister, right now rise to your feet; you are declared free from asthma.
    <br>Tell us, sister, how are you feeling now?
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I feel OK!
    <br>Just calm down; speak clearly.
    <br>What just happened to you?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>Now we want you to breathe in; breathe deeply to confirm that God has healed you from that asthma.
    <br>Tell us how you are feeling.
    <br>Healed Of Asthma In Jesus' Name
    <br>As you are breathing now, what is the difference from before?
    <br>I can't feel the pain.
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>And we want to encourage you, now that Jesus Christ has healed you,
    <br>you must make sure you follow Him so that you will maintain this healing.
    <br>Remember, the main thing about Christianity is not the work we do
    <br>but the relationship we maintain and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>Please take care of your relationship with God, and we know the best is yet to come.
    <br>Rise to your feet and begin to say thank You Jesus for your healing and deliverance.
    <br>Healed Of Asthma In Jesus' Name
    <br>Congratulations, sister!
    <br>Viewers, did you see what just happened for the glory of God?
    <br>This one is more tremendous, this one is more marvellous;
    <br>it shows that Jesus is more powerful in distance.
    <br>As the woman received the prayer, she began manifesting; she vomited and now, she is free.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>This is what we told you: Everything that you see happen at The SCOAN is what is happening here.
    <br>Only we did not show it to the public on Emmanuel TV
    <br>out of concern for the multitude of people who would apply, and how to handle it.
    <br>But those who received healing have been testifying to their neighbours
    <br>and their neighbours have started sending in their emails.
    <br>Now, we don't know how to answer them, except to throw this open.
    <br>There is nothing we can do about it any longer.
    <br>What we have been hiding cannot be hidden any longer.
    <br>We are happy to announce to you that the next "Distance Is Not A Barrier Interactive Prayer Sessions"
    <br>will be held live, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Are you not happy about this blessing?
    <br>Do you not see it as a wonderful grace?
    <br>Now, it may not be your turn yet because of so many people in the queue already.
    <br>Ever since we made the announcement weeks ago, people have been sending in their prayer requests
    <br>and we have been attending to them, putting them through on the procedure they need to follow.
    <br>Don't worry!
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>You will see a little of it live on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Now, I know the question running through your heart right now:
    <br>How do I join the "Distance Is Not A Barrier Interactive Prayer Sessions"?
    <br>We want to read to you now the procedures on what you can do to get yourself ready:
    <br>STEP 1: PRAYER REQUEST
    <br>Submit your prayer request on our official Emmanuel TV Website:
    <br>www.emmanuel.tv/contacts/
    <br>Let us know the details of your situation and wait patiently for our reply.
    <br>We will let you know if there is any additional information we need.
    <br>STEP 2: TECHNICAL NOTES
    <br>We thank God for this technology; it is also another aspect of God's gift.
    <br>PHONES:
    <br>For those who are only semi-technical or have phones that can only make phone calls,
    <br>you will need someone to help you or teach you the technical aspect
    <br>so that we can see and hear you and you can see and hear us.
    <br>RECORDING:
    <br>In a situation where the person receiving prayer is carrying the phone with the camera,
    <br>what will we do when they fall under the anointing?
    <br>The camera may fall and the manifestation of God's power will not show on the camera -
    <br>the manifesting, vomiting etc.
    <br>You need people to be on standby with you.
    <br>A relation must be there to help you and hold the camera.
    <br>It is to your advantage, as anything can happen; God does as He wills.
    <br>INTERNET CONNECTION:
    <br>The internet bandwidth in some countries is very low and may not meet the standard requirements.
    <br>We are at your service.
    <br>We will be the ones to call you and provide whatever you need.
    <br>STEP 3: HOME ARRANGEMENT
    <br>Please turn off all amplifiers and close doors and windows so outside noise and light won't interfere.
    <br>Interference can be caused by rain, storms, open windows, amplifiers.
    <br>Those with babies and small children need someone to look after them during the prayer
    <br>so that they won't cry or shout that you are not attending to them at that time.
    <br>STEP 4: DRESS CODE
    <br>We're in the presence of God and what we wear must be for the glory of God.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>That is all you need to get yourself ready for the Distance Is Not a Barrier Interactive Prayer Sessions.
    <br>Many have already submitted their prayer requests and we are attending to them
    <br>and putting them through on the procedures.
    <br>You will see them live on Emmanuel TV during our next Interactive Prayer Sessions.
    <br>We advise you to watch Emmanuel TV so that you will see and hear what we are talking about better.
    <br>We can't wait for you to join us on Distance Is Not a Barrier Interactive Live Prayer Sessions,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>What a God we serve!
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
