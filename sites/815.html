    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Say in the name of Jesus, you demon, OUT!!!!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Command them to come out right now.
    <br>I am his wife.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>I made him useless.
    <br>What have you done to his career?
    <br>He can't do anything, he can't progress - nothing.
    <br>How did you enter him?
    <br>I make love to him.
    <br>Many nights when he is about to meet his success, I make love to him
    <br>and just render him useless.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Children of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Daniel, and the lady standing beside me is my mum.
    <br>I was delivered from a spiritual wife.
    <br>It all started when things got rough
    <br>so we had to relocate back to the village.
    <br>I went to sit for my WAEC exams.
    <br>I was an external student.
    <br>There was this day I was walking out with my friend, going back to school.
    <br>A man - a priest because he wore a white cassock - stopped his car.
    <br>He pointed out to my friend and said, "Come!"
    <br>I was thinking it was my friend so I pushed my friend forward
    <br>and said, "You are the one he is calling".
    <br>My friend stepped forward, and he said, "No, not you - him!"
    <br>So I came and he spoke to me.
    <br>I didn't know him so I just wanted to be nice.
    <br>I greeted him and he asked me what I was doing there
    <br>and I told him I came for an exam.
    <br>He told me that I was good looking
    <br>and he wanted to know me later.
    <br>He was like, could he get my number.
    <br>At first I just wanted to walk away but I stayed back just to be polite.
    <br>I gave him my number and that is how the whole thing started.
    <br>From time to time, he called to check up and there was this day
    <br>that he finally invited me over to his place.
    <br>That is when he made advances at me
    <br>and I was shocked because I know priests represent God.
    <br>Like servants here on earth.
    <br>I was seeing the different side of this person.
    <br>When he made advances at me, I wanted to walk away.
    <br>He pulled me back and said that it was alright, that if I didn't want to,
    <br>it was no problem, he was not in a rush.
    <br>For the benefit of the viewers all over the world, what do you mean
    <br>by 'he made advances at you' - what did that actually mean?
    <br>He tried to kiss me.
    <br>To have an affair with you?
    <br>Yes, he tried to have an affair with me.
    <br>That is, man to man?
    <br>Yes, man to man.
    <br>I saw it as insane, but I couldn't say anything then.
    <br>Have you had such an experience before in your life?
    <br>No. Never.
    <br>I told him that I couldn't do that and
    <br>he told me that it was okay, he was not in a hurry,
    <br>that it takes time and all that.
    <br>I left.
    <br>When I came back home, my friend asked me what had happened, if he gave me something.
    <br>I said, "Nothing, I just went to see him".
    <br>What age were you by that time?
    <br>I was at 20, 22.
    <br>He called again. I was like I was never to go back there again.
    <br>I slept and had a dream.
    <br>There were these people surrounding me - they were many.
    <br>It was like an island.
    <br>I was there, they were dancing, doing all sorts of things.
    <br>I woke up because I was shocked;
    <br>it was the first time I had such a dream.
    <br>I couldn't tell anybody; I just went along with it.
    <br>So it was after this encounter you had with the man that you had this dream?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So what happened after the dream?
    <br>I woke up. I couldn't tell anybody, not even my mum.
    <br>I couldn't call to tell them.
    <br>Despite the fact that we were brought up in the way of the Lord,
    <br>I was like - let it be.
    <br>It is a normal dream.
    <br>The next time he called, I found that I didn't hesitate.
    <br>He asked me to come over and I went to his place.
    <br>He made the same advances at me and I played along.
    <br>But we did not have serious intimacy.
    <br>So as I left, he came to me and said that I would have to come some other time.
    <br>Time and time went and it kept being like that.
    <br>I managed to gain favors from him
    <br>and I went on with the whole thing, and I felt it was 'cool'.
    <br>That is how it was and after I left school -
    <br>I was done with the WAEC exams and left - he kept on calling.
    <br>The distance was already there and we couldn't meet.
    <br>Every time he called and asked me to come over,
    <br>I resisted, saying I had things to do
    <br>because every time I left the house,
    <br>I had to explain where I was going to or what I was going to do.
    <br>So that connection was cut short.
    <br>I then wrote the JAM exams and I passed - I had 241.
    <br>We were actually preparing for other exams when my brother called.
    <br>He said he wanted me to come over to Ghana because he is based there.
    <br>My mother said that I had to go to school first,
    <br>but my dad said, "Let him go, it's better this way".
    <br>He explained to me that whenever I am together with my brother, I can do better.
    <br>So we abandoned the fact that I had to go to school
    <br>and I went to Ghana.
    <br>I stayed with my brother there.
    <br>That is when I met someone who had the 'same thing' as me because this person...
    <br>We want to be carried along.
    <br>So when you travelled to Ghana, you lost contact with this first man
    <br>and you said you met a person with the 'same thing' -
    <br>what is that thing?
    <br>The person whom I met was the owner of the place where we stayed in Ghana.
    <br>At first he was like a friend.
    <br>He does business with my brother.
    <br>You mean he also had the spirit of man?
    <br>Yes, he also had that spirit in him.
    <br>So then, we always talked, he developed this interest in me.
    <br>It went on and when I started having problems
    <br>with my brother because of that spirit and left,
    <br>that is when he opened up to me who he was.
    <br>At that period, I was at his place and he made advances and we went intimate.
    <br>It kept on being like that.
    <br>It happened each time when I was in the midst of getting something,
    <br>when I was walking towards something,
    <br>when I 'went down' with a man, the whole thing crumbled.
    <br>I found myself sleeping with women in the dream.
    <br>I didn't have much in the physical but in my spiritual life,
    <br>I found myself owning cars and stuffs and all that.
    <br>I slept with a lot of women; they used different faces
    <br>of people I know or people I must have seen somewhere.
    <br>And that is how every thing I put my hands on crumbled.
    <br>I couldn't stay because that spirit was always pushing me to move forward.
    <br>So I couldn't stay, because each time I am in a place and they like to turn on...
    <br>Because my brother is the type who is always listening to ministration,
    <br>he is always watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Each time he watched it, I just walked away
    <br>because I didn't want to be there.
    <br>What would make you walk away from watching Emmanuel TV?
    <br>My body became very very hot.
    <br>Why?
    <br>I can't really say because each time I sat down and they prayed, especially the mass prayer,
    <br>it happened every time there was a prayer.
    <br>By that time, what spirit was in you?
    <br>At that period, I had this spirit to sleep with men.
    <br>Because of that spirit of man in you,
    <br>when you saw Emmanuel TV prayer going on,
    <br>you couldn't stay, you always walked away, is that right?
    <br>Yes, I couldn't stay because I felt that my whole body was very very hot.
    <br>So because of this urge in you,
    <br>how did you meet with fellow men that you often went out with,
    <br>and how did you identify when you saw people that had the same spirit
    <br>that you were having - the spirit of man?
    <br>It happened that each time I went out, my relationship with females was lesser,
    <br>my relationship with men was more than with females.
    <br>Each time I met with someone who had that same spirit,
    <br>that spirit of being with a man,
    <br>it's easy because 'the devil does know the devil'.
    <br>Each time I was with someone, friends, men,
    <br>and I saw someone who had the same spirit -
    <br>at first I would sit and admire, that is what I did;
    <br>and if the person admired back,
    <br>it meant that we are game, so I would step out and we would talk.
    <br>We would just have a normal discussion.
    <br>Then we break - the person breaks up and tells me who he is or he likes men.
    <br>and I equally expose myself by telling the person that I equally like men.
    <br>Okay. Did you get any form of payment for going out with men like yourself
    <br>or did you actually get paid, and what were the caliber of men you went out with?
    <br>OK, I went out with high-class boys;
    <br>those were the kind of guys that every normal boy of my age would want.
    <br>You would see them out there and say,
    <br>"Wow! I would like this kind of person".
    <br>I didnt't get paid for it all the time.
    <br>I just got favors from them.
    <br>They would say, "I will do this for you".
    <br>After the whole thing, after we had slept together,
    <br>they would say that they would do this for me.
    <br>I didn't get to ask.
    <br>What happened when you were at school?
    <br>Tell us more about your school life.
    <br>Then I came back to Nigeria, and I had to start all over again.
    <br>I met a friend who was a banker.
    <br>He was the one who actually talked me into going back to school.
    <br>That was when I was looking for a job.
    <br>I met him and he wanted to help me.
    <br>After I got admission, he was helping me out.
    <br>He equally had the same spirit in him.
    <br>He had the spirit of being with a man.
    <br>He was always helping me out
    <br>and things like that happened.
    <br>I found out that each time I got upset, there was nobody that could control me.
    <br>Nobody could talk me out of it or get to calm me down.
    <br>So all along, your parents didn't know you were living this life?
    <br>No, nobody except me. I kept it to myself.
    <br>I just didn't want to tell anybody who I was then.
    <br>So when you went to school, did you get involved into other things,
    <br>apart from meeting with fellow men like yourself?
    <br>Yes, even then, when I got admission, my mum took me to a church where they prayed for me.
    <br>The prophet there prophesied to me that he sees me joining a cult,
    <br>that they will lure me into a cult.
    <br>It didn't just stop there because when I went to school,
    <br>I was always upset and I always wanted more.
    <br>So I went out and I was with a friend -
    <br>in our lodge, you got to find different kinds of people.
    <br>In that place where I stayed, you got to find drug addicts, prostitutes.
    <br>So I was there in a school and I was equally working as of then.
    <br>Working and schooling wasn't easy because I was a regular student.
    <br>I had to do like three weeks at work and one week at school
    <br>so I couldn't concentrate.
    <br>I was with my friend one day, and we were drinking.
    <br>I used to drink and do drugs; I did hard drugs.
    <br>I did codeine, and all that.
    <br>I smoked weed.
    <br>I didn't smoke normal cigarettes as any other person would want to do.
    <br>I got to do hard drugs.
    <br>I did tramadol, I did so many of them.
    <br>Have your parents ever heard of this?
    <br>No, they haven't.
    <br>So your mother is hearing this for the first time?
    <br>My mum is actually hearing this for the first time.
    <br>And it happened that way.
    <br>I was with a friend one day, and he asked me to accompany him somewhere.
    <br>Then we were 'high', 'stoned'.
    <br>We were trying to calm ourselves down.
    <br>We were 'stoned' and he talked to me and I played along.
    <br>I went out with him and I didn't know where he was actually taking me.
    <br>He was always telling me -
    <br>each time he saw me upset and I got to calm down -
    <br>he was always telling me that he saw a great person in me.
    <br>That is when I joined the cult.
    <br>It is a popular cult.
    <br>I joined, and on the day of initiation, I was taken to the ground -
    <br>they call it 'the arena ground'.
    <br>I was taken there.
    <br>We were so many and we had to bow our heads down.
    <br>We didn't see each other, we couldn't see, it was dark.
    <br>The whole place was dark.
    <br>We were taken, we were all beaten for seven good hours;
    <br>we were beaten very hard with logs.
    <br>Some people passed out in the process,
    <br>some died because it was not easy
    <br>for you to stand a 7 hours torture - nobody,
    <br>no matter how strong you are.
    <br>I found out that then, I felt no pain.
    <br>I was there, I took the whole thing for 7 good hours.
    <br>After the whole thing they gave me the name.
    <br>They said it's a strong name that is always there to guide me,
    <br>that the person who had the name before was a strong person.
    <br>So that spirit commanded to do things.
    <br>So what was the name you were given in the cult?
    <br>I was actually called 'Field Marshal Idi Amin Dada'.
    <br>It's a strong name.
    <br>So I never used to answer my own name.
    <br>They said it's the Jew name.
    <br>So I would not be known, we wouldn't get to address ourselves,
    <br>except we were in the public so that we wouldn't expose ourselves.
    <br>So can you tell us some of those activities that you partook in
    <br>when you joined the cult
    <br>and what was your position in the cult?
    <br>The name given to me was a name of someone
    <br>who was actually stronger than I was.
    <br>I was actually being groomed to take the person's position.
    <br>Nobody knows about that.
    <br>So I never used to go to school, I would drink, I would party a lot.
    <br>Every time I woke up and wanted to go to work, I was 'stoned'.
    <br>I was stoned, I had to take my bath so many times.
    <br>When I got to work, nobody would notice, I just acted normal.
    <br>So all this while, your parents thought you were in the school studying?
    <br>All this while, they thought I was in school studying.
    <br>My mum called because I am closer to my mum,
    <br>and I know right now she feels so disappointed in me.
    <br>Evey time she called and asked if I prayed...
    <br>I never used to go to church.
    <br>There was nothing you could tell me about God that I wanted to listen.
    <br>Why would I want to go to church when I had a swell time
    <br>smoking and getting stoned,
    <br>getting to see a lot of girls.
    <br>Where would I get the time to worship and focus on God?
    <br>So it wasn't there.
    <br>A lot of my time was spent in the club and with friends
    <br>who we went out with doing bad things.
    <br>So what happened later?
    <br>At school, at the initiation ground, I was asked to do something,
    <br>we took an oath.
    <br>We were asked how many people we would kill for the cult.
    <br>If you were asked that question, you would just say that you will kill many.
    <br>And with that oath you were expected to do what you promised to them.
    <br>I was given my own pistol. I have a picture of it on my phone.
    <br>I went on with that - no school.
    <br>The painful part is that they were believing I was in school,
    <br>but I wasn't in school.
    <br>I was just working, that is what I told myself
    <br>because from January till today I don't even own a dime to myself
    <br>because I spent everything there.
    <br>The least I know I payed for were my  textbooks.
    <br>And as for my school fees - I used them to purchase a pistol for myself.
    <br>So then the heat was too much because you got to see rivals from other cults.
    <br>So while they were still grooming me, I was playing along.
    <br>At the end of the day, I would be better than the person who had this name before,
    <br>and I would do many things for them,
    <br>so that was the promise I made.
    <br>What actually lured me back to them was that I was a fraudster -
    <br>that is what I used to do.
    <br>Working with them - what actually brought me to my friend,
    <br>was when he told me that if I were with them, I would get more connections.
    <br>And in no time would I get my own car and house - comfortably,
    <br>and I would get to take care of who I want to take care of.
    <br>That is what actually took me in,
    <br>and he saw that spirit to command,
    <br>that ability to do many things for the cult.
    <br>We were always given tools to work,
    <br>I had a camera - a webcam,
    <br>a recorded video of both a male and a female.
    <br>So we wrote to people and browsed on the internet
    <br>and we would tell them different stories.
    <br>If I used a female camera, I made the guy to come after me,
    <br>and he would want to meet me.
    <br>And I would tell him that I am busy - just to give him an excuse.
    <br>So you posed as a female by using a video or pictures of a female?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I owned a female video and several pictures of her.
    <br>I used it to work - each time they told me that they wanted to see me,
    <br>I would pose and give them a video cam - a recorded cam.
    <br>There was a software I used to play the cam.
    <br>When you were looking at me, you wouldn't see me
    <br>that is playing the cam, you would get to watch the recorded cam.
    <br>So what did you get from these people at the end of the day -
    <br>those that you succeeded in deceiving?
    <br>We gave them bills, we dealt with them.
    <br>We knew that it was not possible appearing before the person physically.
    <br>We told the person that we were going to send the person our package,
    <br>our personal belongings to them,
    <br>for them to believe that we were actually coming.
    <br>Each time we told them that, we would send fake stuffs or fake documents to them to make them believe
    <br>and they payed for the belongings.
    <br>You have defrauded a lot of people through this means?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Okay, tell us as a result of the cult activities,
    <br>what did that lead you to? Are you still in school today?
    <br>What was happening to your life before this deliverance?
    <br>Before this deliverance, I couldn't stay at school anymore because
    <br>the rival cult came against the cult that I used to be with
    <br>and I was still being groomed.
    <br>I didn't know much, I only knew the basics,
    <br>I only knew little things
    <br>but I was groomed for something, that's all I knew.
    <br>But I owned a pistol.
    <br>So you dropped out of school at the end of the day?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So what was life like before you came for this deliverance?
    <br>I dropped out of school because I didn't pay the school fees.
    <br>I used my fees to purchase an arm for myself.
    <br>When you came to The SCOAN, tell us what happened.
    <br>I had to leave school, I lost the job that I was doing.
    <br>I came back to Lagos because I talked to a director of mine and he told me that
    <br>he was going to get me a job here in Lagos.
    <br>I came to Lagos with a mind of getting a job.
    <br>I didn't tell anybody what had happened,
    <br>the least I told them is that there was a hit and I was beaten badly
    <br>and I had to leave school.
    <br>I came back to Lagos thinking I was going to get a job.
    <br>My friend who talked me into coming here told me that I should come to church,
    <br>believing God that I would get something after I confessed.
    <br>And last Sunday during the mass prayer, what happened to you?
    <br>At the mass prayer when they started praying, I couldn't control myself.
    <br>I noticed that my entire body was so hot.
    <br>Even the building was too hot.
    <br>The man sitting beside me was equally hot,
    <br>so I told him that he should excuse me I wanted to pee.
    <br>He said, "You cannot go anywhere, that is how it starts,
    <br>and you get to miss your deliverance".
    <br>I was there and I got so upset. I just wanted to unleash it on him.
    <br>So I sat down quietly and the next thing I heard a voice saying,
    <br>"Just keep calm, it's just a normal thing and nothing is going to happen".
    <br>During the ministration of the Morning Water I was sitting at the back.
    <br>It wasn't even my turn, the Morning Water was being ministered to someone else.
    <br>I was feeling too hot.
    <br>I wasn't feeling comfortable in my own clothes.
    <br>When the evangelist stepped forward to me,
    <br>I just lost it, I couldn't remember anything.
    <br>The only thing I noticed was that I woke up and I saw myself on the floor.
    <br>Quite embarrassing but I stood there because I was helpless and
    <br>I knew all this while something was wrong with me
    <br>because there was nothing I ever did that worked out.
    <br>Each time someone wanted to help me I ended up
    <br>making love with a strange lady in my dream and I would lose all of it.
    <br>I got angry so easily and no one could control me.
    <br>I had known that there was something wrong with me
    <br>and I had always wanted to get out.
    <br>And since after your deliverance can you tell us -
    <br>what is your condition now, what are the signs of a delivered person?
    <br>Before my deliverance, my Christian life was zero.
    <br>There was nothing to write home about concerning my Christian life.
    <br>I didn't go to church, I didn't read the Bible.
    <br>Now, I own a Bible - it's quite shocking.
    <br>I could not pray. If you asked me to pray, I would just murmur and that was the end.
    <br>But now I can pray, I get to read my Bible more - I read it daily.
    <br>It's a different thing.
    <br>Do you still have the urge to meet men like yourself?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>I don't really have such urge.
    <br>I am free because I feel so light.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, Mama, we welcome you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you introduce yourself?
    <br>Your son has said so much about his past life,
    <br>We just want to confirm what you knew about your son in the past
    <br>and tell us what has been happening in his life before today,
    <br>now you are giving this testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Cassandra.
    <br>The young man standing next to me is my son.
    <br>Actually, like he said, I brought them up in a Christian way.
    <br>In a God fearing manner.
    <br>I am so surprised and shocked today
    <br>about all he has been saying.
    <br>All this confession he is making, you are hearing it for the very first time now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Like he said, whenever he was out of the house,
    <br>I would make sure to ask him if he prays.
    <br>Even when he went to Ghana, while he was in Accra, Ghana,
    <br>I told him that Emmanuel TV is there in Accra, Ghana,
    <br>that he should try and locate where The SCOAN was
    <br>so that he could always go there for the service.
    <br>But to no avail.
    <br>So your son was truly a bad boy in the past?
    <br>Yes, I would say that because we were formerly in Lagos here,
    <br>but when we relocated to Anambra state,
    <br>my husband bought the decoder.
    <br>And whenever we were watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>he didn't like watching with us.
    <br>As soon as everybody went to sleep,
    <br>that is when he came to the parlor.
    <br>Or sometimes he stayed watching with us and he was sleeping.
    <br>I cautioned him many times.
    <br>As soon as everybody went to sleep,
    <br>he would tune over to those vampire films.
    <br>Sometimes when he was just playing with his siblings in the house,
    <br>he would scare them with words and animal kind of looks.
    <br>Each time when the siblings were complaining, I would complain too.
    <br>And when he went to Ghana, he did the same thing - he was not going to church.
    <br>When he finally came back here, he got admission to go back to school.
    <br>He got admission in Imo state.
    <br>While he was schooling, he was working as well.
    <br>Every time I asked him, maybe he would call to say one thing or the other -
    <br>I would ask him, if he payed his tithe.
    <br>I would tell him, "You have to tithe, if you tithe that is what you will use to hold on to God".
    <br>Because of time, can you tell us -
    <br>ever since your son has been delivered, what are the attitudes you noticed
    <br>in him since his deliverance?
    <br>After his deliverance last Sunday,
    <br>he even bought himself a Bible, he reads his Bible, he prays.
    <br>By Gods grace, he is a changed person.
    <br>And how does that make you feel as a mother?
    <br>I am happy as a mother.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you. What word of advice do you have for youth like you?
    <br>Many are into the same addiction and cult activities
    <br>that you have been delivered from.
    <br>Just in a word, what advice do you have for them?
    <br>Before I give my word of advice unto the world,
    <br>I would want to use this opportunity
    <br>to plead on everybody to help me to beg my mum.
    <br>I know I have brought so much pain.
    <br>I know she is finding it difficult to believe that this is the person
    <br>she has always believed in.
    <br>I'm so sorry, mum!
    <br>Daniel & Mother - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>It's okay, I forgive you.
    <br>Mama, we just want to let you know,
    <br>on behalf of the anointed man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the Bible says, if you fail to realize that demons are the ones
    <br>that cause people to be bowed down in bondage, you are fighting the wrong battle.
    <br>So all that he did in the past, he has disappointed you,
    <br>he has walked in the wrong way and lived a bad life in the past
    <br>is all as a result of this evil spirit that has tormented him,
    <br>even though he has played a role in finding himself in that.
    <br>Anyone can be a victim.
    <br>Thank God you are here today to stand side by side with your son
    <br>to testify that he is a changed person now.
    <br>So the past is over.
    <br>Your son is no longer the person he used to be,
    <br>now he is a new person in Christ Jesus.
    <br>The Bible says, "We forgive because we need to be forgiven"
    <br>and we thank God that you have forgiven your son, is that right?
    <br>Yes, I have.
    <br>So how do you show that you have forgiven your son?
    <br>Hallelujah, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>So we thank God for everything.
    <br>Brother, your mum has forgiven you as a Christian
    <br>and now you know that you have a role to play
    <br>to prove yourself as good child again.
    <br>And that you can only do by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Get closer to Jesus and allow His Word to influence you.
    <br>And by so doing, your life is totally reformed and
    <br>your future in Christ Jesus is guaranteed.
    <br>And just one word of advice for people before you leave.
    <br>My word of advice to young people like me,
    <br>who have been brought up in a Christian home
    <br>and you have a mum that is close to you.
    <br>Try to talk to her.
    <br>If you find any difficulties in anything - your studies, your personal life -
    <br>it's best you open up to your parents
    <br>because they are the gods we have here on earth.
    <br>They are more like guardians to us,
    <br>they are like servants of God given to us children.
    <br>My advice to young people out there is
    <br>whatever you see out there -
    <br>like if I were out there living my life like the way I used to live
    <br>and you would want to be like me -
    <br>stop admiring people for who they are
    <br>and pray to be what God wants you to be.
    <br>Thank you. Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Thank you very much. That says it all.
    <br>Stop admiring people on the outside
    <br>for who they are, or what they are,
    <br>but just try to be what God wants you to be.
    <br>We congratulate you for this deliverance
    <br>and we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace
    <br>to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and we believe that you are coming back to give a greater testimony
    <br>of what God Almighty will begin to do in your life,
    <br>your future and career through this deliverance, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
