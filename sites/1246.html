  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for my joy.
    <br>This is joy - joy everlasting.
    <br>This shows today is the day of joy for your life.
    <br>Today is the day of joy for my life.
    <br>Today my enemy has made a big mistake.
    <br>Today is the day of my salvation,
    <br>the day of my breakthrough because Jesus is alive.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Welcome to the arena of liberty.
    <br>Welcome to the presence of the living Jesus.
    <br>No matter what you have been facing up to now,
    <br>no matter the trouble you have been having so far,
    <br>today you will know that Jesus is aware.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, Jesus is aware of my situation".
    <br>Whatever has been happening to me so far, He is in control.
    <br>It is for my advancement.
    <br>It is for my breakthrough.
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus for that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Have your seat in His presence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are serving a faithful and true God.
    <br>Whatever people must have said about you,
    <br>whatever your situation must have told you,
    <br>today you will know the truth about yourself.
    <br>I am here, ready for the battle.
    <br>I am ready for the battle.
    <br>I am ready for victory.
    <br>Brethren, the reason why so many people in the Church today are weak
    <br>is because they are not armed for battle.
    <br>The first step to be strong is to realise that life is a battleground.
    <br>That is why you have been experiencing all these things because life is a battleground.
    <br>There is no neutral ground.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is no neutral ground".
    <br>There is no hideout.
    <br>The purpose of God in your life cannot be fulfilled without the heat of trials.
    <br>It can be sickness, affliction, joblessness - just name it.
    <br>The purpose of God in your life can never be fulfilled without a battle.
    <br>Prepare yourself for battle.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, prepare yourself for battle -
    <br>for your business, home and destiny.
    <br>Prepare yourself for battle".
    <br>Life is not perfect.
    <br>We are living in a world where the enemy will never allow
    <br>God's purpose in our lives to be fulfilled without putting up a battle.
    <br>You need to put up a battle.
    <br>That is why you are here and the battle is the Lord's.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Be ready for the battle.
    <br>Be ready for victory.
    <br>This brings us to the title of our message today: THE BELIEVER'S CONFLICT.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Believer's Conflict".
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Joshua 24; I start my reading from verse 14.
    <br>"Now therefore, fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth,
    <br>and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt.
    <br>Serve the Lord."
    <br>Verse 15.
    <br>"And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord,
    <br>choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve,
    <br>whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River,
    <br>or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.
    <br>But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
    <br>Verse 18.
    <br>"And the Lord drove out from before us all the people,
    <br>including the Amorites who dwelt in the land.
    <br>We also will serve the Lord, for He is our God."
    <br>Last verse.
    <br>"But Joshua said to the people, 'You cannot serve the Lord, for He is a holy God.
    <br>He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins'."
    <br>Let someone say, "The Believer's Conflict".
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says that we cannot separate warfare from salvation
    <br>because true salvation puts us into direct conflict with satan.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The moment we make a true conversion to Jesus,
    <br>satan hates us the same way he hates Jesus.
    <br>When we are truly saved, we are engaged in a phenomenal battle.
    <br>The moment you took a heart decision to commit your life to Jesus,
    <br>total commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against the devil.
    <br>By identifying yourself to Jesus Christ of Nazareth, you have made satan your bitter enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This world is not my home; I am just passing through.
    <br>Once Jesus Christ purchases us, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that we become aliens, strangers
    <br>and there is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.
    <br>Once Jesus purchases us with His blood, we become aliens, strangers, foreigners
    <br>and there is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>You will not go where Jesus is not welcome.
    <br>You will not say what Jesus would not want you to say.
    <br>You will not do what Jesus would not want you to do.
    <br>You will only go where Jesus wants you to go.
    <br>The battle is the Lord’s.
    <br>Take your position.
    <br>Victory is certain.
    <br>We are spirit beings living in a physical body,
    <br>learning to live in a natural world dominated by satan.
    <br>He rules by sin, he fights in sin and sin is his weapon.
    <br>But glory be to God, in the name of Jesus, we have the victory!
    <br>But glory be to God, in the name of Jesus, I have the victory!
    <br>The best antidote to the poison of satan is to walk in the Spirit.
    <br>Walk in the Spirit.
    <br>Pray in the Spirit.
    <br>Move in the Spirit.
    <br>To walk in the Spirit, the key is not to suppress the flesh but to surrender to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The instruction for such walk is entirely guided and regulated by the Spirit of Jesus.
    <br>How?
    <br>The Bible says we listen to the testimony of our conscience
    <br>because our heart is controlled by the Holy Spirit
    <br>In each step, each direction, each choice you make,
    <br>intimation and suggestion comes from the Holy Spirit -
    <br>the Commander, the Controller, the Instructor for such action be performed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say to your neighbour, "Prepare your heart.
    <br>Keep your heart".
    <br>That victory is there already for those who recognise it.
    <br>Let a smile light up your face.
    <br>That victory is already there.
    <br>That victory is already here for those who recognise it.
    <br>Our heart is a communication point, contact point, landing point for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But today, because of many fleshly desires,
    <br>many hearts today have become a conflict room between flesh and spirit,
    <br>conflict between hate and love,
    <br>conflict between faith and doubt.
    <br>That is why the Bible says that our values need to be tested against facts and experiences.
    <br>A man may profess, “I’m a Christian”, but not such in heart.
    <br>A man may come out and say, “I’m a born again”, but not such in heart.
    <br>We know we are totally committed to Jesus Christ when that commitment is tested.
    <br>Jesus needs to test our commitment and the genuineness of our faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we turn our Bible to the Book of Matthew 19:16-22,
    <br>we have a case of a rich, young ruler
    <br>who came to Jesus to express his zeal, his commitment to the Kingdom of God
    <br>and said to Jesus, “Lord, what can I do to inherit eternal life?”
    <br>Jesus answered by sending a declaration, a probing declaration to check the state of his heart
    <br>and said to the man, “Well done. But if you want to be perfect, there is something you need to do.
    <br>Go, take your possessions, sell them, give them to the poor, come and follow Me -
    <br>rewards for you in Heaven”.
    <br>There was a conflict in the heart of the man.
    <br>But the Bible says, he went back sorrowful because he had great possessions.
    <br>What can we say about that?
    <br>If our actions are motivated by self-interest, we are mortgaging tomorrow’s joy.
    <br>Doing something as a matter of commitment to God does not involve any condition attached.
    <br>If you make God one of those things, then your commitment to God will be partial, not total.
    <br>When your loyalty towards God enters into conflict with money, position, relationship, comfort,
    <br>you are likely to sit on the fence and become indifferent,
    <br>especifically when holding onto your faith is painful.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Such was the case of the people of Israel when they entered the promised land.
    <br>They said to Joshua, “We shall serve the Lord, our God”
    <br>and Joshua said to them, “You shall not be able to serve the Lord”.
    <br>Why did he say that? It wasn’t harsh.
    <br>The Bible says, he saw that there was a conflict in their heart between flesh and spirit.
    <br>There was a conflict as to know whether to give to God a total commitment or not.
    <br>As a leader in righteousness who conquered all the enemies,
    <br>Joshua knew that our responsibility to God is a commitment and fellowship rather than sacrifice.
    <br>Therefore, he urged them to give a total commitment to God - the only Source of salvation.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, no matter what comes, no matter what happens, total commitment to Jesus -
    <br>the only Source of salvation - my Deliverer, my Protector - He is faithful.
    <br>Faith in Him is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>I want you to turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour, will you be ready to serve the Lord?
    <br>Are you ready?"
    <br>Today, many show great zeal out of mere conviction but lack fundamental roots in God.
    <br>Faith is our root in God.
    <br>It takes the grace of God Almighty to maintain your confession of faith
    <br>for when the heat, the vicissitudes, trials of this world come with their choking hands,
    <br>that unstable zeal is choked.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty, as a believer, victory is yours today.
    <br>Victory is mine today.
    <br>The Holy Spirit uses my heart to guide my soul before I become what I confess.
    <br>I want you to stand up for a while.
    <br>You have to make a declaration. Are you ready for that?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not alone.
    <br>You are here today. Jesus knows the reason you are here today.
    <br>Jesus knows your past – nothing hidden.
    <br>He knows your present, the state of your mind.
    <br>He knows your future - nothing is hidden from Him.
    <br>A resolve to do whatever proper thing it takes separates the weak from the strong.
    <br>Joshua was a conqueror because his heart was for God.
    <br>He was determined.
    <br>Are you ready for the heart decision?
    <br>Are you ready to fight for your destiny?
    <br>Are you ready to fight for your career?
    <br>Are you ready to stand against that devil tormenting your life?
    <br>You have to know that he is a defeated foe; he knows it and you know it.
    <br>Say, “I will follow Jesus”.
    <br>Say, “I will serve Jesus”.
    <br>Say, “I will love Jesus”.
    <br>Say, “I and my family, we shall serve the Lord.
    <br>This is my declaration; this is my commitment – total, not partial.
    <br>Total – I will serve the Lord.
    <br>I stand on this commitment, no matter what happens, no matter what comes.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is not a hobby.
    <br>There is no alternative to faith – no substitute, no shortcut to faith.
    <br>Faith is the means of victory.
    <br>You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a total commitment to Jesus.
    <br>Total commitment is what Jesus requires through the Gospel because we serve God with our heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Partial commitment cannot defeat satan in battle.
    <br>That is why the Scripture says to you and I, “Watch and pray without ceasing”.
    <br>How do we watch and pray?
    <br>To watch and pray is to discipline your heart before you pray.
    <br>How do we discipline our heart?
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, says to you and I
    <br>that when the Word of God dominates your mouth, it will dominate your heart.
    <br>When the Word dominates your heart, it will influence your behaviour, your conduct.
    <br>You will fear no more.
    <br>Controlling your mediation when you read the Bible,
    <br>that enables you to control your attitude, your utterances.
    <br>Say, “God’s Word refreshes my mind. God’s Spirit renews my strength”.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, this is the final battle.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is the final battle".
    <br>Today, I have taken the decision to fear no more, to worry no more.
    <br>I know that all that has been happening to me was for a purpose.
    <br>Today, I am in the land of liberty.
    <br>Today, I believe Jesus Christ is alive.
    <br>I am here to declare the faithfulness of Christ in my life.
    <br>Victory, salvation is mine.
    <br>When you give a total commitment to Jesus,
    <br>Jesus will take up all the devil’s challenges against your life.
    <br>Today, I say to you: Congratulations!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, congratulations!"
    <br>Shake your hands and say, "Congratulations! Thank you for not giving up!
    <br>Hold on to your faith.
    <br>Keep to your faith because any moment from now, you will see Jesus Christ at work in our midst".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Christianity is not a religion;
    <br>it is a relationship with the God of mercy, the God of compassion, the God of love".
    <br>So whoever you are here today, look to Him.
    <br>Engage your heart and give thanks to Him for His victory
    <br>because what you are about to receive is by pure grace.
    <br>He has won the battle for you and me.
    <br>He has made you worthy.
    <br>The devil has been lying to you so many times but today you know,
    <br>"I will declare God’s faithfulness".
    <br>May God bless His Word, in Jesus’ name.
