  <p>    
    <br>Let us open the pages of our Bible to the Book of John 4:24. Are you there?
    <br>"God is Spirit, and His worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth."
    <br>That means, when you talk of Spirit, you talk of truth.
    <br>So, it means whatever you are doing, if it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth.
    <br>And so, it is all nothing.
    <br>In Spirit and in truth - can you see the relationship.
    <br>If it is not in Spirit, whatever you are doing, saying, teaching,
    <br>and your counselling, if it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth
    <br>and so it is all nothing because God is Spirit.
    <br>If your words in preaching, teaching, counselling are not of the Spirit, they are not of the truth.
    <br>If they are not of the Spirit, they will be idle, meaningless, oftentimes destructive.
    <br>God is Spirit.
    <br>Let us go to the Book of John 14:26.
    <br>"But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name,
    <br>will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you."
    <br>Not some.
    <br>How to sit, how to stand, how to look, how to smile, how to greet in the name of Jesus,
    <br>to teach you how to look in the name of Jesus, sit in the name of Jesus,
    <br>stand in the name of Jesus, to teach you.
    <br>He said, "I have said to you, 'Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you'".
    <br>The Spirit the Father is talking about is the Holy Spirit; that is, the Spirit of God.
    <br>The Word of God is a spirit, creates material things.
    <br>This shows that the Spirit is greater than material.
    <br>What are the materials? Those things you are worshipping today -
    <br>money, properties, this, just look around.
    <br>Every material, including you. You are the greatest.
    <br>The greatest material.
    <br>If the Word of God is a Spirit, creates material things,
    <br>why should we worship material then?
    <br>Why should you believe you can use your material to woo or appeal to God?
    <br>Why should you believe that you can bribe God with your material?
    <br>Why should you believe that by building a cathedral for God, you are a child of God.
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>We are talking about the Word and the Spirit joined.
    <br>This is where this comes in.
    <br>How can the Word join the Spirit?
    <br>If the Spirit does not give the Word, you are speaking to yourself.
    <br>If you say, "Be healed" without Spirit suggestion, you are talking to yourself.
    <br>Your confession cannot give you possession, without the Spirit giving that Word.
    <br>Here, the Faith Bracelet.
    <br>The more you think about what you read here, the more familiar you will become with His voice.
    <br>This will help you to think about the Word.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You;
    <br>more of Your faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control.
    <br>Oh Lord, give me more of You; take more of me.
    <br>Because you are more of yourself that is why you behave funny.
    <br>You are more of yourself.
    <br>We become fools because we are more of ourselves.
    <br>We become liars because we are more of ourselves.
    <br>We are more of ourselves, that is why you can go where we want to go, do what you want to do.
    <br>You are more of yourself.
    <br>Take more of me and give more of You, oh Lord.
    <br>The more you think about what you read, the more familiar you will become with His voice.
    <br>The more you think about what you read,
    <br>the more your spirit acts upon the Word and the Word becomes part of you.
    <br>You are more of today's language than the Word of the Bible.
    <br>The more you think about what you read,
    <br>the more your spirit acts upon the Word you think about
    <br>and the more you become part of the Word you are thinking about.
    <br>You know your challenges. What are your challenges?
    <br>The challenge everyone here has, is that you have not been relating with God.
    <br>You don't know whether God hears you or you hear God.
    <br>You just pray and circumstances stop you many times, not God.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand!
    <br>How many of you hear from God? Pray?
    <br>You hear "fast" - you drop everything; even when you are eating, you hear "fast", you just drop the food.
    <br>And you go into fasting. How many of you?
    <br>It is circumstances that lead you to fast nowadays.
    <br>Situations lead you to fast. If you don't have situations - fast for what when money is in the pocket?
    <br>You fast when there is no money in the pocket.
    <br>Fast when food is on the table?
    <br>You fast when food is not on the table.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Purpose - to get you back to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Purpose - to get me back to God".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Purpose - to get me back to God.]
    <br>On the outside, you have so much. The real battle is in our heart.
    <br>The Word and the Spirit.
    <br>Once again, if the way you speak in preaching, in teaching, in prayer and counselling
    <br>are not according to the truth of God's Word, I mean are not according to God's Spirit,
    <br>they will be idle, meaningless, oftentimes destructive because God is Spirit.
    <br>If it is not in Spirit, whatever you do, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>And to get you back to that Spirit of God - this.
    <br>Your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>How can your spirit act upon the Word?
    <br>Your spirit acts upon the Word when you begin to think about what you read
    <br>and you will soon become part of the Word, part of the Spirit.
    <br>The purpose of this (faith bracelet) - to get you back to God because God is Spirit.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>When we say, "Take more of me; give me more of You",
    <br>we are talking of God's nature: faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, humility, obedience.
    <br>These are God's nature. These are the things that make up God.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You, more of Your faithfulness
    <br>because you are more of unfaithfulness than faithfulness,
    <br>because you are more of disobedience than obedience.
    <br>More of Your kindness, more of Your goodness.
    <br>These are the things that we are talking about.
    <br>You may choose to itemise them one by one.
    <br>Give me more of Your faithfulness, more of Your kindness,
    <br>more of Your goodness, self-control.
    <br>These are the nature of God.
    <br>The more you think about God, God's faithfulness and trustworthiness,
    <br>faith simultaneously comes; faith simultaneously grows.
    <br>That is side by side.
    <br>We as Christians often carry the Bible all the time;
    <br>everywhere you go, you carry the Bible, you read the Bible.
    <br>You want to finish the Bible every week.
    <br>Yet, no faith. Yet, you are still a criminal.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Teaching On 'Faith Bracelet'!!!
    <br>You want to finish it every week so that you can tell your colleague, anywhere,
    <br>"I finish the Bible three times in a year".
    <br>How will you finish the Bible three or four times in a year
    <br>when God says we must read slowly, repeatedly and attentively?
    <br>As you read it, it reads you.
    <br>It is a book that reads you as you read it.
    <br>It means, if you read Him, you must wait for Him to read you.
    <br>You must wait for Him to sow what you read in you.
    <br>You must understand what you read in God's language, not today's language.
    <br>You have the language; you are well educated, you can be an author.
    <br>That does not mean you have been carried along to read it.
    <br>You must be carried along by the Holly Spirit.
    <br>It is a book you must read along with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Spirit of the Father will be released to the degree you obey His Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Spirit of God will be released to the degree, you will honour His Word".
    <br>I mean, you will obey what you read.
    <br>To the extent you obey what you read, to that extent the Spirit is released.
    <br>If you are calling the Heavenly Father, you need the Spirit of Father to get there.
    <br>The more we think about the Word we read, the more our spirits act,
    <br>and the more we become part of the Word.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The word "thinking" - underline it.
    <br>Let them sing the song to you; you will understand what I am talking about.
    <br>I'm thinking when my Lord shall come
    <br>I'm thinking when my Lord 
    <br>Shall come again
    <br>I wonder how that day shall be
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>This is where this comes in.
    <br>You need something on the outside to have proper thinking.
    <br>You need something on the outside because there is so much distraction.
    <br>You see so much that is opposite to the Word of God.
    <br>You need something on the outside that will help you to contact your spirit.
    <br>Try this, please.
    <br>It will get you back to God because you have not been worshipping God in Spirit.
    <br>You do not know God's idea about yourself and about others.
    <br>The Spirit makes us to know that believing is possession.
    <br>Whatever you give without love cannot prosper the person you give.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Whatever you give without love cannot prosper the person you give".
    <br>Those whom God led here today - their blessings will bless me.
    <br>This is why we must act with God to know God's opinion.
    <br>This is why we have this.
    <br>Act with God, know God's opinion about yourself and about others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Act with God, know God's opinion about yourself and others".
    <br>If the Word dominates your mouth, it will pay off one day.
    <br>That is, the Spirit will bring it to pass.
    <br>But when it is here and not here, it is not in line.
    <br>Your confession gives possession when it comes from your heart.
    <br>Once again: Confession gives possession when it comes from the heart.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>Confession cannot give possession when it comes from the mouth.
    <br>Confession gives possession when it comes from the heart.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus Christ" - when it comes from your heart, it happens.
    <br>but when it does not come from your heart, you are speaking to yourself and people around you.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>That is why everything - heart.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>That is the difference between religion and Christianity.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>When you count with your hand, you speak with your heart
    <br>because Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart; only faith pleases God.
    <br>When you are moving it, they will see you moving it but your heart is counting.
    <br>Take this as your best friend; it will get you back to God.
    <br>Work towards that - it is a relationship.
    <br>You have to build this relationship.
    <br>Don't let your wealth deceive you.
    <br>You have money, you believe you are blessed, you are a child of God.
    <br>Spirit is greater than material things.
    <br>Spirit creates material things.
    <br>Don't worship material, worship God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Spirit creates material things.
    <br>This shows that Spirit is greater than material".
    <br>Stop worshipping material, stop worshipping money. Worship God!
    <br>You give all your time for money. How can you measure your Christian life by materials you possess
    <br>when the Spirit of God creates material?
    <br>Take note: God is Spirit; truth and Spirit cannot be separated.
    <br>Truth is Spirit; Spirit is truth. Spirit of God is truth and truth is Spirit of God.
    <br>Brother, come and tell me what the importance of this is.
    <br>The way you are coming is like you are not ready to answer the question.
    <br>I am not ready to drag any issue with you.
    <br>What is the importance of it?
    <br>Speaking in my heart.
    <br>The mind is here.
    <br>Go and sit down, sir. You're speaking in your mind. Don't worry.
    <br>Somebody who wants to answer the question, not someone who wants to drag this from me.
    <br>What is the importance of this to you?
    <br>It is to be meditating towards the Spirit of God.
    <br>Thank you. Meditation.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>A visit to God - meditation.
    <br>It will help you on the outside.
    <br>The more you think - so many times when you are alone, you begin to think about your life.
    <br>There is nothing to think about.
    <br>All those things you are thinking about are material things.
    <br>When you are disappointed, think about God.
    <br>When everything seems to be bad, think about God.
    <br>When there is food on the table, think about God.
    <br>When there is no food on the table, think about God.
    <br>When there is money in your pocket, think about God.
    <br>When there is no money in your pocket, think about God. This will help you.
    <br>Leave it for God; don't worry yourself - that is the meaning of 'think about God'.
    <br>Thank you, brother.
    <br>I know you will surely get your own, but this one is my own.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Teaching On 'FAITH BRACELET'!!!
    <br>This is my own.
    <br>Brother, you are looking at the bracelet instead of talking.
    <br>It will help me not to concentrate so much on the material things.
    <br>- What are the material things? 
    <br>- My business, my problems.
    <br>Everything.
    <br>Everything, including sickness, including the one that says you must bring money home.
    <br>The Bible says that when Jesus met Peter at the sea side, Peter was just sitting down.
    <br>He was thinking because somebody was saying he must bring money home.
    <br>If he did not bring money, he should die inside the water. 
    <br>He was thinking, "I will not leave from here today".
    <br>Thank you. Rise up.
    <br>Create in me a new heart.
    <br>Create in me a clean heart oh Lord
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Create in me a clean heart oh Lord
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Cast me not away
    <br>From Thy presence oh Lord
    <br>Take not Your Holy Spirit from me
    <br>Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Cast me not away
    <br>From Thy presence oh Lord
    <br>Take not Your Holy Spirit from me
    <br>Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Create in me a clean heart oh Lord
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Create in me a clean heart oh Lord
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Cast me not away
    <br>From Thy presence oh Lord
    <br>Take not Your Holy Spirit from me
    <br>Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Cast me not away
    <br>From Thy presence oh Lord
    <br>Take not Your Holy Spirit from me
    <br>Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation
    <br>And renew a right spirit within me
    <br>Remain silent and ask God to take more of me and give me more of You.
    <br>We are more of ourselves; more of yourself cannot give you direction.
    <br>Ask Him - more of You, oh Lord.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
