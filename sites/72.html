  <p>    
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Don't be ruled by your situation.
    <br>A man may be sick in body and yet by a friend of Jesus.
    <br>Be determined.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Be determined.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Every day, stay true to your purpose.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Every day, stay true to your purpose despite snow, rain.
    <br>You know what snow means.
    <br>You know what happens during snow - it is a situation that is affecting one.
    <br>Despite snow or rain, every day, stay true to your purpose.
    <br>In the midst of hardship, name calling, condemnation, soldier on!
    <br>Move on if you are called by the Most High.
    <br>Ask David and he will tell you, ask Daniel and he will tell you,
    <br>ask Meshack, Shedrach and Abednego and they will tell you.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Be determined as a Christian.
    <br>In the midst of hardship, condemnation, intimidation, name calling,
    <br>campaign of calumny, just name them, solider on!
    <br>Move on if you are called by the Most High.
    <br>Ask David and he will tell you, ask Daniel and he will tell you,
    <br>ask Meshack, Shedrach and Abednego and they will tell you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Soldier on!
    <br>Many believe that once they become a believer, Christian, pastor, bishop, they are free of situations.
    <br>As far as you are living, keep pressing, there will be challenges
    <br>unless you stop pressing on.
    <br>You know "pressing on"?
    <br>You don't want to stay in a position; you want to move up, move on.
    <br>As far as you move on, there will be challenges.
    <br>Those challenges are the situations we are talking about.
    <br>It can only test you, cannot destroy you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>My challenges can only test me, cannot destroy me.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>My challenges can only test me, cannot destroy me.
    <br>My challenges will prepare me for extraordinary service.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>We Christians don't fail tests, we pass it - it is a means to promotion.
    <br>No test, no promotion.
    <br>We don't dodge test - you cannot dodge test.
    <br>Those who dodge test are postponing an evil day.
    <br>Those tests you were supposed to have passed and move on.
    <br>You will have somebody to help you - you dodge it...
    <br>You are just pushing the whole thing forward.
    <br>And this is the right time to face the test, pass it and move on.
    <br>So, what are your challenges?
    <br>They are meant to prepare you for extraordinary services.
    <br>Extraordinary means that when you have challenges, you pray the more, you fast the more.
    <br>Your relationship with God... - because you know He is the only One that can help you.
    <br>You move closer and closer.
    <br>It is an opportunity to honour God before men.
    <br>Not: "I have this problem. They prayed for me - no answer."
    <br>You go to a witch doctor, "I'm tired. What is all this?"
    <br>You run to spiritualists.
    <br>After they have done a lot of operations, that is when they run to God.
    <br>They have opened the stomach many times, they now come to God.
    <br>Or maybe when the doctor said, "Go and prepare your will", that is when they run to God.
    <br>Your challenge is an opportunity to honour God before men.
    <br>You know how to honour God.
    <br>"Yes, my Lord can do it. He can."
    <br>You smile, it is time to smile.
    <br>People will now say, "Sorry, what has happened to you?"
    <br>"I have cancer, pain."
    <br>You leave the place, you move along; you are enjoying human sympathy.
    <br>We enjoy human sympathy.
    <br>Human sympathy cannot solve our problem.
    <br>Human sympathy: "Sorry. Yes, sir".
    <br>You leave the place, you go to another section, "Sorry. What happened? This leg. Sorry."
    <br>Another one, "Sorry" - that is human sympathy.
    <br>That exposes your mystery.
    <br>Behind every man God created, there are mysteries.
    <br>Mystery means, "When I get to the man, I don't know what will happen; he may disappear.
    <br>Machine gun cannot enter him. No. No poison can enter him."
    <br>That is mystery.
    <br>Because they don't want to open to people.
    <br>But you, people know you, they know what you can or cannot do.
    <br>"He will eat that food. He will finish it. He will come" - and immediately you appear.
    <br>They say, "I told you he would come".
    <br>They might have bet - suddenly he did not come.
    <br>"You can't predict the man" - that is mystery.
    <br>Keep your mystery - it is a grace to protect you.
    <br>When they don't understand you, all their plan and to set you up will fail.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>If you are born-again, there must be a mystery surrounding you.
    <br>What men know, they destroy; what they don’t know, they begin to call you names.
    <br>When they know you, they destroy you;
    <br>when they don’t know you, they begin to call you names.
    <br>And that is mystery.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>What men know, they destroy; what they don’t know, they call names.
    <br>"He is a wicked man. He is a foolish man. He is a witch-man, this that." - because they don't know you.
    <br>And God will never allow them to know,
    <br>because God knows that the day they know you, they put an end to your career.
    <br>That is what I mean by mystery.
    <br>People know you; that is what led you to what you are facing today.
    <br>They know they can use a mere contract to draw you close.
    <br>They know they can use money to draw you.
    <br>They know how they can get you around them.
    <br>They know you very well. Your people know you.
    <br>That is why sometimes, when I see many of you -
    <br>you have series of cars you are using, "On Thursday we will use Jeep, red car, yellow car".
    <br>If that mystery within you is so great, you can leave your vehicle and join the public car.
    <br>They will just see you entering the bus and sitting down.
    <br>Man without mystery will always be controlled by possessions.
    <br>When you are rich, you live among rich people.
    <br>You will never look back again to where you are coming from.
    <br>Anyone that forgets where he is coming from is finished.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>Since the beginning of my ministry - where I came from, the beginning...
    <br>I'm still...
    <br>The food I'm eating...
    <br>When I was in secondary school, I still enjoy eating that food.
    <br>The mystery around me does not allow me to abandon those things, these people.
    <br>When my people see me eating this food, it gives them hope that they too can become this tomorrow.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>Your life should be full of hope to others.
    <br>Let them know where you are coming from, that life, the food, the simple life...
    <br>Because you have a jeep does not mean you can't abandon the jeep and join a common vehicle to church.
    <br>Carry your children.
    <br>"This jeep - we are not going in today."
    <br>We have to join common men - this is where we are coming from.
    <br>We are coming from less privileged. We are not born with a jeep.
    <br>Don't wait until your jeep has faults before you abandon it.
    <br>Leave it.
    <br>One week with a jeep, and another week - go with the opposite.
    <br>Wait at the garage.
    <br>Let your children enter a common vehicle and come to church.
    <br>When you come back home, you tell your children that this is the life you were coming from.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>This is the mystery I'm talking about - it is full of protection.
    <br>Tell the world that it is the grace of God in your life that gave you money and position.
    <br>Not by power, not by might - don't forget these people.
    <br>Be determined.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Be determined.
    <br>Every day, stay true to your purpose despite snow or rain.
    <br>Don’t allow your situation to rule you.
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>There are sicknesses and there is a sickness:
    <br>a sickness by test and a sickness by sin, as a result of sin.
    <br>When it is to test you, it cannot destroy you -
    <br>in order to strengthen your desire and determination for God.
    <br>I'm just telling you if it is a test.
    <br>If that situation is a test, it is meant to prepare you for the future.
    <br>Like someone who is blessed - money now becomes his director, instead of the source of the money.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When money becomes the director, the one controlling you:
    <br>you have money, you change your wardrobe - fine, you can change your wardrobe,
    <br>but don't forget where you are coming from.
    <br>You have money, you leave where you were living to the midst of the rich -
    <br>there is nothing bad about that, but don't forget these people.
    <br>You have money; before now, when you were sick, you went on your knees,
    <br>asking God for prayer, deliverance and you would be delivered.
    <br>But now, money has become the director, controller, is the one controlling you,
    <br>telling you where to go, what to do.
    <br>Like we are sitting down now - the church is too warm - money.
    <br>But in those days when there was nothing, you were seeking the face of God, you could sit inside the oven.
    <br>When the money comes, you begin to look at the time.
    <br>Some will now take it up so that I will know that I should put an end to what I am saying.
    <br>They will raise it up like this.
    <br>That is money.
    <br>But in those days, your wrist watch had no battery.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>Even though you had a wrist watch, it was always late.
    <br>For two days you may not set it.
    <br>You just realised, "This wrist watch is setting me back".
    <br>I know something - simple:
    <br>the downfall of a man is when man forgets where he is coming from.
    <br>If you critically take time to notice the cause of your falling...
    <br>Before now you were blessed, you had money, everything around you,
    <br>but suddenly you don't have anything, even it is like you are begging.
    <br>If you take your time to study the cause of it,
    <br>you will know that you have forgotten where you are coming from - that is the cause.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>That is one thing - the cause.
    <br>No matter how far you go, remember where you are coming from.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>No matter how far you go, always remember where you are coming from.
    <br>Encouraging Words | Full Sermon| TB Joshua
    <br>Once possession takes control of our life, we are finished.
    <br>Possession means those things that make you, that give you honour, fame, pride, popularity.
    <br>Once that possession becomes the dictator, director, commander, you are finished.
    <br>You may not be finished immediately but soon you will be finished.
    <br>And this possession doesn't dry in a day.
    <br>Don't think that it will dry in a day.
    <br>The whole thing will start from dream.
    <br>They will begin to chase you in the dream, nightmare, having an affair in the dream, attack in the dream -
    <br>they have begun to tamper with your wealth, and that wealth will begin to...
    <br>So, take your time.
    <br>I want to leave you here.
    <br>Thank you; viewers, thank you.
