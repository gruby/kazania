    <br>begin to remove them. Is it anger, fear, resentment, pain of the past, deep hurt?
    <br>Please, deal with it before you approach the Altar
    <br>and ask God Almighty for mercy and for His divine favour.

    <br>and be a partaker of the blessings of God.
    <br>Not just climbing the Altar to pray but also having the privilege to get the Living Water.
