    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ajemina  Mac-Jaja.
    <br>I am coming from Rivers State, Nigeria.
    <br>This is my friend, Mr Bobby by name.
    <br>On the 18th of June, I went out with my friends. I am a fisher man.
    <br>I went out with my friends to catch fish in the Atlantic Ocean.
    <br>As we went in, we went with 30 sets of hooks.
    <br>Each set of hooks contains 100 hooks.
    <br>That day we threw 30 sets of hooks.
    <br>When we were about to draw in some of the hooks,
    <br>it was raining and the breeze was too much.
    <br>A very mighty wave came and sunk the boat in the Atlantic Ocean.
    <br>The wave threw me out of the canoe. There was nothing I could do.
    <br>I was holding this bag and the Anointing Sticker and Water were inside.
    <br>HOW JESUS SAVED ME WHEN MY BOAT CAPSIZED IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN!!!
    <br>I was holding this bag and the wave took me out of the boat, the bag was in the canoe.
    <br>The wave took me out of the canoe.
    <br>When I realised that I was in the water; I knew how to swim a little.
    <br>I asked my colleagues if my bag was in the canoe and they said yes.
    <br>I managed to swim over to the canoe.
    <br>It had broken into two but it was still floating under the water.
    <br>They saw the bag floating, I reached over and picked it up,
    <br>opening the zip and brought out the Anointing Sticker and Anointing Water.
    <br>I called my colleague and told him we are not going to die,
    <br>that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua will save us.
    <br>I said let us pray. We were three, the third person was shivering.
    <br>I told them to come closer and hold the sticker and let us pray.
    <br>The young man refused but the other person held onto the sticker and we prayed.
    <br>I told him that we were not going to die, that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua will rescue us.
    <br>We will not die and that satan is a liar.
    <br>We continued praying. I then said, "Come on, shout Emmanuel!"
    <br>I said, "When I shout Emmanuel, say, 'God is with us'."
    <br>I said, "Shout Emmanuel! When I shout Emmanuel, say, 'God is with us.' "
    <br>I was shouting and the other one was scared.
    <br>I said, "Don't give up. Come on, be strong."
    <br>The young man was just shivering until night came that day.
    <br>There was a 20 litre fuel can there.
    <br>Immediately I picked up the fuel can and then I cut a little rope to tie it to my waist
    <br>to hold my Anointing Water and Anointing Sticker.
    <br>It was raining and the breeze was very high.
    <br>Another wave came again and knocked me out.
    <br>If we may understand you clearly;
    <br>immediately you got hold of your bag, you brought out the Anointing Water and the Anointing Sticker,
    <br>while they were still floating in the high see.
    <br>Then, you beckoned on two of your fishermen colleagues to join you and pray with you,
    <br>that you believed that after having prayed with the Anointing Water and the Anointing Sticker,
    <br>God Almighty was going to rescue all of you.
    <br>You said one of them came and joined you in prayer, but the other one did not.
    <br>Tell us, at this point, what was your position on the high sea and what was the position of others.
    <br>How did you manage to stay on the surface, since the boat was already broken into two.
    <br>Please, can you explain.
    <br>The canoe that we used in the Atlantic Ocean, even if it sinks it doesn't go down.
    <br>The water might be like this and the canoe might be like this.
    <br>We were just holding the edge of the canoe
    <br>until another wave took me out of the canoe again.
    <br>I was holding my bag, the Anointing Water and the Anointing Sticker.
    <br>I went off until the following day which was Wednesday.
    <br>When it happened that way; the following day, Wednesday, I did not know where I was.
    <br>The only thing I saw were three things, the heaven, the water, and myself.
    <br>There was nobody to rescue me. I did not know what to do.
    <br>Then I heard a voice telling me, "Throw away the bag, this thing and swim to the rig."
    <br>I said, "Devil, you are a liar. You know I cannot swim to the rig
    <br>and you are asking me to throw away the bag, the Anointing Water and Sticker,
    <br>that means that you want to take away my life and I will not do that."
    <br>I then rebuked the devil. I said, "satan you are a liar!"
    <br>If you listened to my voice, then you would know that, yes, I had killed satan.
    <br>HOW JESUS SAVED ME WHEN MY BOAT CAPSIZED IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN!!!
    <br>Before you continue, show us again what was your position.
    <br>Tell us how did you hold on to the 20 litre can in the water, in what position it was.
    <br>I held it to my chest.
    <br>All parts of my body were in the water including part of my head.
    <br>If I wanted to talk; I would just manage to raise up my face and pray.
    <br>When I got tired I would relax myself.
    <br>When I picked up strength, I would continue praying.
    <br>It was not only the trawler that I saw; I even saw a third boat.
    <br>I was shouting but I don't think they saw me because my voice was very down.
    <br>Nobody would be able to help me.
    <br>Until when it got dark.
    <br>I said, "God of T.B. Joshua, will I die here? If I die here nobody will see my corpse."
    <br>I started thinking of so many things; all my friends, everybody I know.
    <br>I thought of my only daughter, her mother is late.
    <br>I said, "God of T.B. Joshua, my only daughter's mother is late. I am the only person taking care of her,
    <br>so if I die now, who is going to take care of her?"
    <br>After my prayer I still said, "I will not die, satan you will not kill me."
    <br>Then, I held the rubber and relaxed.
    <br>I heard a voice say, "You will not die."
    <br>When I heard that voice I thought someone had come to rescue me.
    <br>When I looked around, I did not see anyone to rescue me but I saw this ship at a distance.
    <br>I never knew that it would rescue me.
    <br>That voice telling me that I will not die told me as my back was facing the ship
    <br>to turn towards the ship and see what would happen.
    <br>Now, when I managed to turn, it was as if something was pushing me
    <br>and in 25 to 30 minutes I got close to the ship.
    <br>When I got close to the ship, I raised up my hand and the people standing started rallying around.
    <br>Here you can see the ship. I could not hold let alone throw the ship's anchor.
    <br>These things you are seeing here are at the back of the ship.
    <br>This is a cargo or rafinery ship; it refines crude oil in the Atlantic Ocean
    <br>and these are the pipes they use when sending the crude oil out.
    <br>The water pushed me to the back of the ship.
    <br>If you look at this place here, the water is being stirred and that was when they threw this lifebuoy.
    <br>When they threw it, I could not get hold of it.
    <br>They then drew the lifebuoy back and threw it again.
    <br>This is the lifebuoy and this is me in the red shirt.
    <br>When I finally got hold of the lifebuoy, I let got of the rubber thing.
    <br>Shall we put our hand together beautifully for the King of glory?
    <br>The testimony you are listening to right now confirms what the Bible said about the case of Daniel,
    <br>how God Almighty rescued him from the lion's den,
    <br>and about the case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, how God Almighty saved them from the fiery furnace.
    <br>Today, God Almighty has done another miracle to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever, to the glory of God.
    <br>Continue, sir.
    <br>That was then they brought out this boat. This is their rescue boat.
    <br>They let down the boat and rescued me and brought me onto the ship.
    <br>This was when they took me out on the stretcher. This is me.
    <br>When I was on the boat they wanted to bathe me in very hot water
    <br>but it was like they poured ice water on my body.
    <br>All parts of my body were white.
    <br>I could not feel anything.
    <br>This is the clinic on the ship where they admitted me.
    <br>God is good!
    <br>HOW JESUS SAVED ME WHEN MY BOAT CAPSIZED IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN!!!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>The pictures say it all.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty that you are alive today to testify to the goodness of God Almighty,
    <br>to what He has done in your life.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>HOW JESUS SAVED ME WHEN MY BOAT CAPSIZED IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN!!!
    <br>People of God, this Anointing Water and Sticker is real.
    <br>The power of God is inside.
