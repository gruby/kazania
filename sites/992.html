  <p>    
    <br>My name is Utuofon David Udo.
    <br>I am a student of the University of Calabar.
    <br>I have difficulty in walking because I sustained an accident.
    <br>I had a fracture on my ankle when I was driving to school.
    <br>Ok, you are a student of where?
    <br>The University of Calabar.
    <br>You mean you are still an undergraduate?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you are healed now, you will double your hair.
    <br>When you see them today - undergraduates - they begin to live as if they are working-class people.
    <br>If you now become working class, what will you put on?
    <br>This is the problem we are facing today.
    <br>Time for everything.
    <br>Can we say that our parents, after giving us the school fees,
    <br>they should give us extra money to do our hair?
    <br>This is the time to talk to her.
    <br>After healing now, you can't talk to her.
    <br>That is when you will see this.
    <br>Did you listen to me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You cannot read with this; it's not possible.
    <br>Promise - you have to cut your coat according to your size.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What are you looking for? You are a beautiful girl already.
    <br>But with this one now, you look ugly.
    <br>Remove it, you will see your beauty, okay?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank you. I think God wants me to talk to you, that is why you have this challenge.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on! Remove it!
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua begins to offer prayer to Miss Udo, he instructs one of the evangelists,
    <br>to remove the ankle brace on her leg.
    <br>This is operation.
    <br>Yes, I have had three surgeries - two in Nigeria, one in India.
    <br>And you still carry this one?
    <br>You have to make God proud.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the complete healing
    <br>of Miss Udo's ankle on which she had had three surgeries.
    <br>He tells her to rise up on her feet.
    <br>Look here.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My sister can walk!
    <br>The power of God has touched her life and she is able to walk again without the ankle brace.
    <br>Halleluyah!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>We want the lady to come forward and share her wonderful testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>Yes, we can see the glory of God radiating in the life of the sister.
    <br>Wow! To God be the glory!
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Utotofon David. I am a student of the University of Calabar.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of difficulty in walking.
    <br>I sustained a fracture of the tibia bone and left bone in a car accident in 2014 - 4th July to be precise.
    <br>I was in a car with my friend; we were driving, coming back from school.
    <br>And then we hit the biggest roundabout in Calabar and we jumped over to the other side of the road.
    <br>When we came out of the car, I discovered that I couldn't walk.
    <br>I tried to take 2 or 3 steps; I saw my leg was already swelling up and I could not walk.
    <br>So passersby took us in and took us to the hospital.
    <br>They sent for my mother. When she came, she was scared of surgery.
    <br>When she heard the fact that I was supposed to undergo an operation, she was afraid.
    <br>So she took me out from the hospital; and then she took me home.
    <br>She took me to a traditional bonesetter to try to fix my leg.
    <br>After some couple of weeks, there was still no solution and so we decided to go for the operation
    <br>that she had opted out initially.
    <br>When we went to the hospital, the doctor said, it was a little bit too late for the bone situation.
    <br>But he was still going to do the surgery. Then he operated on me the first time.
    <br>I was still having pains. There was no solution.
    <br>I went to another hospital, still in Abuja, Nigeria, and had another surgery.
    <br>There was still no solution.
    <br>So she took me to a hospital outside Nigeria; that is, in India.
    <br>They operated on me the third time, and we stayed there for three months,
    <br>so they could follow up on their physical therapies and everything.
    <br>But still there was no solution. So I got back home.
    <br>I have been going to rehabilitation centers, different places just to get a solution
    <br>but there was no solution.
    <br>It affected me in several ways. I couldn't take a shower on my own.
    <br>My siblings were the ones doing these things for me.
    <br>When they were back to school, it was my mother who would be doing those things for me.
    <br>It affected me so much in school that I had to write to my department
    <br>that they should please pardon me to write exams.
    <br>I was not even able to attend 70% of the lecture time
    <br>that is recommended for students to attend before writing exams.
    <br>They asked me to suspend my schooling until I would be totally healed.
    <br>But I could not because that was the only thing I could hold onto.
    <br>I didn't really want to be depressed due to doing nothing so they accepted it; they granted my request.
    <br>So I only went there to write exams or for some seminars.
    <br>I couldn't attend day-to-day lectures throughout this period when I was having this problem.
    <br>Tell us, why were you not able to attend the lectures? Why?
    <br>Because I couldn't walk to the lecture halls or run around as a student in school or for anything.
    <br>I was really in pains and my legs would be swelling up all the time so I could not make it.
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV where we were lodging for the very last surgery I had to undergo.
    <br>So I said to my mother that, I have been watching this TV,
    <br>and  I have seen what the man of God has been doing in people's lives.
    <br>We had gone virtually everywhere. She had done everything as a mother
    <br>to make sure that I was ok but everything was still the same.
    <br>That I would like to come here to Lagos, and come to The SCOAN
    <br>so that I can have my permanent solution.
    <br>And so she asked how I was going to come here,
    <br>because during that time, she had been following me to all the hospitals for months;
    <br>she had been staying away from her place of work and she had big problems.
    <br>She was queried or something that she had stayed away from work for so long, for some months.
    <br>So she said she could not come with me anymore
    <br>because she was already having problems at her place of work.
    <br>How was I going to come to The SCOAN?
    <br>So she called her sister and explained the situation.
    <br>So her sister send her son that could bring me to Lagos.
    <br>That was how we came to The SCOAN.
    <br>So tell us - what happened on that day?
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN last week, before the man of God even prayed for me,
    <br>he did something that only a loving father would do to his children.
    <br>He advised me.
    <br>Miss Ututofon David & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>He corrected me on some things and I promised him I was going to keep to his advice.
    <br>And that is why I'm looking like this today.
    <br>Miss Ututofon David & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Ok, tell us once again. What was the correction he gave to you?
    <br>He said I should cut my coat according to my size as a student.
    <br>That I should remove the wig that was on my hair and I should just live as a student.
    <br>Yes, to live the life of Christ so that you can be able to assimilate as a student
    <br>and live in the righteous way of the Lord.
    <br>So now, how has that advice improved your life?
    <br>I discovered that I didn't even need them anymore. I mean I have my own hair.
    <br>I didn't need to attach anything to it any more. So, the advice - it's really good.
    <br>And I can also share it to my friends.
    <br>Wow, to God be the glory. Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus!
    <br>We thank God Almighty that you have taken to that advice
    <br>and we can really see in you the glory of God.
    <br>Even looking at you now, one can see the glory of God
    <br>and the beauty of God in your life as you are looking naturally as God has created you.
    <br>Continue with your testimony.
    <br>So on that day when the man of God came to you, what happened?
    <br>I remember when I was watching Emmanuel TV in April on the resurrection morning -
    <br>that was on a Sunday - I had a dream. In that dream, I saw myself.
    <br>I was still very sick and couldn't walk and so my mother here and my elder sister,
    <br>I saw them carrying me. That I should come as there was somebody that was healing people.
    <br>That I had been in that situation for too long. That I should come.
    <br>And so they carried me - one by the left shoulder and one by the right shoulder.
    <br>They took me to a particular room and said, "Just wait, be patient, be of good courage,
    <br>it will be your turn". And so I was waiting; I was laying on a mat.
    <br>Suddenly, I heard my name. I said, "Mummy, they are calling me". She said, "Yes".
    <br>And so they took me. When I reached the hall, it was Prophet T.B. Joshua who was there.
    <br>He stood at a distance from me and just said to me, "Be healed!"
    <br>And then right from that moment when he said, "Be healed",
    <br>I experienced a sensation from my waist down, it was a shocking sensation.
    <br>That was the sensation that woke me up to reality.
    <br>So that was a spiritual manifestation of your healing, your miracle that happened.
    <br>So now tell us - what happened on that day when you now physically met
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>When I woke up, I told my mother about it when she came back from church.
    <br>She told me that though she didn't believe in dreams but what she could tell me as a mother was
    <br>that though my faith could not carry what I had just seen in the dream, her suggestion would be that
    <br>I should come to The SCOAN so that I could meet with the man of God,
    <br>so that my healing could come to reality since my faith could not take me.
    <br>When I came to Tthe SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.
    <br>As soon as he prayed for me, he told me to walk and I started walking to the glory of God.
    <br>Wow! Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So you mean, as the man of God came to you and prayed for you
    <br>and told you to stand up and walk, you found herself walking.
    <br>What you could not do before, you found yourself doing it, to the glory of God,
    <br>Yes. Even that day when I came, I was being supported by my brother there.
    <br>I was still limping, obviously. But as soon as he told me to walk, I started walking.
    <br>And right now, I can even walk much more better.
    <br>Wow. Shall we put our hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Wow. To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>Can you demonstrate to us what you can do now, what you could not do before but now you can do,
    <br>after the prayer of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua in your life.
    <br>Before, I couldn't walk without limping. If I walked, it would be so obvious  that I was limping.
    <br>But now, I can walk very well, and you wouldn't know anything. I give God the glory.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Wow. To God be the glory.
    <br>On that day, we saw you with an ankle brace.
    <br>Are you still using the ankle brace?
    <br>No, I don't need the ankle brace anymore.
    <br>You don't need it anymore. Now you can do the things you could not do before,
    <br>to the glory of God. Wow, to God be the glory.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for His miracle in your life and as you can see on the screen,
    <br>we can see the day when the man of God prayed for her and God Almighty healed her
    <br>from the problem she was having, to the glory of God.
    <br>We can even see now that you are putting on shoes. Can we see?
    <br>Could you do all this before? Could you put on shoes like this and walk around?
    <br>No I couldn't.
    <br>But now you can do them to the glory of God which shows the mightiness of God in your life.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>What advice do you have for people listening to you
    <br>because many people are also in the same condition that you were in before,
    <br>and they don't know how to go about it. What advice do you have for them?
    <br>My advice to people that are in this situation, especially to the young people, is
    <br>that after trying everything you think you can do -
    <br>I mean God's wisdom starts from where human knowledge stops.
    <br>So I advise every young person to run to God - to come to The SCOAN if you can.
    <br>But if you can't, watch Emmanuel TV, listen to the man of God and then do what he says you should do.
    <br>And then you will have your healing miracle or whatever you expect from God.
    <br>Miss Ututofon David & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my mother and the man standing beside me is my brother.
    <br>My mother's sister's son - he is my brother.
    <br>Ok. Can we just hear a few words from your mother.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Brethren, I want to thank God. I am not going to narrate the whole story again.
    <br>The young beautiful angel standing beside me is my second daughter from a family of five.
    <br>You know what it means for a young girl to have an accident - since 2014.
    <br>All I am saying now is that God has done it for me, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>God has done it so that I no longer have to carry her, carry water to her, do everything for her.
    <br>I mean, this accident did a lot of things to me - even the hypertension that I am having now,
    <br>at my place of work, everything.
    <br>It was because of the accident, running here and there.
    <br>I can remember one day that I was going to give a letter to the HOD in the University of Calabar.
    <br>As I was going, the BP started going up. I asked the driver to stop.
    <br>He said, "Madam, what happened?" I said, "I can't continue on this journey".
    <br>He asked, "Why?" I said, "Please stop. Where I am going to is far but here is nearer.
    <br>Let me just go back to the house".
    <br>I got off, after I had payed the money.
    <br>It went on like that. Till even when we travelled.
    <br>So, finally today - as I said, I am not going to narrate any story,
    <br>but all I'm saying is that God has done it for me.
    <br>And I want to thank God for this church, The SCOAN and the prophet, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>God is using him and God should keep him so that he will continue this work.
    <br>I cannot reward him, but I know that our Heavenly Father is a Rewarder
    <br>and He says in His Word that He will reward those who seek diligently for Him.
    <br>And I know that He will reward him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for the glorious testimony that has been shared by your daughter.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together once again for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almighty, sister, for what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>We just want to enjoin and employ you that now that you have been healed and set free,
    <br>you should go and make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and let your way be channelled by the Word of God.
    <br>Remember, the healing that you have received is not an end in itself
    <br>but  a means to an end which is the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Amen.
