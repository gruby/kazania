  <p>    
    <br>Greetings from Jerusalem, Israel!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The purpose and the reason why I paid such a visit to the mayor of Jerusalem was
    <br>for the important pilgrimage for the viewers and lovers of Emmanuel TV all over the world.
    <br>I want that kind of pilgrimage so you can visit places you have read so much about in the Bible.
    <br>This is why I visited the mayor of Jerusalem
    <br>and other officials, parliament and other;
    <br>to let them know that my people are 
    <br>coming from all over the world,
    <br>to pay a visit to the most important places you have read so much about.
    <br>And there are many places there that some of the pilgrimages may not have the grace to visit.
    <br>When I was there, there are some places they took me to, people don't go there because of security.
    <br>Like Abraham and Sarah sites and many other places like that.
    <br>You will not see any pilgrimage there while millions of pilgrimages are going everywhere.
    <br>I want those places for you. I want them to add that one when you are going.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, this is very important. And also to have a meeting with a tour guide to take you all over Israel.
    <br>Also to have a meeting with the authority.
    <br>So you will be recognized as a priesthood.
    <br>Not just a pilgrimage, but someone they should honor and respect when you visit them.
    <br>I love you so much. This is why I paid such a visit to Jerusalem's mayor.
    <br>I know many of you have visited many places in Israel.
    <br>There are many places you have actually never visited.
    <br>You have visited Israel many times, but there are some places you are willing to visit.
    <br>So, I think, this time is an opportunity.
    <br>When it is time, I will let you know.
    <br>It will be a quota system for each country,
    <br>Emmanuel TV viewers are all over the world.
    <br>They want to visit.
    <br>Once they are there for six days, on the seventh day I can fly there to meet and pray with them
    <br>so that by then, you would have visited everywhere.
    <br>I will be there just one or two days.
    <br>Pray with you in any location the Spirit of God directs.
    <br>Then congratulate you and come back home.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We tried to meet some tour guides that will be taking people around.
    <br>So during the testimonies, the Spirit of God reminded me and said,
    <br>"Talk to your people about LET LOVE LEAD" so that they will know so much about it.
    <br>We have been talking about this issue of love
    <br>because faith cannot work without love.
    <br>Let's just quickly look at a force called love.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of 1 John 4.
    <br>God's love and ours.
    <br>Take note of the title there.
    <br>Verse 7.
    <br>1 John 4:7
    <br>The title is "God's love and ours".
    <br>This means there are two kinds of love: God's love and ours.
    <br>Ok. I'll read verse 7.
    <br>"Dear Friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God."
    <br>Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
    <br>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This is how God showed His love among His people.
    <br>He sent His one and only son to the world that we might live through Him.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of 1 Corinthians 13:13.
    <br>"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."
    <br>So we say, LET LOVE LEAD.
    <br>What does that mean in that 1 Corinthians 13:13?
    <br>It says love is the greatest.
    <br>If love is the greatest, what else again?
    <br>If love is the greatest, this means that without love, nothing can work. You cannot work without love.
    <br>Your attitude cannot work.
    <br>If you are kind, very good, or just mention any attribute you claim you have,
    <br>without love, that cannot work.
    <br>It means if you laugh without love, you are laughing, not God.
    <br>But you can laugh and God laughs.
    <br>When we laugh in love and faith, God laughs.
    <br>When you pray in love and faith, God prays.
    <br>So you say you are the one praying; no, it's God
    <br>When you preach in love and faith, God preaches.
    <br>So, in that 1 John 4:7, it says,
    <br>"Beloved, let us love for love is God and God is love".
    <br>Everyone who loves is born of God for love is God and God is love.
    <br>Can you see the position of God when I say LET LOVE LEAD?
    <br>You say, what is the meaning? How can love lead?
    <br>If you fail to walk in love, you almost shut down your spiritual walk with the Lord.
    <br>Failure to walk in love can almost shut down our spiritual walk with the Lord.
    <br>It can shut down your relationship with God - failure to walk in love.
    <br>When I say LET LOVE LEAD, you should understand what I am talking about.
    <br>Love is the force that sets everything working.
    <br>Your kindness, goodness, humility, faith, just mention any quality you can talk about.
    <br>Love is the force that sets them working.
    <br>Without love, your kindness, goodness, faithfulness and obedience will be dormant.
    <br>When you say, [laughing] without love,
    <br>you are laughing of yourself.
    <br>[Laughing] with love - of God.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>Tell your neighbor.
    <br>[Love looks around to see who is in need.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Love looks around to see who is in need.]
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is unsaved.
    <br>You have love?
    <br>The love of God?
    <br>Love looks around. As you are sitting, you look around you.
    <br>Who is sick? What can you do to help?
    <br>What assistance can you give?
    <br>You begin to think about that because you are born of love.
    <br>You begin to think about this man sitting at my back,
    <br>the way I am looking at him, he is not comfortable.
    <br>You may because of the man move toward the usher.
    <br>And say, "Usher, please, can I see you?
    <br>There is a man at my back. It is like he needs help and I don't know how to go about it.
    <br>Please, would you approach him?"
    <br>When you look around you, you will see those who are in need of what you have.
    <br>Maybe he does not have anything, no money to buy food.
    <br>He even had to borrow money to come here.
    <br>You can now on your own, "Excuse me. How are you?" - "Fine".
    <br>"I know, you would like to see me." He would not mind to see you - "yes!"
    <br>But your own love, one must meet you and say, "Uncle, I need your help".
    <br>That is your love.
    <br>"Uncle, I need your help. I have not eaten today. Please help me."
    <br>You will now bring money out. That is your own love
    <br>which is not God's love.
    <br>This is why the title here says, "God's love and ours".
    <br>Your own love - if they do not ask you, you will not [give].
    <br>If the person is not falling, you will not help.
    <br>You always help for selfish, classic, and material reasons.
    <br>For reasons known to you, you help.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need, crying, lamenting.
    <br>If you have that love, God will give you His face and His eyes to see them.
    <br>No matter how little or how poor you are,
    <br>there are many people that are still in need of what you have;
    <br>people you are better than.
    <br>When you say you don't have anything, Ok.
    <br>There could be something better than anything.
    <br>Something can be better than anything, but your language is always, "I don't have anything".
    <br>Take this word:
    <br>The world needs to see our unity and our love for one another.
    <br>If we have God's love, the world would see our unity and our love for one another.
    <br>Yes, if you have God's love; the world would see our unity and our love for one another.
    <br>But we fight ourselves.
    <br>If you know you cannot join bare fighting, you just remain quiet.
    <br>This is why I remain quiet because you will not be able to quote me.
    <br>If I want to be your friend and I know you are not ready to be my friend, you remain quiet.
    <br>I am not isolated but I decided to be quiet because which direction will I follow?
    <br>Yes, that does not stop me; that is my nature.
    <br>I will not live by history, I will live according to God's what?
    <br>God's direction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I will live according to God's direction.
    <br>Just like the last time I traveled, when I traveled to Israel,
    <br>I said OK, I must pay a visit to Bethlehem.
    <br>When I entered Bethlehem, I said, "No, I will not enter Bethlehem without seeing the mayor of Bethlehem.
    <br>It is not possible for me.
    <br>If I am not going to see the mayor of Bethlehem, I will not go to Bethlehem".
    <br>People were saying, "Mayor of Bethlehem? Who is this man?"
    <br>Then, I introduced myself, "I am T.B. Joshua".
    <br>Before I knew it, they quickly searched the internet, "250 million follow this man all over the world".
    <br>"Anywhere/whoever you want to visit, we are ready to take you there."
    <br>They are not like us Africans here.
    <br>They respect people's integrity...
    <br>You know, the internet is a global thing.
    <br>If you say you are somebody, they will type your name; simple!
    <br>They give a call, "So and so person" - "What is the name?" - "T.B. Joshua."
    <br>Just T.B. Joshua without going on the internet,
    <br>the mayor said, "please, I am going to abandon everything; I want to see the man.
    <br>Please let him come".
    <br>As I came, he said, "How are you?" - "Fine".
    <br>We discussed... "I am here in your city Bethlehem.
    <br>Since you are the governor and everything here,
    <br>before I will enter the city, I said, "Let me say hello to you".
    <br>He entertained me and gave me an award and we discussed...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So from there, they appointed a tour guide.
    <br>"Sir, where or anywhere you want to go, this tour guide will take you around."
    <br>I said, "OK, but I still want to come back and see you, Mayor". He said, "OK".
    <br>Moving around, they took me to one hospital;
    <br>we were just passing it on the way to the place we were going to see;
    <br>and I saw sick people everywhere.
    <br>People were saying...
    <br>You know I am not used to see people in pain.
    <br>Even when I am praying for people here, and I see people in pain; I will turn my back and stretch my hand.
    <br>When I see the pain, I feel it myself.
    <br>I said, " Lord, I will not be able to pass this hospital.
    <br>Where are we going?"
    <br>We now approached the chief medical director there.
    <br>He said, "Many of these people don't have machines for dialysis and they are so many". I said, "OK".
    <br>I said, "Look, I am going back. I am not going to be able to go far.
    <br>Let me go back, I am going to see the mayor".
    <br>They said, "Let us go, move forward"; I said, "No, no, I am going to see the mayor".
    <br>When I got to the mayor, he said, "Have you finished moving around?"
    <br>I said, "No, no, I can't move around.
    <br>I saw people on the sickbed, they complained about machines for dialysis...
    <br>What can we do to support? These people should not die just like that".
    <br>The mayor now gave a call to the chief medical director.
    <br>"What are the challenges about dialysis machines?"
    <br>They said, they need almost 20 to 30 dialysis machines.
    <br>I said, "Right now, I am going to provide it".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have provided the machines for them; as I am talking now, they are with them.
    <br>We provided the machines, dialysis machines. We provided all for them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And the woman mayor said, "Ha!"
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Don't take me by my name Prophet, take me by 'love'.
    <br>My name is love.
    <br>Message Title: LET LOVE LEAD
    <br>You are the ones who call me prophet, pastor, bishop, whatever name you call me.
    <br>That is the name you gave me.
    <br>But the name God gave me from heaven is 'love'.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You call me bishop, prophet, general overseer of The Synagogue, whatever name.
    <br>I will answer you because I don't want to hurt you.
    <br>You say, "Papa". - "Hmm."
    <br>How can you see?
    <br>Can your papa at home do like this?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you see me like this and call me papa, God will forgive you.
    <br>You cannot be papa twice, only once. Young once, old once, brother once, sister once.
    <br>Once you are sister, as time goes on, they will not call you sister again.
    <br>Wait for when I will be papa.
    <br>Message Title: LET LOVE LEAD
    <br>Let someone say, "Let love lead".
    <br>We are all one.
    <br>Whatever you can do to change the world, whatever - change the world.
    <br>Don't begin to hide under Jesus Christ.
    <br>Don't hide under Christianity.
    <br>Don't hide under the name bishop, the name prophet.
    <br>Change and help!
    <br>Save souls.
    <br>I know many of us will say, "Ah, we have many hospitals in Nigeria
    <br>that are in need of dialysis machines".
    <br>But what about our name that has been spoiled all over the world? How do we repair this name?
    <br>That name Nigeria where I travel to all over,
    <br>they look at Nigeria differently, they say, "No, no, no, this one is from Nigeria? No.
    <br>What you are saying about Nigeria is quite different".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You that can do the one at home, continue doing it. We that can do the one outside,
    <br>the name that has been spoiled outside, let us go and repair that name.
    <br>The belief is that Africans only ask anywhere we enter, "Give me, give me".
    <br>That is the impression of people outside in the world.
    <br>No matter how rich an African man - "Give me, give me!"
    <br>No, we should change this impression.
    <br>We too can give.
    <br>We can give out of the little we have. Let's give, let's begin to give.
    <br>You say you are poor. Who told you you are poor?
    <br>Your parents told you you are poor. But God does not say you are poor.
    <br>Give!
    <br>Let them know that, "No, the time of "give us, give us'" -
    <br>it is also the time we can give them and they too give us.
    <br>"Give us, give us." - let us give, let us exchange.
    <br>The western world, all over the world - they are human beings like us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not that I have so much. But I just feel that out of the little I have,
    <br>I can give to change some impression we find.
    <br>We are little but the generation of yesterday and the generation of today,
    <br>the impression we create outside the world is very, very bad.
    <br>We are not doing it to show off, no. It is a way of letting love lead.
    <br>Like I have said: A lot of things are going on all over the world.
    <br>In Africa, there are problems. We are the ones destroying our continent.
    <br>We use our mouth to destroy our continent.
    <br>We don't appreciate our people.
    <br>I mean, we don't appreciate our people.
    <br>After meeting the mayor, I was taken to the parliament.
    <br>While sitting, I looked at myself, remembered my Africa and said, "Oh!"
    <br>I nearly cried and said, "Africa!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I was talking about universities last time and African universities all over.
    <br>Can you believe that I am invited to an American university,
    <br>one of the biggest university to come and deliver a lecture?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am invited to Alabama and many other states to come and deliver lectures.
    <br>The students say, "Yes, we want this man to come and speak to us".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are big universities and I am still in-between asking God,
    <br>"Should I go or not go?"
    <br>I know if I just visit one, it means,
    <br>every week all over the world I would be receiving invitations to deliver lectures at universities.
    <br>I pray the Lord will give me the opportunity to visit some of these universities.
    <br>I have my area of specialization I am going to talk about. I am not a professor.
    <br>But I will talk about an area where they would appreciate God better.
    <br>Education is not success, it is to help us succeed.
    <br>It is not that success but it helps us succeed.
    <br>That is why you can be a criminal or anything and yet come first class.
    <br>You can be one of the cult members in the school,
    <br>you can be a criminal or a thug - this is why we find it difficult to understand our children.
    <br>We love them because they are very brilliant, but we don't know that some of them are criminals.
    <br>They are very brilliant but at the same time they are criminals.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why should this be?
    <br>If you are very brilliant, you should not be a criminal.
    <br>Why should you be a criminal and the best student in the school?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A thug and the best student in the school, first class.
    <br>Why these two things should go together?
    <br>This is where children of God get confused.
    <br>You say, I read, read, I read, look at me, third class.
    <br>And this guy, I know him to be very wayward in the school.
    <br>He is a member of a cult -  first class.
    <br>So, this is why children of God get confused.
    <br>You say, I read, I read all the time, I read my book all the time, I pray, I fast,
    <br>I meet my pastor for prayer and other but at the end I came third class.
    <br>But I know this student very wayward, he never believes God.
    <br>He always goes to parties, night clubs;
    <br>and I don't know when he or she reads but now first class.
    <br>This is an area where students need someone to come and talk to them.
    <br>Why things should happen like that so that they will not get confused that God is unfaithful.
    <br>Students need to understand this...
    <br>If you have prayed and you have been walking in the Lord, in love,
    <br>and you have been doing the right thing and you know that you are a believer
    <br>and at the end of the day you came third class, give thanks to God
    <br>because your third class will give you a better future than first class.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why today when you look at the record of heroes, generals, people that are there today,
    <br>90% of them came third class.
    <br>Even third class lower.
    <br>Even failure.
    <br>But today they are the heroes.
    <br>Whereas 80% of people on the street that will say, "I'm a graduate" - first class.
    <br>80% that are on the street looking for jobs or
    <br>doing what they have not prayed to do, what they did not plan to do or like to do,
    <br>80% of them - first class.
    <br>It is not what you come out with. It is the force behind what you come out with.
    <br>I can have $5 and you have $10,000
    <br>and my $5 will be more valuable than your $10,000.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>I may have $10,000 and you have $1,000,000.
    <br>My $10,000 will be more valuable than your $1,000,000.
    <br>It depends on how we came about the money: the processing.
    <br>It is process that works.
    <br>What works? - Process.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Process.
    <br>Look at marriages today.
    <br>Many marriages that the whole world is present, with gifts of billions of dollars,
    <br>90% of such marriages are broken today.
    <br>Whereas some marriages nobody knew about are the ones still there as husband and wife.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Process - let someone say, "Process".
    <br>If your process to acquire first class is not godly,
    <br>but you are very brilliant and you do not live a godly life,
    <br>and someone whose process is godly
    <br>and later comes out third class lower, or even failure or pass,
    <br>he will achieve what we call greatness in the future than you that have the first class.
    <br>It is a matter of time.
    <br>You people are out there, you have many histories.
    <br>Look at all this Facebook we are talking about - the founder of Facebook.
    <br>You go and read about him - that young man. He abandoned university.
    <br>So, the question is about process.
    <br>The process of your marriage.
    <br>The process of being a pastor.
    <br>The process of being a prophet.
    <br>The process of being president of a country.
    <br>The process of being a senator of a country.
    <br>The process of being head of a department.
    <br>That process will continue to work for you, work against you, work for you.
    <br>How do you become the Managing Director of the company?
    <br>You are a Managing Director, you know you run to witch doctors
    <br>to make sure that the former Managing Director is dismissed.
    <br>The result does not matter; process matters.
    <br>Your results may be bad but your process is good. It is a matter of time; fold your hand.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be dismissed unlawfully and someone is asked to take your position.
    <br>It is a matter of time; fold your hand.
    <br>So, all this is life.
    <br>This is why you see people like me here today.
    <br>It is because of process that I am still alive.
    <br>It is not because of results. It is not because of what is happening, miracles, this or that...
    <br>That is not the reason why I am still alive and get stronger.
    <br>Because of process - I quietly follow the process of the Lord.
    <br>I know the Lord will be there for me.
    <br>That is process.
    <br>Process!
    <br>If you dupe your fellow brother to get billions of dollars and become a millionaire, it is not yet over.
    <br>Process - let someone say, "Process". It is not yet over.
    <br>It is not yet over; it is a matter of time. You will still crumble one day.
    <br>And you will be on the street begging.
    <br>Let someone say, "Process".
    <br>So that is why for many of you, any time there is trouble,
    <br>somebody duped you, somebody tried to do something against you, you are so bitter.
    <br>Don't be bitter.
    <br>Just keep holding on to God. No one can cheat you and go.
    <br>It is a matter of time.
    <br>If somebody takes something that belongs to you, he takes it away and is using it, it is a matter of time.
    <br>Process.
    <br>So the problem many of you are facing today is as a result of the wrong process
    <br>because you want to follow shortcuts.
    <br>It is a normal thing that 1 + 1 + 1 is equal to 3.
    <br>But you want to say 1 + 2.
    <br>If I am talking to you - the normal process to get 3 is 1 + 1 + 1 is equal to what? - 3.
    <br>But in your own case, because you are impatient, it is 1 + 2.
    <br>That 2 you don't want to simplify it or break it at all; you want to have 3 immediately.
    <br>If it was possible, you would say 3 is equal to 3.
    <br>It is not too late; you can start afresh because God loves you so much.
    <br>If you have taken a wrong process, start afresh.
    <br>If it is a wrong process you have followed and you are getting it and enjoying...
    <br>A time is coming.

    <br>So please work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.
    <br>Say it again!
    <br>Again!
    <br>[Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.]
    <br>Work as if everything depends on you.
    <br>That is, when you are working hard and hard, put all your effort.
    <br>While you are praying to God...
    <br>We don't know how to pray. 
    <br>The Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness.
    <br>Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything...
    <br>Tell your children at home, "Read as if everything depends on you; pray as if everything depends on God".
    <br>Tell your children. So please.
    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
