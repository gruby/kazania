    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Come on, come here!
    <br>You pose as a pastor.  Are you really a pastor?
    <br>Yes, sir!
    <br>Because I'm seeing you acting and doing the work of a pastor.
    <br>Yes, sir!
    <br>Are you a pastor?
    <br>Yes, sir!
    <br>But if you are a pastor, what is your business with rituals?
    <br>I needed money.
    <br>You went there to do what?
    <br>To take money.
    <br>He is my husband, Man of God, please deliver him!
    <br>Man of God, please deliver him.
    <br>He is a pastor.
    <br>He used to do the work of God.
    <br>Come out.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Pastor Stephen Zoryiku.
    <br>I'm a first year marketing student at Accra Polytechnic.
    <br>This is my wife Evelyn and we are from Ghana.
    <br>On Monday, the prophet gave me a prophecy that he saw me as a pastor
    <br>and I said "yes" and he asked what my connection was with rituals.
    <br>I confirmed that to be true because
    <br>because after my Bible school I started preaching the Word of God to people
    <br>and praying for them as well.
    <br>One evening whilst I was passing, I met this guy on the floor
    <br>with people gathered around him.
    <br>The man said that he was seeing some short demons piercing his chest with spears.
    <br>He said he was dying.
    <br>I felt moved by the power of God to pray for him.
    <br>I went home, took some anointing oil, went back and started praying.
    <br>As soon as I started, this man got up and started beating me.
    <br>The following day, I did not feel okay.
    <br>I began to feel like taking ritual money.
    <br>It continued and then, one of my friends took me to a ritualist to take ritual money.
    <br>They demanded for five human fingers and an embryo
    <br>which I was not able to provide.
    <br>So I left and then relocated to another town with my wife.
    <br>Everything began to fall apart, including my business.
    <br>I had a very strong feeling that I needed to take that money
    <br>in order to be free at once and for all.
    <br>I started moving around, looking for where I could get it.
    <br>When I came here with my wife to Nigeria,
    <br>the feeling became so strong and I decided that this was the time to take it.
    <br>So I looked around for somewhere I could take money.
    <br>I went there with the mind that whatever they demanded from me,
    <br>I would be ready to give.
    <br>So I went to a ritualist and told him about my situation, that I wanted money
    <br>and he said that before he could start anything, I needed to bring N10,000.
    <br>I didn't have the money so I told him I would be back.
    <br>I got home and then came together with my wife to church,
    <br>and received the prophecy from the man of God.
    <br>After the prophecy, the thought of taking ritual money is gone.
    <br>Before, I would dream of short demons chasing me with axes
    <br>and I would see people coming to steal my money and many other dreams.
    <br>Now, I no longer have such dreams.
    <br>So I give thanks to God for delivering me.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>There is trouble all over the world.
    <br>Even the trouble in the House of God is so much.
    <br>Who is a pastor now? Who is a prophet, all over the world?
    <br>That is the trouble now.
    <br>There is trouble, so we need to pray for the church.
    <br>Please rise up, let's pray for the church.
    <br>Pray for the church. Ask God to redeem the church.
    <br>Redeem the assembly.
    <br>Ask God to purge the church.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray.
    <br>Ask God to purge the church, overhaul the church.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Remember your pastor in prayer.
    <br>Ask God to guide your pastor.
    <br>If your pastor needs to be purged, ask God to purge him.
    <br>Purge him, sanctify him.
    <br>Make real church.
    <br>Let the Church of the Acts of the Apostles come down in our day.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Brother, you have seen everything that happened. So we thank God.
    <br>If I were you now, the words "I'm a pastor" you still lay a claim on,
    <br>why can't you just let us pray and ask God, "What is Your direction?"
    <br>Okay, I think this is what we're going to do now.
    <br>So thank you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
