    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Where is your wife?
    <br>She was in the church.
    <br>She went for a meeting right now.
    <br>That is your first wife.
    <br>It is my wife, my only wife.
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>OK, sir.
    <br>Because there is a controversy.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Wow!
    <br>My name is Henry Nwajames.
    <br>The person beside me is my lovely wife.
    <br>As you saw from the telecast on that fateful day, the servant of Jesus Christ Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>was moving about.
    <br>As he was coming towards me, inside me I was praying that this servant of God will talk to me.
    <br>I was thinking about how he would speak about my breakthrough - my millions and my businesses -
    <br>not knowing that he would take me to a different direction.
    <br>When he eventually got to me, he asked if he could speak to me.
    <br>I told him that he could go ahead and speak to me.
    <br>He asked about my wife and my wife had just left for a meeting.
    <br>I told him that my wife had just left for a meeting. He said, "Your first wife".
    <br>I could not understand.
    <br>Before I knew it, he said, "There is a controversy".
    <br>As God would have it, before I could get to my house that fateful day, my wife had returned from the meeting,
    <br>my mother-in-law and brothers and sisters were all in the house.
    <br>They were watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>As I left the church, I didn't understand anything.
    <br>My mind didn't even take me to where the Holy Spirit was taking me.
    <br>When I got home, the woman shouted, "Didn't you know what to tell the man of God?"
    <br>She asked if I had forgotten the story I told her about my daughter somewhere.
    <br>I said, "Oh, are you sure that is what the man of God is talking about?"
    <br>I said, "But I don't know how to go about it".
    <br>I had to contact my cousin who was the only person who knew about the issue.
    <br>It was in those early days when I was a child.
    <br>I did disco jockeying in those days.
    <br>On my father's side is very close to where I used to do disco jockeying.
    <br>That is the place I used to meet with this young lady who begot this girl.
    <br>So, when this matter happened - not that I didn't hear about it - my brother came and told me
    <br>that the girl was pregnant.
    <br>He asked me: "What do we do about it?"
    <br>He said: "Since that is the case, you have to rush away from here
    <br>because everybody knows that this place is your maternal home.
    <br>If this thing happens, I don't know what will happen next".
    <br>That is how I ran away from my father's place and maternal home.
    <br>I unwillingly gave her my cousin's telephone number.
    <br>When she called the young man, he said: "Right now, I don't know how to trace this girl
    <br>but give me some time; I will know what to do about it".
    <br>One day, my cousin called me that the aunty to my daughter was late and that it was an opportunity
    <br>for me to see her.
    <br>I told him that when he saw her, he should let me know.
    <br>The young man called us later on and told us that he had got her number and information about her.
    <br>Before I knew it, he called me and said that this lady's husband had just died.
    <br>He said that that was the information that he had just got now.
    <br>I said: "Wow", and then he said: "What should we do?"
    <br>I replied: "This is an opportunity for us to see her".
    <br>Before we knew it, one day he called me to say he had called the girl she was coming and that we should come.
    <br>I was unwillingly to go but my wife insisted that I should come.
    <br>She said: "Let me go and see. Do you want me to die in poverty?"
    <br>I said that I was sorry and that she should go and find out.
    <br>I was in my house and my wife called me back to say that people were crying and shouting,
    <br>saying: "Look, at what you have done".
    <br>I said that I was very sorry, that she should help me to tell her that I was sorry.
    <br>Regarding the controversy that the man of God was talking about,
    <br>the husband that died needed to be buried on the 27th of December.
    <br>I said that I would send my wife and family but when they got there, the burial was no longer conducted
    <br>which is the controversy that the man of God was talking about.
    <br>When they came back, I was told that a letter had come from the court, asking them to leave the house,
    <br>that the children and wife no longer belong to the husband.
    <br>I did not understand.
    <br>Hallelujah. We have been listening to the experience of Mr. Henry Nwajames, to his explaining that
    <br>the prophecy he received from Prophet T.B. Joshua concerning his first wife and a controversy is very true.
    <br>When he was young man, long time before he got married, he had a relationship with a lady.
    <br>He was very young at that time.
    <br>The lady became pregnant but because of the shame and everything attached to that he denied that baby
    <br>and the entire family also denied that baby.
    <br>He said that when the man of God mentioned this to him he didn't even think about it.
    <br>It was only a friend who reminded him that he had told him a story about how he had impregnated a lady
    <br>when he was very very small.
    <br>Since that time he could not trace the girl, he had never seen the girl, he had no fatherly relation with the girl.
    <br>In fact he didn't even know where the girl was.
    <br>After the man's of God prophecy, he asked the particular family member who knew about the case
    <br>to try and trace this particular girl and found out that she had married but her husband had just died
    <br>and there was a lot of controversy surrounding the death of her husband, and the burial was unable to hold.
    <br>People were even accusing this girl of being behind her husband's death.
    <br>This thing happened about 28 years ago and I've not seen this girl with my eyes
    <br>'til today when I invited my cousin to help me trace her.
    <br>We are in the church now and it is the first time I am meeting her.
    <br>This situation has actually held him in bondage for many years.
    <br>The business collapsed, everything collapsed.
    <br>He had been struggling to get it right - no way.
    <br>But he never thought there was something, somewhere.
    <br>Not, until this prophetic word.
    <br>The child is inside the church now - he has never seen this child.
    <br>Let the child come out.|
    <br>For how many years?
    <br>For 28 years.
    <br>... you saw her last?
    <br>I've not seen her before.
    <br>You don't even know her?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Mr Henry Nwajames' Daughter & Grandchildren
    <br>Look at the woman and at this man.
    <br>Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Can you see the picture of both of them?
    <br>Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>See those two faces.
    <br>Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Can you stand up and tell God, "God, reveal my own"?
    <br>[God, reveal my own.]
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Let God reveal your own.
    <br>The father and the daughter are there now.
    <br>They don't know whether to hug themselves or to greet themselves...
    <br>The lady started to cry.
    <br>Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>He is my cousin.
    <br>He is the one that knows our secret.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>They are your children.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You have to forgive your dad because this is by revelation not by human hands.
    <br>It has been your prayer.
    <br>What have been your prayers before now?
    <br>All my life, I have been praying to see him.
    <br>All your life you have been praying to see him?
    <br>But your mommy gave you some pictures in the past.
    <br>She didn't tell anything.
    <br>Your mommy didn't tell you anything?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>All my life, I have been staying with my grandmother.
    <br>That is, the person that I took as my mother but I didn't know she was my grandmother.
    <br>So, she died here in 1999.
    <br>That was when I came to Lagos to stay with her son and his wife.
    <br>The family did not register me for the SSCE exam.
    <br>One day, I was having an issue with them, so the wife called me a bastard.
    <br>The husband then said that I behave like my father.
    <br>So, I ran away from the house and went to meet my uncle because he lives closer to the house.
    <br>So, I told my uncle what the man had said, calling me a bastard and asked him if he knew anything about it
    <br>or if not, I would kill myself or I would run away from the house.
    <br>He told me that I had a father but it was a secret.
    <br>I asked him what kind of secret could he not tell me about in my situation.
    <br>He replied that it was a secret that nobody knew about except him, my mother and my father.
    <br>I said: "OK, if you cannot tell me anything about it, it is better for me to run away".
    <br>So, I run away from his house.
    <br>Unfortunately, the husband and wife found out where I was living.
    <br>After my SSCE exam, she has a restaurant in Lagos island,
    <br>and she said I should help her sell in her beer parlour, restaurant.
    <br>There was where I was staying with her and helping her to sell.
    <br>All through those days, I was crying and weeping because I was going through trials and temptation.
    <br>At any little thing that I did, she would repeat that I was a bastard.
    <br>Anywhere I was, I would be telling God: "I need to know where I come from".
    <br>She then introduced me to one man who is my husband now.
    <br>She said that I should go and marry him.
    <br>At that time, I was only 16 years old.
    <br>OK, it is all right.
    <br>What would you...?
    <br>You have... I don't know - this is your daughter.
    <br>Man of God, please...
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I think I need to sit...
    <br>And these are your children?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>This is my first born and this is the second born.
    <br>So, we thank God for this revelation.
    <br>The name of God is so wonderful.
    <br>This is a job for you.
    <br>Since God has shown so much mercy and kindness, ... I don't know.
    <br>So, help me to take them to the round table.
    <br>The father will do the right thing over there, not in an open space here, OK?
    <br>My daughter, please.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Mr Henry Nwajames & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>The reconciliation will not happen in the place where you or me will be.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Mr. Nwajames with his family, daughter and grandchildren were taken to a quiet,
    <br>pleasant environment, where they could have some privacy and enjoy their first meal together.
    <br>Now, they have been reunited as a family through the prophetic revelation of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Served with some rice and freshly squeezed orange juice they were ready to begin.
    <br>But before the meal, the family had something to say.
    <br>My name is Henry Nwajames.
    <br>The person by my side is my lovely wedded wife.
    <br>The person on my left side is my found daughter, whom I am just seeing for the first time after 28 years.
    <br>The brother here is my cousin who knows a little bit about us.
    <br>When we were playing all these pranks in those days when we were kids, he used to be there with me.
    <br>These are my grandchildren.
    <br>You can see how beautiful they are.
    <br>This is a blessing.
    <br>She is my daughter's first daughter and this is Uche, the son.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was the prophecy that the man of God gave me sometime in 2012.
    <br>The man of God walked up to me.
    <br>I had prayed: "I want this man of God to meet me today; I want this man of God to speak to my situation".
    <br>I thought he was going to tell me that I would win the contract or that my millions would come tomorrow
    <br>but when he came to me, it hit me in a way that I could not understand.
    <br>He asked me where my wife was.
    <br>I replied that my wife had left for a meeting, right from the church.
    <br>He said that he meant my very first wife.
    <br>I told him that I have one wife and that she was my only wife.
    <br>He said that there was a controversy.
    <br>I could not understand or even remember that I once had an encounter sometime, somewhere.
    <br>I did not think that the prophecy had anything to do with me having abandoned my daughter.
    <br>When I got home, my wife who was not in the church at that moment, had already returned from her meeting.
    <br>So, she was at home with my mother, my other children and relations.
    <br>They were all watching Emmanuel TV and saw the whole thing.
    <br>When I got home, my wife pounced on me and asked me: "Have you forgotten the story you told me?
    <br>Where is the telephone number of your cousin?"
    <br>She asked me if I had forgotten about the girl I told her about.
    <br>I said: "No, the man of God did not say so. I did not marry her".
    <br>She said: "No, what the man of God said is not too far from this thing".
    <br>It was then that I took out my cousin's telephone number and she started calling my cousin immediately.
    <br>I didn't know that what had 'brushed' me down and shattered me was my ignorance at this big mistake
    <br>which I never knew.
    <br>Meanwhile on my own side, this had affected me tremendously.
    <br>I could not even understand myself anymore.
    <br>I was a big boy; I was doing so well.
    <br>I had projects in my village; I was the first to build a storied building.
    <br>At the end, I was selling my properties.
    <br>I had landed properties and sold all.
    <br>I went overseas and brought this and that but at the end of the day, I could not account for anything.
    <br>As I was coming to the church, I was praying that God would open my way
    <br>and show me the root cause of my problem.
    <br>As God would have it, that fateful day, the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>When we got home, we focused on the prophecy and started looking for this girl
    <br>and that was how this discovery came about.
    <br>I thank God today that she is here and I have been appealing to her to forgive me.
    <br>This was what I did out of ignorance as a young man.
    <br>That time, I was afraid that if my relations saw me, they would kill me
    <br>or tell me that I had committed one abomination or the other.
    <br>That was why I left, not knowing that, that place was where my dad's mum came from.
    <br>I could have married from that village.
    <br>The only family I could not have married into was my cousin's family.
    <br>My mind was strengthened and I knew that God had forgiven me.
    <br>I didn't care what anybody would say.
    <br>My cousin, on his own part did his best because he always told me that
    <br>I was the only one that knew about this child and that I should not forget.
    <br>When he texted me, I didn't take it seriously.
    <br>My daughter, I'm very sorry.
    <br>I know I've sinned before God and before people.
    <br>But please, I am appealing to you, my daughter; forgive me.
    <br>Now that I have seen my daughter for the first time, after all these years, it is a fulfilled day.
    <br>I am happy.
    <br>My daughter, please, forgive me.
    <br>I am very sorry, my daughter, please, forgive me!
    <br>I promise to carry you along.
    <br>As far as I have seen you, nothing whatsoever will separate us anymore as long as the love of God
    <br>is working in our lives.
    <br>My daughter!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>My name is Chidindu.
    <br>I am so happy.
    <br>I don't know what to say.
    <br>I thank God for today that He has made it possible for me to see a day like this.
    <br>I don't know how to say it.
    <br>I am overwhelmed.
    <br>I am so happy because all of my life, I didn't even know what a father was.
    <br>I had never ever tasted fatherly love.
    <br>Sometimes, I would go to my friends' houses;
    <br>their fathers would pamper them and I would ask God: "Who is my father?"
    <br>But today, God made it possible for me to see my father and mother.
    <br>She is my mother because without her, this would never had happened.
    <br>It is not every woman who can go through this and still fish out the person they had been looking for.
    <br>I will never ever in this life forget her because I am so happy.
    <br>Sometime ago, my husband used to ask me: "Are you sure you are going to see your father?"
    <br>I replied that he should not worry that one day, I would see my father.
    <br>This is unfortunate that he doesn't witness it today.
    <br>I am so happy.
    <br>Despite all that I have been through all my life, today, I am so happy!
    <br>God used the man of God to prophesy my case.
    <br>I was not here but God used him to prophecy my case.
    <br>I am so happy and I thank God and every member of this church who helped and witnessed today.
    <br>From today, I have forgiven my father.
    <br>I promise to remain your dad.
    <br>You are my first daughter.
    <br>We used to call a first daughter in my place, 'Ada'.
    <br>She is 'Ada'.
    <br>My name is Eddie Anyiam.
    <br>I thank God for today.
    <br>I witnessed my brother and his daughter.
    <br>I was there when the whole thing happened.
    <br>I promised my sister that I would keep the secret for security reasons, which I did.
    <br>Since then, things had not been easy for me because I was carrying a load that I was not able to bear.
    <br>One day, my sister came to me and told me that she did not want to go back to her uncle again.
    <br>I asked her why and whether there was any problem.
    <br>She replied that I would not understand.
    <br>I asked her why she said that I would not understand, that she should tell me.
    <br>She replied that she would not tell me.
    <br>We started to argue and she said that if I didn't want her to stay in my house, she would go.
    <br>I said: "Please, don't leave; let me settle this matter".
    <br>She said she didn't want to go to that place anymore, that she wanted to stay with me –
    <br>to take me as her brother – everything.
    <br>She said that those people were calling her a bastard.
    <br>When I heard that, I wondered why they were calling this young girl by that name,
    <br>was it because her mother was dead.
    <br>I told her that she was not a bastard and that she should calm down.
    <br>She told me that if she continued to go to that place, she would run away and commit suicide or drink poison.
    <br>I asked her not to kill herself, that I knew her dad, that she should keep the secret.
    <br>Today, I am happy that God has revealed the secret and I am happy that I have seen my brother.
    <br>I thank God for my brother's wife; she made it possible for us to be together.
    <br>This is my first time of coming to this church.
    <br>I lost my wife over five years ago.
    <br>I have one boy and one girl and I am not finding things easy.
    <br>I don’t know whether it was the curse of my sister, here that was causing me disappointment in life.
    <br>People would make promises to me but in the end, they would disappoint me.
    <br>But I thank God that the bondage has been removed.
    <br>I thank God for the man of God and for my cousin's wife and for my junior sister.
    <br>It is well.
    <br>From today I am a member of this church.
    <br>I have seen the work of God here.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ijeoma Nwajames.
    <br>I want to thank God for today because God has made it happen in my life.
    <br>I see these things happening in other families.
    <br>I have seen miracles since I've been watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>This is a family, that when I entered into it newly in marriage, everything was there for me.
    <br>Money was there and fleets of cars.
    <br>I had pleasures.
    <br>I didn't know that the world could change all of a sudden.
    <br>I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>As I was living in luxury, I had seven biological children.
    <br>I didn't know that one day, I would be begging for food to take care of those children.
    <br>All of a sudden, everything started withering – going down.
    <br>We were all wondering.
    <br>Then, we didn't know about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We were wondering what was happening.
    <br>We have attended a lot of churches.
    <br>Some churches we attended did some sacrifices.
    <br>A lot of things had happened in our lives.
    <br>We didn't know what was really happening.
    <br>When the man of God gave the prophecy, I called him,
    <br>though I was not in the church by the time the prophecy came.
    <br>I asked him about his first wife.
    <br>He said that he didn't have a first wife.
    <br>I reminded him about the story he told me.
    <br>We were praying that God would visit us the way He had visited other people.
    <br>When he told me about it, I told him that the prophecy was talking about this child, though the mother was late.
    <br>He said: "But the man of God did not say the controversy was about a child".
    <br>I said: "Do you want him to explain everything when you have already told him that you don't have a first wife?"
    <br>I understand what is happening and we have been watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>for a long time, that the man of God speaks in parables.
    <br>He had spoken it and it was all about this child.
    <br>I went and met the girl.
    <br>That day I met the girl, something spoke to my heart that the whole thing had come to an end.
    <br>Something told me that she was the daughter.
    <br>I held her and she was crying that: "So, I have a wonderful mum like this".
    <br>She held onto me and since that day, we have been talking; I kept calling her.
    <br>I try to show her love and today, everything has come to pass that this family has been united -
    <br>she has met her dad and the dad has met his daughter.
    <br>I called my daughter when I got home that day.
    <br>I said: "We have another 'Ada' somewhere."
    <br>She said: "How can it be?"
    <br>I said: "Daddy has another 'Ada' (first daughter) somewhere; that means you are no longer 'Ada'."
    <br>She said: "If daddy is truly the person who had the child, I don't have to argue about it;
    <br>she remains 'Ada' I am 'sister humble'."
    <br>We laughed.
    <br>Today, I know that when my children meet them, they will be glad
    <br>because they are all part of the Emmanuel TV family.
    <br>We are all happy to witness this happening today in our lives.
    <br>We accept you with our whole hearts and everything is yours.
    <br>My wonderful grandchildren – I am ready to serve these children from today.
    <br>Today is a new day in my life and family.
    <br>I am so happy about what the man of God is doing in this place.
    <br>I am a staunch follower of T.B. Joshua and I will continue to follow him 'til the end of the world.
    <br>It is certain that nothing can separate us.
    <br>I am very happy today and pray that as we reunite today, this family will remain in unity,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As God continues to use T.B. Joshua to do the work of charity and humanity,
    <br>the Lord will continue to empower him and refresh him the more.
    <br>I pray that God will build this church and the gates of hell shall not prevail, in the name of Jesus Christ!
