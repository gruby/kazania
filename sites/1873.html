    <br>I am Angel Gomes, I am 16 years old and I play for Manchester United and England.
    <br>I need career breakthrough at the moment.
    <br>I have a lot of injuries around my groin, hip and ankle
    <br>and I need the man of God to help me with these injuries.
    <br>Please, man of God, help me!
    <br>Man of God, please, help me!
    <br>I have problems with my groin and hip and an ankle ligament injury.
    <br>Man of God, please, help me!
    <br>We just heard now from a professional footballer who is here today.
    <br>He is playing for Manchester United in the Youth Academy,
    <br>and he has come because he is having severe injuries in his groin, hip and ankle.
    <br>He has come to seek the face of God.
    <br>That was the young man we just heard from, and by the grace of God he is going to receive prayer.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank you, man of God. Thank you, Jesus. 
    <br>Thank you, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I can move my legs!
    <br>I can move my ankle!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Angel Gomes, I am from Manchester and I am 16 years old.
    <br>I play for Manchester United Football Club.
    <br>I had been really struggling with injuries.
    <br>I also represent the England National Team at the under-17 level as Captain.
    <br>I was having injuries around my hip and groin which had affected me playing
    <br>and also I suffered an ankle injury not long ago which had affected me playing
    <br>and kept me out for a long time.
    <br>At what time would these injuries come?
    <br>Would they be coming at very important times in your career as a professional footballer?
    <br>Yes, these injuries would come at hard times for me - times when I was having a breakthrough
    <br>or times when I had to go to a tournament or play in games.
    <br>These injuries would happen quite frequently.
    <br>I have known about The SCOAN for a long time as my family follow Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My parents are big fans and we always watch videos.
    <br>We thought that it would be a good time and chance for me to come and be touched by the prophet.
    <br>First of all, what was your experience in the Service today before the prophet came and prayed for you?
    <br>I was quite amazed. I was watching carefully, watching everyone.
    <br>It touched me really because it's different watching it at home on TV
    <br>and to actually be here and watch it live was a great experience for me.
    <br>During the Service, we saw Prophet T.B. Joshua came and prayed for you.
    <br>Can you describe what happened when he prayed for you?
    <br>I felt something inside me, like a little shock.
    <br>I was surprised and can't really describe how I felt.
    <br>It's just all coming to me now really.
    <br>We can see on the screen what happened when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for our brother.
    <br>Immediately after the prayer, what are the changes you have instantly observed in your body?
    <br>My legs are feeling a lot stronger now.
    <br>The pain in my hip and groin has gone and the pain in my ankle has gone too.
    <br>Hallelujah, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Could you, for the glory of God, just exercise your body and show us how you are feeling now,
    <br>things that you can do that you couldn't do before?
    <br>Angel Gomes
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Hallelujah, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for the life of our brother.
    <br>What is your word of advice to people around the world,
    <br>now that you have come here yourself and experienced God's power?
    <br>Don't doubt what you are feeling inside.
    <br>Just go with your heart really and have faith.
    <br>When you need someone to look to, just look to God.
    <br>Just have faith and be proud.
    <br>This is my older sister Gloria, who travelled with me.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Gloria and we travelled from Manchester, England.
    <br>This is my brother, Angel.
    <br>I just came with him, to follow him here.
    <br>What can you say about what happened to him here in the Service, and what God Almighty has done for him?
    <br>I would say that it was absolutely amazing - exactly what we expected.
    <br>We came here for healing and I believe that he has received it, in Jesus' name
    <br>through Prophet T.B. Joshua, and we would like to thank you all for everything.
    <br>Thank God; one more time, people of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let's watch what happened to Angel Gomes after his encounter with our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
    <br>at The SCOAN prayer line.
    <br>To God be the glory! Jesus Christ, the Master Healer has done it again!
    <br>There are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus Christ!"
