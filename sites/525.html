    <br>You have seen and you have heard the Words of wisdom.
    <br>This is a Word of faith;
    <br>it will open your career, your future, your past and reconcile them.
    <br>I say, I reconcile your present and your future!
    <br>I reconcile your past and your present, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Do you know what I mean when I say your past and present have been reconciled?
    <br>It means nothing in the past can hold you.
    <br>Your past cannot affect your present and your future.
    <br>Whatever spirit in your past that is hindering your present and future, be broken!
    <br>Listen,
    <br>whatever spirit -
    <br>What I mean by spirit -
    <br>those setbacks,
    <br>those sicknesses.
    <br>Because your present is secure.
    <br>Right now as I am talking, you are in the presence of God.
    <br>Whatever spirit in your past,
    <br>the spirit of infirmity,
    <br>affliction,
    <br>setback,
    <br>sickness, disease
    <br>failure,
    <br>hardship -
    <br>whatever spirit that is hindering your present and your future, be broken!
    <br>I command them out!
    <br>Rise up and begin to command that spirit.
    <br>Whatever spirit that is hindering your present and your future -
    <br>the spirit of your past...
    <br>ENTER The REALM Of LIBERATION!!! | TB Joshua Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Those spirits in the past are not good spirits
    <br>because your past is behind you,
    <br>your present is beside you,
    <br>and your future is before you.
    <br>Say, "Those spirits
    <br>that are hindering my present
    <br>and my future".
    <br>Break them!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet TB Joshua - touch the screen by faith, in Jesus' name!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Right now, confess your freedom!
    <br>Confess your freedom!
    <br>Old things pass away;
    <br>every other thing becomes new.
    <br>My business is new,
    <br>my career is new,
    <br>my finances are new,
    <br>my marriage is new,
    <br>my destiny is new!
    <br>Is new!
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>My career - good morning!
    <br>My finances - good morning!
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>My marriage - good morning!
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When we are in the presence of God,
    <br>like what you are seeing happen,
    <br>we are in the realm -
    <br>that is where we can offer prayer.
    <br>You don't just meet the man of God, "TB Joshua pray for me", and begin to pray. No.
    <br>Unless he is in that realm.
    <br>God releases me to the realm -
    <br>that is why I can see beyond human comprehension.
    <br>When I am there, I should flow along with you;
    <br>I carry you along to that realm.
    <br>I am telling you, it is all over!
    <br>Yes, I am in the liberation realm -
    <br>that is why I carry you along
    <br>and I deliver you all.
    <br>Your life will not remain the same!
    <br>I mean, your career will not remain the same!
    <br>I mean, your finances,
    <br>your business are not the same any longer.
    <br>Old things pass away;
    <br>every other thing becomes new.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I know you really enjoyed the move of God today.
