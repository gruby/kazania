    418 - T.B. Joshua Speaks On JOB CREATION!
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not a God created
    <br>By human hands
    <br>You are not a God dependent
    <br>On any mortal man
    <br>You are not a God in need of
    <br>Anything we can give
    <br>By Your plan that's just the way it is
    <br>You are not a God created
    <br>By human hands
    <br>You are not a God dependent

    <br>You are not a God in need of
    <br>Anything we can give

    <br>You were on Your throne
    <br>You are God alone
    <br>And right now in the good times and bad
    <br>You are on Your throne
    <br>You are God alone
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You're the only God whose power
    <br>None can contend
    <br>You're the only God whose name and
    <br>Praise will never end
    <br>You're the only God who's worthy
    <br>Of everything we can give
    <br>You are God that's just the way it is
    <br>You are God alone
    <br>From before time began
    <br>You were on Your throne
    <br>You are God alone
    <br>And right now in the good times and bad
    <br>You are on Your throne
    <br>You are God alone
    <br>You're unchangeable
    <br>Unshakeable
    <br>Unstoppable
    <br>That's who You are
    <br>You're unchangeable
    <br>Unshakeable
    <br>Unstoppable
    <br>That's who you are
    <br>You are God alone

    <br>You're unshakeable
    <br>You're unstoppable
    <br>That's who You are
    <br>You're unchangeable
    <br>Unshakeable
    <br>Unstoppable
    <br>That's who You are
    <br>You're unchangeable
    <br>You're unshakeable
    <br>Unstoppable
    <br>That's who You are
    <br>Hallelujah. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Bless you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with you...
    <br>[Who can be against you?]
    <br>I?
    <br>Your nation?
    <br>All over the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I know God blessed you with the message you have received and the testimonies.
    <br>When the door of your heart is open, what else again? We just enter, you receive.
    <br>I know you are ready.
    <br>I can't see your hand.
    <br>I'm ready because all what I have been seeing has ushered me to the presence of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>All I have been seeing since the beginning of this service
    <br>has ushered me to His presence.
    <br>In His presence, where I'm strong...
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are in His presence now.
    <br>You are filled, you are fire.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I will pray for you, you will pray for me.
    <br>You know that?
    <br>When I'm praying for you, you are praying for me.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>You may not know this.
    <br>If you didn't know this, it is better you know it now.
    <br>When I'm praying for you, you are praying for me.
    <br>You just believe that it is only a pastor that can pray for you - no.
    <br>As I'm talking to you now, you talk to me.
    <br>Are you talking to me in the spirit?
    <br>Let me hear what you are saying.
    <br>Can I hear...?
    <br>- What are you saying?
    <br>- May God bless you.
    <br>You are saying it now?
    <br>Viewers all over the world, what are you saying?
    <br>I'm talking to you, you talk to me.
    <br>It is not one-way.
    <br>I'm talking to you, you talk to me.
    <br>Don't just sit down and look at me.
    <br>If you are looking at me, you may be tempted.
    <br>You just have to...
    <br>"I talk to you, you talk to me" - that is how to grow.
    <br>If you want to grow; as I'm talking now, you begin to talk in your spirit.
    <br>You will now begin to say, "Look at the grammar - it is not correct".
    <br>When you are not talking and you are just looking at me talking,
    <br>there is a tendency for you to say, "That English is not correct".
    <br>That is temptation.
    <br>When you talk to me, you will be so occupied that you will see only what God wants you to hear.
    <br>But when you are not talking to me, I'm just talking to you, you say,
    <br>"Look, he is a small boy. He will turn right now - what does it mean?"
    <br>That is not what you are here for.
    <br>Talk to me and I will talk to you.
    <br>When I talk to you, you talk to me - you cannot be tempted.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As I'm talking, you talk...
    <br>But when you remain silent, you look at me, "OK. This is what they say about him.
    <br>He goes this way, that way. How many times did he mention the name Jesus?
    <br>One, two, three, four; four times. OK, let's watch.
    <br>He turned back again. Look at the way he turns."
    <br>How do you want me to turn?
    <br>Tell me, how do you want me to turn?
    <br>You want me to turn the way you turn.
    <br>You are sitting down, I'm standing - I can turn.
    <br>If you stand up like me, you too will turn like I am turning.
    <br>"Look at him, he is going this way. He turned again. Look at this man."
    <br>Talk to me.
    <br>Are you talking to me in your spirit?
    <br>What are you saying?
    <br>- You say what?
    <br>- [God bless you.]
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Not only here - when the ministers of God minister in your church and you are sitting down,
    <br>don't just sit down and look at them - it is not right.
    <br>You are giving room for temptation.
    <br>When the minister is talking, you talk in your spirit.
    <br>As you are talking in the spirit, there will be revelation.
    <br>If the minister is saying something that is from God - OK,
    <br>but if you know he says something not of God, you can rebuke him in your spirit.
    <br>It is either you bless him or rebuke him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the same vein, when you are watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>as you see things happen - talk...
    <br>When they say "Amen", you say, "Amen".
    <br>If they heal someone - agree, you are the one they healed.
    <br>If they bless someone and you are watching on Emmanuel TV -
    <br>oK, it is you that is blessed.
    <br>If there is a prophecy concerning somebody and it is similar to the situation you are facing -
    <br>say, "Amen", and it will happen to you immediately.
    <br>Don't just sit down and begin to say, "How does he see this thing?"
    <br>Those are temptations.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have received, your spirit is high, and the door of your heart is open.
    <br>You have seen God's Word working in the Spirit.
    <br>If you have seen, let me see...
    <br>How God's Word is working in the Spirit.
    <br>How the Spirit of God destroys the work of evil.
    <br>Are you talking of the anointing of God...
    <br>What a wonderful name - "Jesus".
    <br>You hear "Jesus" at the prayer line; people begin to confess.
    <br>"Jesus!" - people are healed,
    <br>"Jesus!" - people are delivered.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>Bless His name.
    <br>Bless His holy name.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We have received so many emails, text messages,
    <br>"T.B. Joshua, why are you talking about job creation? You are a prophet - we know."
    <br>They know - maybe I have seen something, a revelation.
    <br>I talk about job creation because it is a revelation I've seen.
    <br>It is as the result of the vision I saw some years ago.
    <br>Every day visions keep coming.
    <br>They say, "You are a minister of God - you are so much concerned about job creation".
    <br>Yes - because of the vision.
    <br>LET US CARE FOR OUR YOUTH
    <br>This is a way to arrest the coming ominous sign.
    <br>To arrest the coming of what? - Ominous sign.
    <br>There is danger.
    <br>There will be revolution.
    <br>The revolution is coming.
    <br>When the young ones will take to the streets
    <br>because of the so-called "legacy"...
    <br>Take note of that - the so-called "legacy" (education)
    <br>we give them, will not have meaning.
    <br>No jobs, no education.
    <br>Unemployment has made education useless,
    <br>in the sense that the young ones today see no meaning in going to school
    <br>because where there is no job, there is no eduction.
    <br>This has affected the value of education.
    <br>Graduates struggle with the uneducated for "unskilled job".
    <br>When you call for a driver, security, gardener, you will see graduates,
    <br>master degree, PhD holders and uneducated compete for the same job,
    <br>running, rushing out for the job.
    <br>And at the end of the day, the uneducated will be given the job because they have what it takes.
    <br>They have thorough experience of the job.
    <br>When you were schooling, you spent 10 years in the school,
    <br>they were out there - experience is the best teacher.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Education and jobs are synonymous.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Education and jobs are synonymous.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Education and jobs are synonymous.]
    <br>Education and jobs are synonymous.
    <br>No education, no job; no job, no education.
    <br>Revolution.
    <br>The so-called legacy, 'education' you give your children - young ones -
    <br>they have graduated - will not have meaning because no job, no education.
    <br>LET US CARE FOR OUR YOUTH
    <br>Those who are in a college, university now, brilliant ones,
    <br>each time they remember those who came out with first class and good grades
    <br>that are on the streets doing what they are not trained to do,
    <br>it affects their moral.
    <br>Revolution is coming, if we don't act now,
    <br>when the young ones will take to the streets.
    <br>The part-time school, university - it is for working-class people and the elders,
    <br>but today the youth have taken over the part-time universities
    <br>because they can't give their full time to education because they realise,
    <br>"Can we give all to what is of low value?"
    <br>You see young ones that are supposed to go to university going for part-time.
    <br>Part-time is for working-class people and elders, but youth have taken over.
    <br>Can we give all to what is of no value?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sanitation workers after the service will clean all the surroundings of the church
    <br>and they will see different things but they will not see your money on the floor
    <br>because you know the value.
    <br>At the end of the service today, the sanitation workers will move around to clean the church.
    <br>They will discover different objects, things on the floor which you abandoned
    <br>but they will never come out with a penny because you know the value of your money.
    <br>Can we continue to keep what is of less value?
    <br>Take note: Can you continue to keep what is of less value?
    <br>Education and job are synonymous.
    <br>I will leave you here. 
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>LET US CARE FOR OUR YOUTH
    <br>Revolution is coming.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Revolution is coming when the young ones will take to the streets".
    <br>The so-called legacy, education we give them will not have meaning.
    <br>No job, no education.
    <br>Unemployment has made education useless,
    <br>in the sense that the young ones see no meaning in going to school,
    <br>because no education - no job, no job - no education.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have some guests in our midst.
    <br>I know we have opportunity to call them to address us.
    <br>Before that, we have twenty-two graduates that have been given jobs.
    <br>They are coming out to give thanks to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We will also use this opportunity to...
    <br>A million thanks are not enough for the viewers all over the world.
    <br>Like I have told you - love is the greatest.
    <br>Fifty percent of people that provided these jobs are people of other faith.
    <br>This is to tell you - love your neighbour.
    <br>Your neighbour could be your enemy,
    <br>those who do not share the same faith with you - love them.
    <br>Twenty Two Graduates Offered Employment Through
    <br>The SCOAN Job Creation Project
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They are twenty-two graduates - they were offered employment already.
    <br>After their testimony they are going back to their job.
    <br>Twenty Two Graduates Offered Employment Through
    <br>The SCOAN Job Creation Project
    <br>Every day we keep receiving thousands of emails from all over the world;
    <br>Asian countries, Singapore, Indonesia, United States - people want to give jobs.
    <br>They say, "Man of God, we watch your channel, we really want to give jobs.
    <br>And we like the love you express to the world,
    <br>to let the world know that whatever name you bear is synonymous."
    <br>What matters?
    <br>The hope of glory.
    <br>Twenty Two Graduates Offered Employment Through
    <br>The SCOAN Job Creation Project
    <br>Let's just hear one or two words from them.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is  Henry Otutu.
    <br>I'm a member of Christ Embassy.
    <br>I'm a graduate from Ambrose Alli University.
    <br>Here we are, twenty-two of us.
    <br>We are here with our appointment letters.
    <br>I want to say thank you to the man of God and to the idea that that he has brought -
    <br>the job creation program.
    <br>I want to give my advice to the people of the world, to many youths out there that are unemployed.
    <br>I want to say: Hold on to God
    <br>because when you run out of rope, it is time to grab onto faith
    <br>and I pray God will see us through.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I want to believe you listened to the message,
    <br>that the names "Synagogue Church Of All Nations", "Christ Embassy" are just synonymous.
    <br>What matters is the righteousness of God.
    <br>This should not influence you to change your church.
    <br>Worship in your Christ Embassy.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Twenty Two Graduates Offered Employment Through
    <br>The SCOAN Job Creation Project
    <br>If you have any query concerning Synagogue or Christ Embassy, go to your Bible.
    <br>Bible is our standard.
    <br>Twenty Two Graduates Offered Employment Through
    <br>The SCOAN Job Creation Project
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with us, nobody can be against us.
    <br>My name is Anyin Theresa Atimanu, I'm from Cross River State.
    <br>I come from the hills in Nigeria.
    <br>I'm a graduate of agric from the University of Calabar.
    <br>I'm a Catholic.
    <br>I'm here to thank God and Emmanuel TV partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for the employment, for which he cried to the nations, to rescue the youths.
    <br>I stand here as a proud future of the nation Nigeria,
    <br>because twenty-two of us have been rescued.
    <br>Thank you very much for your love for Nigeria
    <br>and thank you once again for what you have done for us.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Like I have said:
    <br>Bible is our roadmap, our standard.
    <br>No matter the church where you worship, please take your time to study your Bible.
    <br>The Bible will tell you the church that is living and the church that is dead.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much - here is my appointment letter.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ogundaini Adeleke Timothy.
    <br>I am a graduate of industrial chemistry from the Federal University of Technology, Akure.
    <br>I am also a trained safety and environmental officer,
    <br>by the Nigerian Institute Of Safety Professionals.
    <br>By the grace of God, I am a member of this unshakeable ministry,
    <br>The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>I am one of the twenty-two graduates that are here today with our appointment letters.
    <br>We are here to rejoice in the Lord and to testify to His goodness,
    <br>for using the anointed one, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners -
    <br>for using them to rescue us from this joblessness.
    <br>By the grace of God, I am here with my appointment letter.
    <br>He is a true man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>How many of you have appointment letters now?
    <br>Twenty-two.
    <br>Out of twenty-two I think only one or two are members of The SCOAN.
    <br>When the whole thing was thrown open, when we spoke to the viewers all over the world,
    <br>after the service many people rushed down here the following day.
    <br>When thousand people turned up, I said, "Please, ladies and gentlemen,
    <br>I'm not interested in the name of your church for now."
    <br>After the screening and the selection you can tell us the church you belong.
    <br>The selection was done and I said the name of the church should not be mentioned.
    <br>Wherever you worship...
    <br>So far you are a human being down...
    <br>How many are from The Synagogue here?
    <br>We are just two.
    <br>Only two out of twenty-two.
    <br>Twenty Two Graduates Offered Employment Through
    <br>The SCOAN Job Creation Project
    <br>This is a church of all nations.
    <br>The word church - that is not the issue now.
    <br>The issue is love.
    <br>If you love your neighbour, you will be interested in his welfare.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[If you love your neighbour, you will be interested in his welfare.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[If you love your neighbour, you will be interested in his welfare.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[If you love your neighbour, you will be interested in his welfare.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[If you love your neighbour, you will be interested in his welfare.]
    <br>You will be interested in his welfare.
    <br>You will not say, "My neighbour, because you do not share the same faith with me, I will not give you food.
    <br>My neighbour, because you do not share the same faith with me, I will not give you clothes to wear.
    <br>My neighbour, because you do not share the same faith with me, I will not give you house.
    <br>My neighbour, because you do not share the same faith with me, I will not give you job."
    <br>That is not Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Love draws people to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Love is to draw people to God".
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Love is to draw people to God.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Love is to draw people to God.]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Love is to draw people to God.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Love is to draw people to God.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Love is to draw people to God.]
    <br>If you now say, "You don't share the same faith with me - go!",
    <br>your love has done what?
    <br>Brother, I say, "You don't share the same faith with me - I will not give you",
    <br>my love has done what?
    <br>It has driven you away.
    <br>Ask me to give you.
    <br>- Give me this.
    <br>- No, you don't share the same faith with me.
    <br>What has my love done?
    <br>It has driven you away and you go without food.
    <br>Say, "Give me this".
    <br>Give me this.
    <br>Whether you are this or not...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are talking of love that sees beyond hatred.
    <br>When they hated you, you loved them - that is the love I'm talking about.
    <br>Sit down, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ossai Benjamin.
    <br>I am a graduate from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka; I read computer science.
    <br>I'm a Catholic.
    <br>I'm here to return all glory to God for what He has used the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV partners to do in our lives.
    <br>We have been seeking for a job and now we have found it.
    <br>In our hands you can see the evidence, which is our appointment letter.
    <br>Thank you so much, Man of God.
    <br>And for the viewers all over the world: I want to let you know
    <br>that here is the arena of liberty.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>And at the same time; when you do this to God, what happens?
    <br>The people and the person God has given the grace to do this;
    <br>I have now become a partner in prayer with them.
    <br>You know what it means when I say I'm a partner in prayer with you?
    <br>It means where you take this blessing and give to these graduates -
    <br>the strength you have to give that job - where you give that job, it will prosper.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, I want to honourably introduce our mum.
    <br>I am Mrs Sina Chuma-Mkandawire.
    <br>I am the Director and Representative of the International Labour Organization, UN Agency,
    <br>which is based in Nigeria, covering Nigeria, Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
    <br>and it serves as the Liaison Office for ECOWAS.
    <br>It is an exclusive privilege for me to stand before you and the whole world
    <br>and I thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua for this undeserved honour.
    <br>Hosea 4:6 says, "My people perish for lack of knowledge".
    <br>Youth unemployment is a huge challenge that the world is facing today
    <br>and we commend the efforts of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV for championing a world wide initiative on job creation.
    <br>As this challenge needs the concerted efforts of governments, the private sector,
    <br>individuals, institutions, and indeed faith-based organisations,
    <br>we stand ready to support this initiative.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The ILO is the oldest agency of the UN, established in 1919.
    <br>In 1944, through the Philadelphia declaration, the ILO's purpose was redefined
    <br>following the economic depression of 1932-1934.
    <br>The declaration embodies the fact that labour is not a commodity
    <br>but it should be accorded the dignity it deserves.
    <br>Freedom of expression and association are essential to sustained progress.
    <br>The declaration also said poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere
    <br>and most importantly all human beings, irrespective of race, creed, or sex
    <br>have the right to pursue both their material well-being and their spiritual development
    <br>in conditions of freedom and dignity,
    <br>of economic security and equal opportunity.
    <br>We also believe in the ILO that all jobs created must be decent jobs.
    <br>My organization is best on the respect for all people and all religions and faith.
    <br>This is where there is a convergence with what is happening here today.
    <br>And we are there to join the efforts of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and all faith-based organisations in their promotion and creation of jobs.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The man of God's efforts and dividends of good forecast planning and the vision
    <br>will surely bring about a revolution on job creation.
    <br>Not only will the man of God's initiative forecast on jobs already on the offer,
    <br>but we will work together and bring our expertise and those of others on board
    <br>to ensure that young people and other job seekers are provided with the right skills and knowledge
    <br>to start their own businesses
    <br>and be the employers of the abundant talents that are available worldwide.
    <br>This initiative will also bring forth innovative ways of creating "green jobs",
    <br>as the world tackles and deals with climate change.
    <br>Because there is a divine hand behind this initiative, it shall receive divine success, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The Christian life is one of faith and sacrifice
    <br>and we see it in the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua's job creation initiative.
    <br>I urge all viewers, all of over the world to listen to The SCOAN's message, which is titled,
    <br>"We need one another".
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV always place importance on the unity of the church
    <br>and the people as the centre of all human endeavours and development.
    <br>The messages contained in what I said earlier, "We need one another" and "Unity of the church",
    <br>are all loaded with wisdom of how we can work together for the good of mankind.
    <br>The ILO, in collaboration with The SCOAN, are currently working on a website
    <br>for employers and job seekers,
    <br>where jobs that already have been offered will be posted
    <br>and job seekers will have access to those jobs and can apply online.
    <br>Now, that the youth and the other job seekers will have access to the knowledge
    <br>of where jobs and self-employment opportunities are,
    <br>they shall not perish, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, good, report on them.
    <br>If there be any virtue, praise, think on these things.
    <br>I end with that verse from Philippians 4:8.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you, daddy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Well, you have listened to that.
    <br>I was very very happy today when I was reading through the newspaper,
    <br>when my president and finance minister were saying job creation is giving them sleepless nights.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, it means this is what they want to do now.
    <br>It is giving them sleepless nights - this means this is what they are bound to do now.
    <br>They realise that is the answer and the way forward.
    <br>When you watch international news, you will see the world powers - G8.
    <br>They came together of recent.
    <br>Their primary discussion was job creation for the youth.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us rise up and pray.
    <br>Ask God to give them strength and enablement and to redeem the whole world.
    <br>As the news is going on, God says something, and God says...
    <br>Let this go into their hearts and we are waiting for accomplishment,
    <br>the day we will say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Prayer, to the whole world, to the United Nations,
    <br>as a body that brings all nations together.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Oh Lord, redeem the nations. Redeem the world.
    <br>We commit the United Nations into Your hands.
    <br>Guide them and inspire them, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we also want to say thank you.
    <br>You have listened, you have seen that...
    <br>We only talk but the job is done.
    <br>We cannot go it alone.
    <br>So, we are going to hand over this, as you send your emails and those whom you want to employ.
    <br>We have received thousands...
    <br>You have listened to the body, which is the greatest body as far as the world is concerned.
    <br>So, we hand over to them - they do justice to it.
    <br>The issue is not, "I'm a Muslim. I'm a Christian" - no.
    <br>We want to see that the food is on your table.
    <br>And then we pray.
    <br>Jesus will give us the grace to get it to the end, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let us care for our youth".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Let us care for our youth.]
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Can we listen to just one or two people's testimonies?
