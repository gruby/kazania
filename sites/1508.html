    <br>Paraguay
    <br>Good evening. My name is Ever Palacios. I am 39 years old and I am from Paraguay.
    <br>I came to the crusade in desperate need for healing due to chronic back pain.
    <br>I also had cysts in my wrist.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay

    <br>Due to the back problem, I lost my job because I spent three months going in and out of hospital
    <br>where many tests were conducted.

    <br>Because of the excruciating pain, I lost my job and was limited in carrying out my daily activities.
    <br>I also had severe pain on my back and wrist.
    <br>I couldn't play drums in church.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I had to use a lumbar corset, strong medication and a wrist brace to relieve me of the pain.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I got to the prayer line, I had hope that Jesus would heal me through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua walked up to me and touched my forehead.

    <br>At that moment, I lost strength and fell down.
    <br>When I stood up, strength returned to my whole body.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I ran a distance of 1,400 meters through the park to prove that I am healed.
    <br>Before, I could neither jump nor move but now I can jump, in the name of Jesus.

    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset
    <br>Like an athlete, he runs down the road and begins to exercise his body to the glory of God.
    <br>Yes, Jesus Christ has set him totally free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>All glory to Him.
    <br>My advice to everyone is to believe that there is Someone greater than what we can imagine -
    <br>His name is Jesus.

    <br>The person next to me is my wife. Her name is Justina González.

    <br>Good Morning, Emmanuel TV!
    <br>My name is Justina González and I'm from Paraguay.
    <br>What can you tell us about your husband's healing?

    <br>Really, what the Lord has done for us is amazing.
