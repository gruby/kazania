    <br>Get ready to pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and catch the fire to cross the bridge into 2014 - the year of glory, the year of destiny,
    <br>the year of crossing the bridge
    <br>Catch the fire.
    <br>Viewers, catch the fire
    <br>to cross the bridge.
    <br>This is the year of glory, the year of destiny.
    <br>I don't know the situation you are facing; Jesus knows.
    <br>No matter the difficulty or the situation that you are in over there -
    <br>are you on the sick bed?
    <br>Whatever name they call that sickness,
    <br>nothing can change your destiny!
    <br>Viewers what can separate you?
    <br>Can that sickness separate you?
    <br>Can affliction separate you?
    <br>Can Infirmity separate you?
    <br>Nothing can separate you.
    <br>Viewers at home, I command your dream of many years -
    <br>come true!
    <br>Dream of breakthrough - come true!
    <br>Dream of good health - come true!
    <br>Dream of prosperity - come to fulfilment!
    <br>Dream of long life - come true!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus’ Name
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>You have discovered yourself.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
