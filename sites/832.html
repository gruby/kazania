    <br>Good morning, church!
    <br>[Good morning.]
    <br>ACTING ON THE WORD
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Acting on the Word demands for believing and believing demands action – creates action.
    <br>It is not just mental assent.
    <br>It does not just admire or admit without acting upon it.
    <br>Action!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, it is time to bring Jesus one the scene.
    <br>The direction to follow - you have seen it all.
    <br>How do we bring Jesus on the scene?
    <br>When you say, "In Jesus' name" and Jesus would just come.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, “How do we bring Jesus on the scene?”
    <br>[How do we bring Jesus on the scene?]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[How do we bring Jesus on the scene?]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[How do we bring Jesus on the scene?]
    <br>How do we bring Jesus on the scene?
    <br>There are many: "be healed, be delivered, amen" but Jesus is not there.
    <br>You are just saying words.
    <br>There is a difference between praying prayer and saying words.
    <br>There is a difference between what?
    <br>Praying prayer and saying words.
    <br>Acting on the Word is letting Christ act through you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Acting on the Word is letting Christ act through you.]
    <br>I mean, acting on the Word then gives Christ an opportunity to heal, deliver and set you free.
    <br>Action!
    <br>He is looking for an opportunity to eat with you, talk to you, greet you; "How are you?", to touch you,
    <br>to live with you - just an opportunity.
    <br>By acting on the Word then gives Christ an opportunity.
    <br>By looking into the Word and acting on it will bring Christ on the scene.
    <br>The problem of believing is made easy when you know that it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>Repeat after me.
    <br>The problem of believing is made easy when you know that it is acting on what God has spoken -
    <br>very very...
    <br>it is made simple.
    <br>Faith is perfected by our acting on the Word.
    <br>The problem of believing is made very simple when you know that it is acting on what Jesus has spoken.
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal -
    <br>just act on those things - the commandments.
    <br>It is so simple, when you know that it is acting on what He has spoken.
    <br>You will be talking about me but you cannot behave like me.
    <br>If you are saying, "T.B. Joshua is this and that" - this is all you know about me.
    <br>But what of my behavior?
    <br>I can run - can you run?
    <br>I can laugh - will you also laugh?
    <br>I can dance - can you dance?
    <br>T.B. Joshua can run - can you run?
    <br>If you cannot run - you do not know T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is the problem we are having in our faith today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Action!"
    <br>[Action!]
    <br>Believing demands action – creates action.
    <br>That is believing.
    <br>We are hearers but not doers.
    <br>Since you are a hearer, you just have sense knowledge – mental assent.
    <br>Being just a hearer and not a doer – if there is anything you have faith in, it is in man;
    <br>what man has done – science, works and organization.
    <br>These are the things you can have faith in - not in God.
    <br>To have faith in God, you must be a doer of the Word.
    <br>If you are a doer, you have faith in God
    <br>but if you are just a hearer of the Word, if there is anything you have faith in,
    <br>is in man – what man has done, science, works and organization and more.
    <br>These are the things you can have faith in because you are not a doer of the Word.
    <br>That is why you can build a big beautiful church, you can organize things, you are a good organizer,
    <br>you can plan an organization or church, you can build a big building...
    <br>Science - yes, you can make things happen just like that.
    <br>These are man's natural gifts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This does not necessarily demand for an obedience to God to be endowed naturally.
    <br>You learn, you study, you pay the price.
    <br>Can you see now why it is difficult for you to have faith in God?
    <br>You hear and study the Word of God, you commit it to memory, not in your heart.
    <br>If there is anything you have faith in - it is in what man has done.
    <br>These are the things you have faith in because you are a hearer and not a doer.
    <br>That is "a sense knowledge, mental assent" which I describe as
    <br>"admires, admits but does not act on the Word".
    <br>I admire your look, you look good.
    <br>That does not mean I can die for you.
    <br>There is an extent I can go...
    <br>These are the reasons you look at the appearance when you want to marry.
    <br>The man is rich, looks handsome, the lady looks beautiful - they have some outward qualities.
    <br>This is mental assent.
    <br>If you go now “by believing” to marry somebody and carry God along, you demand for action,
    <br>create an action - and this must come from your heart.
    <br>The Bible says that what does not come from the heart is a sin.
    <br>Action must come from your heart.
    <br>Heart.
    <br>The love of the heart is love of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “I have found the secret”.
    <br>[I have found the secret.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[I have found the secret.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[I have found the secret.]
    <br>Let the Word be loosed in you, let the Word dominate you,
    <br>let the Word rule you, let the Word live in you.
    <br>These are the secrets.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have found the secret.
    <br>Let the Word rule you, let the Word be loosed in you, let the Word dominate you, let the Word live in you -
    <br>These are the secrets of bringing Jesus on the scene.
    <br>The secret of bringing what?
    <br>[These are the secrets of bringing Jesus on the scene.]
    <br>Each time you call, "Jesus!" - people around would hear you, you would hear yourself but Jesus does not what?
    <br>[Hear you.]
    <br>Does not hear you - that is very frustrating.
    <br>This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva; when Jesus could not hear them - what happened?
    <br>The demon jumped on them and said, "Paul I know, Jesus I know; but who are you?"
    <br>They started beating them.
    <br>If Jesus heard them Jesus would be there to act for them, to defend them, to protect them.
    <br>OK, take your pen and write,
    <br>“The secret of bringing Jesus on the scene, I have found it today.”
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>I have found the secret, the secret of bringing Jesus on the scene:
    <br>Let the Word be loosed in you, let the Word dominate you, let the Word rule you, let the Word live in you.
    <br>That is the secret.
    <br>That is just the secret.
    <br>Loose is  l o o s e.
    <br>Once you have this; you will be eating with Jesus...
    <br>When you say "Jesus!", 
    <br>He will reply, "What do you want?"
    <br>You would say, "Be healed!"
    <br>You say, "Jesus!", He would reply, 
    <br>"- What do you want?
    <br>- I want you to come sleep with me.
    <br>- OK, don't worry. Give me another pillow."
    <br>[Hallelujah]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can see the reason why you are just calling yourself every day instead of Jesus.
    <br>If you don’t give, you don’t receive.
    <br>In this case now, you have to give to receive; not money – your quality time, strength and love.
    <br>You must give your quality time to the Word of God, your quality love to the Word of God.
    <br>If you were not here but at home - where can you go?
    <br>Can you go to work today?
    <br>Can you go to the bank?
    <br>Today is not your quality time.
    <br>You know what I'm talking about.
    <br>Today is not your quality time.
    <br>Your quality time is when you are in between a billion dollars...
    <br>Here is prayer and somebody is calling you, 
    <br>"- Hey, come and receive this.
    <br>- No, I want to pray. When I finish the prayer I will come.
    <br>- If you come after prayer you will miss the money.
    <br>- OK, let me miss the money. Let me pray first."
    <br>How many of us can do that?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Choice can be the greatest gift you have.
    <br>There are many of us today that were supposed to be here and I can see that one or two them are not around.
    <br>By the time you meet them, they will say that while they were coming to the church they received a phone call
    <br>that their dear one was in coma.
    <br>It is a time for a choice now.
    <br>Would you choose to go to your dear one that is in coma or come to God?
    <br>Who is the Creator of the one that is in coma?
    <br>God is not one of those things, He is the Only one.
    <br>Even your coming here can revive the one in coma.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don't put God where God belongs - that is the problem you are having now.
    <br>In the house of many of us - we don't have an altar.
    <br>You are leaving the church now, you get back home; the morning water you received - you take it there.
    <br>Your Bible, your booklet you received you place it there.
    <br>Before you enter your room or any other place, you go straight to the altar -
    <br>you go on your knees at the table of your altar -
    <br>you place everything you have received today (morning water...) on the table with your Bible
    <br>and give thanks to God for giving you the grace to come back home.
    <br>It is like you believe that Angels of God have followed from here; you take them back to your altar
    <br>to stay there for you - when you are going home...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you just get home to your sitting room, bedroom you hang your clothes - "where is my food?"
    <br>You don't have an altar.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sometimes, you just have a revelation that you want to fast and pray today
    <br>and you will only be at the altar there that day.
    <br>You tell your family, "I'm there" - you just lay down there and pray.
    <br>An altar should be a place where you should give the highest regard to God.
    <br>We see God as one of those things... No - He is the only, not one of those things.
    <br>Don't restrict God with arrangements you make.
    <br>That is why it is difficult for me to wear an expensive watch.
    <br>Because I cannot "time" God.
    <br>If I have a watch I will not look at it when I am in the presence of God.
    <br>I will not "time" Him.
    <br>He should tell me when to start and when to finish, or when I should leave here.
    <br>I should not to begin to look at the watch, "oh, this is twelve o'clock..."
    <br>I don't "time" Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are the steps we are ignorantly taking and we say that we are serving God.
    <br>You are not serving God - it is God who is serving you.
    <br>Now, I’m looking at you; I can’t see anyone among you holding this.
    <br>While I'm talking I continue to "fire on" - and that is the purpose of it.
    <br>While I'm talking, you should also be in an attitude of prayer by saying,
    <br>"take more of me Lord, give me more of You."
    <br>If you cannot do that here, you will definitely forget about it at home while watching TV.
    <br>You should be "counting your faith" while watching TV.
    <br>You must get used to it.
    <br>You must cultivate the habit of building yourself – you need to build yourself.
    <br>When you build yourself, God will take it up -
    <br>God will take you somewhere and start building you
    <br>but you must first of all start building yourself before God can take it up and begin to build you.
    <br>God will not start building you from scratch.
    <br>Look at what happened to Peter  - I keep giving a good example of Peter.
    <br>When Peter wanted to meet Him on the sea, He said, "Come".
    <br>He said, "I want to come with You".
    <br>Jesus said, "Come. Take a step."
    <br>It was the step Peter took and was coming, and started to drown...
    <br>Finally, when he was about to disappear in the sea...
    <br>Jesus allowed him to test his faith.
    <br>Your faith needs to be tested.
    <br>A relationship must go through hard and good times before it can be mature
    <br>before it can be called a relationship.
    <br>If everything goes smoothly on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - I will not wait for Friday
    <br>before going on a fast and pray, "God I am sensing danger."
    <br>This world is not our home; we are only passing through it.
    <br>You are doing a business; big profits from Monday to Thursday - you know you are walking towards danger.
    <br>That profit - something is coming to destroy all the profit you made from Monday to Thursday.
    <br>You have to pause.
    <br>You may not even go to work on Friday because the profit is alarming.
    <br>Monday - profit, Tuesday - profit, Wednesday - profit, Thursday - profit; don't go to work on Friday.
    <br>Avoid what?
    <br>Avoid profit - tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Avoid profit.]
    <br>That profit may be dangerous.
    <br>Just avoid profit.
    <br>Say, "No. Lock the shop. Don't come to my shop and buy - no."
    <br>When someone comes to your shop asking, "Where is that gentleman?"
    <br>they would answer, "He is not around; the shop is not open today."
    <br>Yes, go fast and pray.
    <br>“In this world, there will be tribulation; cheer up, I have overcome for you!”
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you don't know you are in the world.
    <br>You don't know how the Bible describes that world to us - believers.
    <br>This world is not my home - sing it for them. 
    <br>Let them listen to that song.
    <br>This world is not my home
    <br>I’m just passing through
    <br>My treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon me
    <br>From Heaven’s open doors
    <br>And I can’t feel at home
    <br>In this world any more
    <br>This world is not my home
    <br>I’m just passing through
    <br>My treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon me
    <br>From Heaven’s open doors
    <br>And I can’t feel at home
    <br>In this world any more
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Crises, situations, if you are a Christian, are friends and not your enemies.
    <br>When you begin to see your situation as a friend, you will overcome it.
    <br>Because you know you are the cause of your situation, that is why you see it as an enemy but it is not.
    <br>They are meant to promote you.
    <br>The examination you are doing for promotion, are they enemies?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>That is the way, that is the life.
    <br>You have done a lot of examinations to be where you are today.
    <br>Examinations are not enemies; they are enemies when you are not prepared for them.
    <br>When the examination comes and you are not prepared, it becomes an enemy to you
    <br>but when you prepare for an examination, you pray, you are happy – it is your friend.
    <br>Everybody - people pray...
    <br>Those who want to be promoted pray for examination all the time because they want to be promoted.
    <br>When the examination comes and you pass, you’re promoted;
    <br>that is the situation to you, Christians.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your situations are friends; they are meant to promote you.
    <br>In the world, examination promotes when you pass
    <br>but in the spirit, you cannot remain stagnant; you need to be promoted.
    <br>The situation can be any type of situation; it depends on how it is designed - as it should be by divine will.
    <br>Your situation could be sickness, poverty, hardship, infirmity, disappointment.
    <br>Situations are meant for our spiritual benefit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Situations are meant for our spiritual benefit.]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They are meant for your spiritual benefit, for your spiritual growth.
    <br>Your situation could be this, could be that; sickness, disappointment...
    <br>When you sit down and you cannot define the cause of your situation...
    <br>All of us here that have a situation know the cause of your situation.
    <br>You know how many people you have duped in the past.
    <br>You know, out there how you met a spiritualist to collect concoction, charm
    <br>and dropped it on the seat of your boss, so that your boss can be removed,
    <br>so that you can take over the position.
    <br>You know how you decided to gang up against your boss and you took a report or petition
    <br>to the authority, lying against your boss.
    <br>At the end of the day the boss was fired.
    <br>You are promoted to the position.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know you are a drunkard; you can drink a lot of alcohol.
    <br>If there is a damage in your organs, don't call it spiritual benefit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not a spiritual benefit - it is to kill you; if God doesn't intervene.
    <br>I'm talking of...
    <br>When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and you renounce your past and follow Him,
    <br>whatever situation you are facing is for your spiritual benefit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Let's stand up and hear this.
    <br>The day you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, with all your heart –
    <br>when I say "with all your heart" I mean - you mean it.
    <br>You know - some of us, we don't mean what we are saying.
    <br>The day you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, with all your heart – you mean it
    <br>and you follow Him, whatever situation whatever challenges you will be facing
    <br>after accepting Jesus as your Lord and Saviour -
    <br>Jesus never said that when you accept Him, you will not face challenges,
    <br>this is why He said, “I pray your faith will not fail!”
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He was talking to His disciples and insisted, "I pray, your faith, Simon, will not fail."
    <br>It means that something is coming, that will challenge their faith.
    <br>What can challenge our faith?
    <br>Situations.
    <br>What can challenge our faith?
    <br>Satan.
    <br>What can challenge our faith?
    <br>Mess and stupid things – could be sickness, disease, disappointment, setback, infirmity.
    <br>"I pray your faith will not fail" - it means that something is coming that will challenge their faith,
    <br>that will make them say, "Will I continue to follow this man, or should I go back to the world?"
    <br>That is temptation, He was talking about.
    <br>The day you accept Him and you mean it with all your heart...
    <br>He never said that when you accept Him, you will not face tribulation, trouble and challenges.
    <br>There will be challenges; those challenges are meant for your spiritual benefit because you are not alone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am not alone".
    <br>[I am not alone.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[I am not alone.]
    <br>So, why are you afraid?
    <br>Why are you living as a Christian, as if there will no more be challenges or temptations?
    <br>There will be trouble and situations
    <br>but those situations, challenges and temptations are meant for your spiritual benefit.
    <br>Benefit means to promote you.
    <br>When you face a situation, you are not alone; after that situation, you are up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We Christians cannot pray for challenges.
    <br>We cannot just sit and begin to say, "Temptation should come."
    <br>It is something we could be demanding for because they are promotion.
    <br>You know the way you are looking for a promotion out there - you know.
    <br>Outside there you know how desperate you are to be promoted.
    <br>If it was possible, you would like to be promoted everyday.
    <br>If it is possible, everyday you want to seek for an examination.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to give you a key that will help your life.
    <br>Anytime you are facing a situation or challenges, it is time to honour Jesus before men.
    <br>Do you honour Him?
    <br>Look, I may be having pain here now - it is time to be happy before men.
    <br>I will be happy before men.
    <br>Anytime you are facing challenges of any kind, it is time to honour Jesus before who?
    <br>[Men.]
    <br>Before men.
    <br>It is only when you want a contract, you honour Jesus before men.
    <br>What satan wants for you when situations come – he wants you to be sad;
    <br>that is what he wants and that sadness is not permitted by the Holy Spirit
    <br>because the Holy Spirit wants a free spirit to operate.
    <br>Your spirit must be free and if our spirit is free, joy and happiness comes
    <br>but when you are not free, your spirit is not free and you are worried,
    <br>forget about it– that is not for the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is not allowed at that moment.
    <br>So, satan wants you to be sad all the time because he knows what it means to be sad;
    <br>to be sad is to be out of God; to be unhappy is to be out of God.
    <br>He knows that when you are sad, you are out of God
    <br>and he doesn’t want you to be with God, he wants you to be out of God.
    <br>When you are not happy, you are out of God.
    <br>That is why that situation will come.
    <br>When you are happy; suddenly you receive a phone call, "Do you know that this thing happened?"
    <br>Suddenly sadness comes.
    <br>The joy that was there before is gone.
    <br>Jesus is gone - satan enters.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus must be honoured 
    <br>Must be honoured must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured 
    <br>In my life every day
    <br>Jesus must be honoured 
    <br>Must be honoured must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured 
    <br>In my life every day
    <br>When you are not happy, you can’t make any good decision.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It means, you cannot pray and if you try to pray, you are praying to yourself -
    <br>people around you will hear you but God will not hear you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see the need to be happy and joyful even when there is nothing to be happy about;
    <br>you just have to be happy.
    <br>What satan wants to achieve is to take you out of God.
    <br>The moment you are not happy, you are out of God; he can attack you and have access to you.
    <br>The only time satan has access to you is when you are not happy.
    <br>When you are happy, satan cannot have access to you.
    <br>I am not saying, “Create happiness”.
    <br>You can create happiness when you go to beer parlour begin to drink, to smoke to be happy...
    <br>That is happiness you created by yourself.
    <br>Or you go to a party, begin to dance - you create that happiness; I am not talking about that happiness.
    <br>I am talking about a natural one that comes as a result of your deeds.
    <br>The medicine of your situation is happiness.
    <br>The happiness you had before your situation, don’t quit it.
    <br>When a situation comes, you can still hold on to your joy.
    <br>Quickly remember what the Bible says, “In this world, amidst that tribulation, cheer up!”
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Amidst - in the middle of that situation - that is the word, "cheer up".
    <br>C h e e r
    <br>In the middle, midst of that trouble, bad news, attack – you are inside that serious attack,
    <br>don’t forget, He said, “Cheer up! Be happy! That will make Me to have access to you”.
    <br>Because he wants to have access to you while you are in trouble
    <br>and to have access to you, you have to be happy in that trouble, so that He can come and rescue you.

    <br>These are the decisions we need to make when we follow Him.
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back no turning back
    <br>Someone is coming to know whether you mean it.
    <br>Someone came to God and asked Him, “Let me go to this man to know whether he means it.”
    <br>Satan came to God, "Please, allow me. I mean this man doesn't mean it. He said he follows - he doesn't mean it."
    <br>God answered, " - He means it.
    <br>- OK, allow me. Let me confirm whether he means it"
    <br>When he is coming to you, he can come with sickness, attack or whatever to show whether you mean it.
    <br>If you mean what you said.
    <br>If you mean it with all your heart, the more that attack, the more your desire for God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The more that temptation, the more your desire for God
    <br>but when you don’t mean it and the attack comes,
    <br>you will look back and begin to see Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>"Where I am coming from, there is nothing like this; I thought when I accept this man - no problem."
    <br>Take care of yourself; someone is coming to confirm whether you mean it
    <br>and he will not stop coming; his coming is to promote you if you mean it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you mean it, he is coming to promote you".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can't you hear what Paul said in the Book of Romans?
    <br>“What can separate me from the love of God?”
    <br>Because he meant it; he said it with all his heart.
    <br>Indeed, trouble and tribulation came; there was nothing that did not come to Paul
    <br>but the more those things, the more his desire for God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What can separate me from the love of Christ?
    <br>Can disease?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Can affliction?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Can poverty?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Can hardship?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Can death?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>What can separate me?
    <br>[Nothing.]
    <br>If you mean it!
    <br>You may be seated - thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The hardship in your nation, the attack on Christians or whatever cannot separate you from the love of God,
    <br>rather, it strengthens your desire.
    <br>What is holy is what we attack and what is dirty we don’t attack.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “What is holy, what is awesome, we attack.”
    <br>If you are not worth it, no-one will attack you.
    <br>There are many people on the street; they live on the street, they sleep on the street, they live under the bridge,
    <br>they sleep outside; nobody attacks them.
    <br>Attack on you is to show your potential, your value.
    <br>The more the attack the more your value.
    <br>If you are worth it, you deserve attack from those who are not worth it.
    <br>You can never envy someone who is below you but someone above you.
    <br>Do you still envy those who are below you?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Who are the people you envy?
    <br>Someone is also envying you and that envy can lead to attack; that envy can lead to death.
    <br>Therefore, you have decided to follow Jesus – meant it!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Mean it!"
    <br>[Mean it!]
    <br>Someone is coming to ask you, someone is coming to confirm – mean it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
