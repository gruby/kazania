    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>On the first Sunday of the year, January 3rd,
    <br>2016,
    <br>Prophet T.B.Joshua revealed a prophetic message
    <br>regarding the nation of North Korea.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>We have to pray for the President of North
    <br>Korea.
    <br>That was New Year's Eve, I said it.
    <br>I said, just pray for North Korea.
    <br>The reason why I am saying it - I am seeing
    <br>an arrow from there
    <br>and it will affect the world, if not a section
    <br>of the world.
    <br>An arrow from there.
    <br>So, let us live at peace because the war we are fighting already both in Syria and others is still there.
    <br>We cannot afford another one again.
    <br>It would end the whole world.
    <br>The whole world would be in confusion.
    <br>Because what I saw - there are some weapons
    <br>there the world does not know about.
    <br>If they throw that arrow, there will be confusion.
    <br>Remember, there is fight everywhere.
    <br>Adding this one to the fight, it means there
    <br>will be confusion all over the world.
