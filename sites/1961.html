  <p>    
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Energised by Christ and driven by the fire of the Holy Ghost, the apostles of God at The SCOAN
    <br>passionately intercede and raise prayer points during the Mass Prayer
    <br>in which thousands stand together in faith against the devil's schemes.
    <br>Because of Christ, satan has to listen and release every grip he may have once had in the lives of the people,
    <br>who vomit and release any evil substance that has been planted within them,
    <br>including blood and poisonous substances.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit at work here, pulling out evil deposits in people's lives.
    <br>Here is another lady being purged of the poison inside of her.
    <br>We can see a number of strange objects at her feet.
    <br>What could they possibly be?
    <br>These are cowries that have been vomited out of this lady.
    <br>Some would ask, 'What are shells, usually found in the sea, doing inside a human being?"
    <br>Others would explain that they are a sign of witchcraft activity.
    <br>Indeed, there is more to life than meets the ordinary eye.
    <br>Let us listen attentively as the lady herself speaks.
    <br>You can see what this woman vomited as the prayer was going on.
    <br>This is strange indeed; viewers out there, this is a woman who vomited out
    <br>these cowries we can see on the screen, along with poisonous substances.
    <br>It will be necessary for us to ask her how this came about.
    <br>What is she doing? How did this happen to her? Did she swallow these cowries, or how...?
    <br>Because this is mysterious.
    <br>So right now, we are going to listen to her.
    <br>Madam, tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Alhaja Bola, I am from Oyo state.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was the feeling that something was moving around in my body.
    <br>Last Sunday, I wanted to commit suicide because of the situation.
    <br>I could not succeed in any of my businesses and I owed a lot of people money.
    <br>How did this come about, having the cowries inside of you?
    <br>It might be from my childhood because this problem had been happening since I was growing up.
    <br>I did not live with my mother; I lived with someone who trained me.
    <br>It might be from my childhood or when I was growing up.
    <br>It might have been placed in my food.
    <br>But what I know is that when I wanted to commit suicide, I fell down from the chair.
    <br>When I fell, I cried, "God, I want to kill myself because of all the problems I am facing."
    <br>Then, I fell asleep.
    <br>While I was sleeping, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in a white garment.
    <br>He started praying for me and said, "So, you want to kill yourself over this little thing?"
    <br>I said, "This is more than my health. I cannot continue like this.
    <br>I have been facing this problem for three years - I'd better end it."
    <br>He prayed for me in my dream.
    <br>When he prayed for me, he said I was delivered.
    <br>Since then, I had been feeling the urge to vomit but I was unable to.
    <br>At night, I would not be able to sleep; I would have sleepless nights.
    <br>My whole body would be hot.
    <br>While the prayer was going on,
    <br>I was anxious that whatever that was inside of me should come out of my body
    <br>because I was not comfortable with it.
    <br>While the prayer was going on, I shouted, "God, deliver me!
    <br>I am not comfortable with this."
    <br>That was when all of this came out.
    <br>Now, I am lighter than before.
    <br>I no longer feel like vomiting.
    <br>I don't feel pain anymore.
    <br>Before, I used to feel pain in my tummy but now, I don't feel it anymore.
    <br>Before, I could not eat.
    <br>Since morning, I have not eaten;
    <br>I just drank milk because I was afraid that my tummy would start hurting me.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Someone took you to a place; you spent a night.
    <br>It was since that time you started having nightmares, eating with elders in the dream."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>My name is Saratu, I come from Kano.
    <br>Our sister here told me that she had never been to church before.
    <br>She said that she is a Muslim.
    <br>She told me that something was moving inside her body.
    <br>I asked her what was moving inside her body.
    <br>She still insisted that something was moving inside her body.
    <br>I told her to wait as this was her last bus stop.
    <br>She told me she wanted to go home; I kept telling her to wait.
    <br>She said she wanted to eat.
    <br>She said since morning, she couldn't eat because something was moving inside her body.
    <br>I was telling her to wait.
    <br>While the Mass Prayer was going on, she started vomiting the cowries.
    <br>Honestly, it surprised me.
    <br>My name is Augusta Thompson, I am from Bayelsa state.
    <br>This sister came with us in the morning.
    <br>The moment we sat down, she started complaining about her chest.
    <br>She said, "It's the first time that I am coming to this church. I am a Muslim."
    <br>I told her to relax.
    <br>She wanted to go back but I told her to relax as this was her last bus stop.
    <br>During the Mass Prayer, I told her, "You will conquer everything. God will do a miracle for you."
    <br>After the man of God touched her, she became angry and wanted to go home.
    <br>I said, "Relax!"
    <br>You mean that when the prophets were moving round touching people, when they touched her...
    <br>She became angry.
    <br>My sister and I told her, "Relax! Wait for the Mass Prayer and you will see miracles. God is here."
    <br>I talked to her and advised her that she would see something wonderful.
    <br>So, what happened when the Mass Prayer started?
    <br>Later on, she told me, "Something is moving inside of me."
    <br>I was very surprised.
    <br>When I turned back, I saw these cowries.
    <br>What was moving around in my body is not there anymore.
    <br>I thank God! To God be the glory"!
    <br>Until I saw them, I didn't know I had vomited cowries.
    <br>In fact, I really thank God. I am so happy because I am relieved.
    <br>I know that my problems are over; no more debt in my life.
    <br>What they were saying is true - today is my first time here.
    <br>I have never been here before.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Alhaja Bola, I am from Oyo state.
    <br>I am the woman that came here last Sunday and God delivered me.
    <br>I had been going through this problem for the last three years.
    <br>I went to borrow money from banks.
    <br>After I had borrowed money, armed robbers robbed me and took all the money from me.
    <br>After they took the money, I started going to different herbalists, to various places.
    <br>I asked them to do anything to help me get the money back, so the armed robbers would bring it back.
    <br>Instead of them doing that, there was no solution.
    <br>In fact, it is like they added to my problem.
    <br>After they gave me concoctions, a year later I felt something in my body.
    <br>I went there so I could get my money back but instead I was feeling something moving in me.
    <br>I would not be able to sleep at night; my body would be hot as if I was on top of a fire.
    <br>I went to the hospital where they examined me and said there was nothing in my body.
    <br>But I was feeling something moving in me.
    <br>They sent me for an x-ray where the they saw four things in me looking like tablets.
    <br>The man said that if they were tablets, they should have dissolved, so they suggested an operation.
    <br>I told them I did not have the money for an operation, because I was in financial difficulties.
    <br>When that problem came, I had to pay back money so I sold my house and car.
    <br>After repaying the money, I still had the problem and I did not have any money.
    <br>I decided I could not continue like this, with this moving object in my body; I did not have any solution.
    <br>So I wanted to end it all and hang myself.
    <br>That was on the previous Sunday.
    <br>I decided to hang myself in my room, tied the rope, hung it on the fan and put my neck in it, climbing on a chair.
    <br>After making my last prayer, I fell down and started crying.
    <br>I wondered what had happened and wanted to try again.
    <br>While crying, I fell asleep.
    <br>I saw somebody with a white garment tap me on my leg praying for me,
    <br>asking why I wanted to kill myself over this thing and telling me that if I killed myself God would ask me.
    <br>I responded that I wanted to kill myself because I could not continue like this.
    <br>He told me not to worry, that he would pray for me.
    <br>I asked who he was and he said he was 'Emmanuel'.
    <br>So I wondered who Emmanuel was because I didn't know anyone called that.
    <br>He again told me not to worry and that he would pray for me.
    <br>Then he prayed for me, saying I was delivered.
    <br>I doubted I could be delivered just like that but he told me that yes, I was delivered.
    <br>Ever since then, I no longer had this feeling in my body.
    <br>Something seemed to come up to my neck, as if I wanted to vomit it.
    <br>I told my daughter about someone coming to me in my dream,
    <br>praying for me and saying I was delivered and that he was 'Emmanuel'.
    <br>My daughter suggested we should google it.
    <br>We googled it and saw a lot of Emmanuels there.
    <br>My daughter asked me to describe what the man looked like.
    <br>I said he was tall and had a beard and looked healthy.
    <br>So she asked me to look at the pictures of the different Emmanuels.
    <br>So I identified the man and she said it was pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I did not know this name, but the text underneath said, 'Prophet T.B. Joshua'.
    <br>I was even afraid to leave home and I had to sell my phone to get money to come here.
    <br>I was afraid that I would not be welcome since I was a Muslim.
    <br>Last Sunday when I was here, I sat at the back.
    <br>The prophets were praying for people in the church and they came and prayed for me.
    <br>My body was shaking seriously after the prayer.
    <br>I thought I would fall down and wondered what was happening.
    <br>As my body was shaking, I felt something wanted to come out of me.
    <br>Have you experienced such before?
    <br>No!
    <br>So I was shaking and still wondering what was happening.
    <br>After the man of God left, I became angry and wanted to go home.
    <br>The woman beside me tried to calm me down and encouraged me to stay.
    <br>I complained that I wanted to leave because I had been to many places but had never shaken like that before.
    <br>The woman told me I should stay.
    <br>It Was Her FIRST TIME In Church - And THIS HAPPENED!!! 😳
    <br>Those prophets and prophetesses started saying we should pray.
    <br>I didn't know how to pray; all I kept repeating was, "God, deliver me."
    <br>As I was saying it, I felt I wanted to vomit something.
    <br>When I looked down, I vomited and felt free.
    <br>My body relaxed, as if a mountain had been removed from it.
    <br>I didn't know what I had vomited; I just felt that something heavy had been removed from me.
    <br>I started crying and felt weak.
    <br>They were asking me to look and see what I had vomited out.
    <br>I said, "Wow! Is this what I vomited? Oh my God."
    <br>My body was feeling light because I had vomited something out.
    <br>So, what was the thing you vomited?
    <br>When I looked at the floor and saw I had vomited cowries, I said, "Wow!"
    <br>How many cowries?
    <br>Four cowries.
    <br>I was surprised because I had eaten all kinds of things because
    <br>when you have a problem you will be looking for a solution.
    <br>Even as I am here now, God is telling me I should remove one thing from my body
    <br>to stop this problem finally, and I will remove it before I leave here.
    <br>It Was Her FIRST TIME In Church - And THIS HAPPENED!!! 😳
    <br>My name is Saratu Joseph; I came from Borno state but I was born in Kano.
    <br>Last Sunday was the first time I met this sister.
    <br>She said to me that it was her first time coming to The SCOAN.
    <br>I asked if she was a Muslim and she said, "Yes."
    <br>Later on, I saw that she had covered herself and she told me that she was going home.
    <br>I said, "Home? to do what?"
    <br>I told her to wait but she sad she wanted to go home.
    <br>I told her to wait as this place would be her last bus stop.
    <br>During the mass prayer, to my surprise, I saw her vomiting the cowries.
    <br>I was so surprised. In my entire life, I had never seen someone vomit cowries.
    <br>You saw it coming out from her mouth?
    <br>Yes, I was a witness; I saw it.
    <br>People of God, whatever challenges you might be facing,
    <br>just come to the house of the Lord; there is no need to go to anywhere else.
    <br>My name is Augusta Thompson from Bayelsa state.
    <br>Last Sunday, she was sitting beside me.
    <br>I saw her when she was shaking and I asked what her problem was.
    <br>She said it was her first time coming to church and that she had never entered a church before.
    <br>I said that she had to pray.
    <br>She said, "You don't understand. You don't know what is bothering me.
    <br>There is something moving in my body. My body is itching."
    <br>With anger, she said she wanted to go home.
    <br>I petted her. I said, "Relax! Don't be annoyed; just relax. This is your last bus stop.
    <br>You will receive your healing when the man of God touches you.
    <br>Everything will be okay.
    <br>You will receive your healing. This is your last bus stop."
    <br>During the mass prayer, I saw her vomit four cowries.
    <br>I wanted to move away but I could not move
    <br>until the evangelists came and told me to sit at the back.
    <br>When I got there, I became calm.
    <br>I was feeling pain for six months.
    <br>I had appendicitis.
    <br>During the mass prayer, I received my healing while she was vomiting the cowries.
    <br>The moment she vomited the cowries, I felt fire in my body.
    <br>Afterwards, I tapped my stomach and felt no pain.
    <br>I was healed immediately; there is no more pain in my body.
    <br>God had done it.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ?
    <br>It Was Her FIRST TIME In Church - And THIS HAPPENED!!! 😳
    <br>Before the message came from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>you had already concluded that these cowries you vomited may have come from your childhood.
    <br>But the message of prophecy from the man of God revealed something different.
    <br>He said you were taken to a place where you were given something
    <br>and from that time you started having nightmares, eating with elders in a dream,
    <br>and that was how this problem came about.
    <br>How can you confirm this prophecy to be true for your life?
    <br>It is true, because I ate some things due to that problem then.
    <br>They took me to a place.
    <br>Where is the place?
    <br>That was in my village.
    <br>The elder of witchcraft...
    <br>The head of the witchcraft in your village, you were taken there?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I got there, the man told me not to worry, that he would give me some power to receive all the money.
    <br>The money was a huge amount.
    <br>They gave me something to eat.
    <br>After eating it, instead of the problem being resolved, it got worse.
    <br>I have a message for the whole world.
    <br>When you have a problem, please, no matter how serious it may be, remember the devil is a liar.
    <br>He made me financially handicapped so I didn't know how I could get here.
    <br>But the thought came to me to find something to sell so I could come for my deliverance.
    <br>I went to sell my phone and I didn't mind whether I got the best price or how embarrassing it looked.
    <br>I didn't mind because I wanted my body to be delivered.
    <br>It Was Her FIRST TIME In Church - And THIS HAPPENED!!! 😳
    <br>Madam, what is this one?
    <br>It was one of those charms they gave me there.
    <br>So I want to relieve myself finally; I don't want anything in my body anymore.
    <br>It Was Her FIRST TIME In Church - And THIS HAPPENED!!! 😳
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I am free, I am delivered.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Alhaja Abolainwa Abiodun.
    <br>I thank God for what God has done for me in my life.
    <br>I am the woman that vomited cowries.
    <br>What brought me here was that I wanted to commit suicide because armed robbers robbed me.
    <br>They took a huge amount from me.
    <br>Ever since then, I had been going up and down to spiritual places to do something for me
    <br>so that I could receive my money back.
    <br>But over the last three years while I went to a series of herbalists, I did not receive the money back.
    <br>So I decided to commit suicide by hanging myself, but God revealed Himself in a dream.
    <br>In my dream I saw T.B. Joshua deliver me and tell me not to kill myself.
    <br>After that, I came to The SCOAN, where they delivered me and I vomited four cowries in the mass prayer.
    <br>When I vomited the cowries, the man of God gave me a prophecy that there was a man
    <br>that I went to meet in our village.
    <br>I said yes, that they had given me a concoction to eat and that was when the cowries entered me.
    <br>For the last three years, the cowries were troubling me and I could not do anything successfully.
    <br>After my deliverance, I no longer have any feelings to commit suicide.
    <br>I am free now, I don't have any pain anymore.
    <br>My tummy is no longer painful; I am free now; thank God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>After your deliverance, the man of God has looked into your case and would like to support you
    <br>with this cash gift as a new start to your life, as startup capital for whatever you want to do in life.
    <br>This is the sum of 200,000 naira that the man of God wants to give you to support you
    <br>in your new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>The man of God says that he also wants to give you this book, The Mirror, which is to help your spiritual life.
    <br>Thank you, T.B. Joshua, for the gift and the money, and Emmanuel TV Partners, thank you.
    <br>May God continue to bless you abundantly.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I am really excited.
