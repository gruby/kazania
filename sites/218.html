  <p>    
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Where is your wife?
    <br>I've got no wife now.
    <br>This is why I am asking you because this is the second time now.
    <br>If I marry, they run away.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>That is why I met you and that is the greatest challenge you are facing now.
    <br>You have been lonely for some time now.
    <br>Almost 20 years.
    <br>That is what I am saying.
    <br>I am living in England.
    <br>I brought two to England; they ran away.
    <br>They run away?
    <br>The one I married in Nigeria, I brought her there and she ran away.
    <br>They run away - almost four now.
    <br>You see! So that's why I am just a loner.
    <br>But there is a court case.
    <br>I want to advise you.
    <br>They had dismissed the case in the past.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK. I don't want to say more than that because I don't want anything to distort the case on the ground.
    <br>I will see you one on one.
    <br>Come here.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>There was a test doctor did for you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Is it prostate?
    <br>It is prostate.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>I see this is the third time now.
    <br>There was a heat, energy, light they blew into your anus.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They said they wanted to...
    <br>You have been battling with it for some time now.
    <br>Yes, I have been praying over it.
    <br>They could have operated on me but I said I did not want the operation.
    <br>That is what I am saying.
    <br>I said they would have operated you but you said no.
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>After receiving the word of prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua, Mr. Emmanuel came back to The SCOAN
    <br>with his family to be reconciled by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>As a communicator between the visible and the invisible, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>exposed the root cause of Mr. Emmanuel's problems through the word of prophecy
    <br>given to him by God Almighty.
    <br>Let's listen to Mr. Emmanuel as he confirms the prophecy.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>And that is my name too, Emmanuel.
    <br>My story is as big as this church.
    <br>My name is Emmanuel Nwoye Okpoko.
    <br>I live in the UK.
    <br>I have lived there for 22 years and there is nothing to show for it.
    <br>These people are my sons and my grandchildren there.
    <br>That woman there is my ex-wife.
    <br>Since 34 years that I separated from this woman, I saw her here in The SCOAN for the first time.
    <br>I never knew it could be possible.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God gave me a prophecy.
    <br>He said that I had married and re-married and that I've gotten three wives.
    <br>He then asked me where my wife was and I said I didn't have one because really, I have none.
    <br>I told him that if I married, they would run away as if I was the ugliest man in the world.
    <br>It all started when I wanted to get married.
    <br>I was not actually in love with my ex-wife; it was my mother's arrangement.
    <br>She said I was going to marry the lady.
    <br>I didn't know her but for me to respect my mother's decision,
    <br>for me to make my mother happy, I had to marry her.
    <br>Actually, when I married her, we were going fine.
    <br>Things were going fine until I started making money.
    <br>I was into transport business and I started flourishing.
    <br>I bought trailers and that was where the trouble started.
    <br>I can remember, she used to go to the saloon and I got some experience there.
    <br>She would tell me to sign blank cheques for her
    <br>so that she could put any figure she liked on my cheques and withdraw money.
    <br>I asked her where she got that idea from.
    <br>So, trouble started.
    <br>"Where did you get that, that I should sign a blank cheque for you to put any figure you like?"
    <br>I thought it was a joke.
    <br>The hatred increased; there was no month we were in peace.
    <br>To cut the story short...
    <br>I had two ships at Tin Can Wharf for clearing.
    <br>My wharf managers were already there.
    <br>I was carrying my briefcase to put inside my car to go to work.
    <br>All my sons were young then but they knew what happened.
    <br>As I was about to enter the car, she pulled my briefcase and said, "Don't you know that your daughter is sick
    <br>and you don’t care, you are going to work?"
    <br>I told her that I had introduced a doctor to her, if any of our children were sick
    <br>she should take them there for treatment and he would keep my bill for me.
    <br>She asked me, "Why?"
    <br>From there, trouble started.
    <br>And then she run outside.
    <br>She held me and fought me.
    <br>She was very big at that time.
    <br>I was struggling with her.
    <br>Imagine if a woman would have beaten me.
    <br>I had to stand on my feet and hit her hard.
    <br>She fell down and when she got up, she broke the windscreen of my car
    <br>in the front and back and then, ran away.
    <br>Obviously, I couldn't control myself so, I took my cutlass.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She was lucky that I didn't get her; only God knows what would've happened that day.
    <br>After that day, I couldn't take it anymore.
    <br>I told my brother to go and get a large vehicle
    <br>and pack anything she touched inside it and let her take it home
    <br>even though she did not have a dime in my house.
    <br>Anything she touched, she loaded inside the vehicle and took it home.
    <br>Then, I took all of my boys and put them in Santana Private Primary School
    <br>where I visited them every two weeks.
    <br>I was a single father; I brought up these children single-handedly.
    <br>Now, anywhere I go...
    <br>I am so emotional.
    <br>Anywhere I went, they were pointing that this was the woman destroying my life.
    <br>Any business I put together, nothing worked.
    <br>The whole thing had affected my children.
    <br>My children, these boys that you see, survived by God's mercy.
    <br>Nobody is a fraudster or thief; they are just good children.
    <br>Imagine a father leaving a country for 22 years and my children were on their own.
    <br>Why should I be happy?
    <br>I had no wife.
    <br>If I married, they ran away and they said it was the same woman who was doing the whole thing - Theresa.
    <br>Look at my granddaughter.
    <br>I had never seen her. I only saw her two days ago.
    <br>Look at my other granddaughter.
    <br>She punished me.
    <br>In England, I went everywhere.
    <br>There was no witchdoctor I had not gone to.
    <br>In short, there was nothing else I could do
    <br>until a friend introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>My son is a very successful businessman but it is always one step forward and three steps back.
    <br>When he told me, I said that if I returned to Nigeria, I would butcher this woman.
    <br>I would use my cutlass.
    <br>If she didn't die through juju (charms), I would use my cutlass to kill her.
    <br>My son told me that it was better that I came down.
    <br>I told him that I didn't have enough money but he said I should just come.
    <br>He said I should go and check how much a ticket cost.
    <br>I checked the price and before I knew it, he had paid money into my account.
    <br>Without telling anybody, I could not buy anything.
    <br>I wondered what I would do to my children and grandchildren.
    <br>He told me that shopping was not important at this point.
    <br>He had never been to any church.
    <br>If I told him about The SCOAN, he would be laughing at me.
    <br>He told me that he had heard a lot of things about The SCOAN.
    <br>He said that nothing worked and that everyone should defend themselves.
    <br>When I came on the 18th, I came to The SCOAN on Sunday.
    <br>As I sat down there, I couldn't believe my eyes.
    <br>The second person that the man of God touched was me.
    <br>He hit the nail on the head and told me all my problems.
    <br>I had done so many operations.
    <br>I told the doctor concerning my prostate that I would never operate it,
    <br>that I had to pray over it because I knew it was dangerous.
    <br>He hit the nail on the head and then told me to bring my whole family
    <br>because there were more things to be revealed.
    <br>I never knew the woman would agree to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I have two daughters in England, both of them are nurses.
    <br>The oldest one asked me if I was sure that their mother would come.
    <br>I said I didn't know but if she didn't come, I would tell Prophet T.B. Joshua that she is at large
    <br>and he would make her to come.
    <br>That was what I had in mind.
    <br>When I came to Nigeria, I asked my son if he could take me to The SCOAN.
    <br>He said he would give me his driver.
    <br>He gave me his driver and I came to the church early in the morning.
    <br>I told my son what the man of God had said and he said he would follow me.
    <br>This is my oldest son.
    <br>I told him and he agreed.
    <br>My third son is a footballer.
    <br>I tried everything for him to come to England but no way.
    <br>I spent a lot of money but no way.
    <br>He is my third son.
    <br>He doesn't talk to me for no reason.
    <br>He doesn't even talk to his brothers.
    <br>It was from the mum because he was not like this.
    <br>This boy saw me after 22 years at The SCOAN and was smiling at me, peacefully.
    <br>I carried my grandchildren.
    <br>Look at one of them.
    <br>I carried the other one in his hand also.
    <br>This baby was looking at me, smiling.
    <br>She slept in my arms and I wept.
    <br>On Thursday we were here.
    <br>It is a miracle for me to be able to bring them to The SCOAN today for deliverance.
    <br>It is a miracle for me already.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have listened to that?
    <br>That was last Sunday.
    <br>When the prophetic service was going on, amidst of the people there, our father was given a message,
    <br>exactly as you have heard.
    <br>I asked him to wait for me.
    <br>I wouldn't like to say much.
    <br>I know our father has some impression about our mummy sitting down.
    <br>Ogbologbo.
    <br>Everywhere I went, they told me she was a witch.
    <br>Pastors and prophets called her names.
    <br>You mean that many prophets told you she was a witch?
    <br>Yes, but they couldn't do anything.
    <br>What is Ogbologbo?
    <br>Ogolobo means "original witch".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>OK.
    <br>How many years ago you saw her last?
    <br>34 years.
    <br>Before you met her here on Thursday?
    <br>34 years before I met her here.
    <br>That was after the Sunday service...
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>... the following Thursday you met her?
    <br>Yes, the next Thursday she came.
    <br>You know, we are in the presence of God and nothing is hidden.
    <br>Our brothers, your children are standing there and listening.
    <br>I want to thank your son, who is not taking sides, he is standing neutral.
    <br>He believes that he is building his own family.
    <br>Look at the role our brother played.
    <br>What a decent role, trying to make sure he is not disconnected from the father or mother.
    <br>If not our brother here, we would not be able to sit here and talk
    <br>because the whole thing would have been worse.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If not the role he played, we would not be here today talking about reconciliation, deliverance, prophecy.
    <br>He made sure he played the role.
    <br>He made sure he invited his father, he even put money in his account.
    <br>He made sure the father came, and when the father came...
    <br>He didn't even say no; he said, "Synagogue? OK, let's go".
    <br>He tried to play two roles just like that.
    <br>The youth nowadays - we have a lesson to learn
    <br>because we normally take sides.
    <br>Anytime there is trouble between father and mother, instead of you to stand and take a different role...
    <br>I mean, stay clear from this matter and do not disconnect from your mother or father.
    <br>Our role in the matter of our father and mother actually matters.
    <br>If we are able to take a role our brother has taken, the situation would not become desolate.
    <br>Make sure to see what you can do by continuously praying for them
    <br>because they are your father and your mum.
    <br>No matter what happened, no matter the name we call mummy or father - they are the ones giving birth to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The names prophet and pastor nowadays have become titles.
    <br>We shouldn't be carried away by the title or name anybody bears.
    <br>A man can be a prophet, pastor or bishop, and yet unbeliever.
    <br>So, we still need to ask God.
    <br>We shouldn't be carried away, "All prophets or pastors have said that mummy is a witch"- no!
    <br>We still need to ask God.
    <br>In every situation God has something to say.
    <br>We need to ask God!
    <br>Who is mummy by the way?
    <br>This is the issue now.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I don’t know where to start but I know I have a lot to say.
    <br>My name is Ifeanyi Kenneth Okpoko.
    <br>I am the second son of the family.
    <br>I happen to be the most doubting of all the Thomases.
    <br>In the first place, I rarely go to church.
    <br>I have never been a church goer, I don’t even pray.
    <br>I just live as every other free man.
    <br>I just believe in the laws of nature; you do evil, evil comes to you; you do good, good comes to you.
    <br>I have always been a naturalist.
    <br>When I met my wife in Kano, she was introduced to me by a family I was supplying goods to.
    <br>That was a long time ago, in the year 2000.
    <br>One of the things she used to lure me into marrying her, was that she said that she was a Christian.
    <br>When talking to her, she would quote the book of James, etc.
    <br>Any conversation would end with Christ.
    <br>I thought that as I am not a Christian - I was a Christian by birth but not a practising one.
    <br>I decided to marry this woman who was very close to God.
    <br>It failed because the woman I thought would lead me to God, became something else after I married her.
    <br>When we moved to Lagos, she started worshipping in another place.
    <br>She went there every Sunday morning.
    <br>She would go to church singing praises but come back a wild creature.
    <br>She didn’t care about me or the family.
    <br>She would not care about my meal.
    <br>It continued until I became diabetic in 2005.
    <br>I told her about my health status and she didn't care.
    <br>She said that I could go and marry someone
    <br>who would take care of my diabetes that she didn't bargain for that.
    <br>As she got on with her career, it became worse.
    <br>She was working with Zenith Bank then.
    <br>After, she started working with UBA.
    <br>As her career progressed, she became more wild.
    <br>If I talked, she would shout at me and if I threatened her with separation,
    <br>she would say that her job was better without a husband so she was ready to leave.
    <br>These things would be happening and each time I spoke with my dad, he said that he wanted to come back
    <br>and that it appeared as if he and myself shared the same destiny.
    <br>I said no, that he just had to come back; to know what was really going on.
    <br>When we were growing up, my dad would be talking about my mum being a witch
    <br>but I didn’t want to dwell on that because I didn’t know how to identify a witch.
    <br>I tried as much as possible to play my role as a son, both to my mother and father.
    <br>If I went to England, my father would complain that his work was not good;
    <br>he didn’t know what happened to his money.
    <br>Each time I left him, I gave him some money.
    <br>When I came back to Nigeria, I called him to see how he was.
    <br>If he needed money, from the little I have, I sent to him like 2000 - 3000 pounds for his upkeep.
    <br>I did the same thing for my mum.
    <br>I tried to remain very neutral as I knew one day God would address the situation.
    <br>The first thing I did was to renovate my father's house in the village, which he was building before he left.
    <br>Then, I told my dad that I wanted my mum to come back to that house
    <br>so that someone would be there to take care of the house.
    <br>My dad said he didn't want to see that woman in his territory.
    <br>I didn't use force, I just tried to lure him by saying
    <br>that we should bring my mum to the house for the sake of keeping it clean.
    <br>So, because he listens to me, he agreed to let her come back.
    <br>That's how our mum started staying in our house.
    <br>Each time we came back, she would come to attend to us.
    <br>However, I was a person that didn't believe in miracles.
    <br>My dad told me that if he had money, he wanted to return to Nigeria
    <br>and the first place he would visit is The SCOAN.
    <br>I told him not to believe what he sees on television, that he shouldn't bother.
    <br>However, he insisted that when coming to Nigeria, he would go to The SCOAN.
    <br>I said, OK and asked whether he wanted money for a flight ticket.
    <br>He said that if he had the money, he would enter the next available flight.
    <br>I thought he was joking because I had done so many things to bring him back home
    <br>but each time I raised the topic, he would tell me one story or the other.
    <br>He would make an excuse about kidnapping or poor electricity.
    <br>I told him the electricity should not be a barrier as I had a generator in my house.
    <br>He asked about transportation, that he needed a car to move around.
    <br>I told him not to worry about that as I had cars in my house.
    <br>He kept giving one excuse or another.
    <br>One thing that made him want to come back was because he wanted to visit The SCOAN.
    <br>He said that he was coming back to go to The SCOAN and solve the problem.
    <br>I said that as he had said it, the problem is solved.
    <br>I didn't have the money he was asking for but I had a friend who normally gave him money in England.
    <br>I told him to pay 500 pounds into my dad's account
    <br>because my dad said he had found a ticked for about 500 pounds.
    <br>I told him that I would reimburse him.
    <br>The guy immediately gave him the money and my dad called me that he had received the money.
    <br>The next day, he called me and said the 500 pounds ticket would not work,
    <br>they said it was 625 pounds but I should not worry as he was going to make up
    <br>for the difference; he would get the remaining 125 pounds.
    <br>I said to myself, "If daddy is talking like this, then there is a miracle on the way".
    <br>I thought it was a joke until he called me and said he was in Nigeria.
    <br>I didn't believe it.
    <br>I called my elder brother to come to my house so that we could drive
    <br>straight to the airport because I live very close to the airport.
    <br>When my brother came, I told him we were expecting daddy.
    <br>He said, "Yes, but until we see him…"
    <br>We didn't go to the airport until he was outside at arrivals, calling me on the phone.
    <br>We had to rush to go and pick him up.
    <br>Behold, it was our dad!
    <br>I took him home and told everyone that daddy was around.
    <br>The next day he said, "I am going to The SCOAN. Early in the morning, please take me to The SCOAN".
    <br>I told him that I didn't like waking up early in the morning, that I was not a church fan
    <br>and that any of those prophetic things did not work for me.
    <br>My dad said, "You don't want to follow me to The SCOAN and it is very close to your house".
    <br>I told him that I didn't want to go, that I would allow my driver to sleep overnight and take him to The SCOAN.
    <br>So, I asked my driver to sleep overnight and very early in the morning,
    <br>before I had woken up, they had already gone.
    <br>When my dad came back about 1:30 am, he said, "Do you know that the man of God spotted me?"
    <br>He said that he was the second person spotted by the man of God.
    <br>I said, "You? Out of all the congregation and all the people who are coming to The SCOAN,
    <br>the man spotted you?" He said, "Yes".
    <br>I told him that I didn't believe him.
    <br>He said, "You didn't watch Emmanuel TV?"
    <br>I said, "I didn't".
    <br>He said, "This man spotted me and the first thing he asked me was, 'Where is your wife?'
    <br>So, this man went directly to the problem”.
    <br>I said, “What?”
    <br>He then said that the man of God said all the family members should come.
    <br>I asked him when the next appointment was.
    <br>He said that he didn’t know whether it was Thursday or Sunday.
    <br>In fact, he was so excited...
    <br>I said, “Let it be Thursday”.
    <br>I was supposed to travel for a job in the east but said that we should gather the whole family.
    <br>He said the first thing he knew was that my mum would not come.
    <br>I said, “Well, let us try that”.
    <br>I called my mother and told her that there was something going on in T.B. Joshua's church,
    <br>very close to where my younger brother lives.
    <br>My mum was staying with my younger brother.
    <br>The perfect thing about this miracle is that my mum who had always been in the village,
    <br>was in Lagos for some months because my younger brother's wife had a baby.
    <br>The whole thing was well arranged.
    <br>I know how I had been trying to get my mum to come and stay in Lagos but she would not want to stay.
    <br>My dad said, “This woman will not come. I bet you she will not come”.
    <br>I replied, “Daddy, don’t conclude. Let me invite her”.
    <br>I told my mother that her attention was needed in The SCOAN on Thursday.
    <br>My mum asked, “How early?”
    <br>I told her maybe by 5 am as people were many there.
    <br>My mum said, “No problem”.
    <br>I called my younger brother who she was staying with.
    <br>My younger brother said that he would bring her.
    <br>Nobody complained.
    <br>Very early, around 5 am, we were here and my mum was there.
    <br>Surprisingly, when we went to the canopy, my mum rushed towards my dad for the first time in 34 years
    <br>and said, “I want to greet you”.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>Yes, God has spoken.
    <br>Who is there to say "no" or "yes"?
    <br>[No one.]
    <br>OK. The question now is to ask God; whether trillion prophets, or all prophets of the world have spoken,
    <br>when God says "yes", no one...
    <br>What happened to our mum is a mere affliction.
    <br>Everyone also has this affliction.
    <br>When I say affliction, it doesn't mean you possess any power, it is rather a fruit of the flesh.
    <br>Mummy has that stubborn spirit.
    <br>She is not a witch.
    <br>This mummy is not a witch.
    <br>Please baba, she is not a witch.
    <br>I want to stand here to say that the steps you have taken so far - no one can blame you for that
    <br>because we don't know who is a prophet and who is not a prophet.
    <br>As a man who runs to ministers of God for counselling, for direction -
    <br>whatever you hear from them is final.
    <br>What you heard did not come from one, two, three but almost a hundred people saying the same thing.
    <br>So, no one can blame you.
    <br>My mummy is my mum, she is very stubborn; that's all.
    <br>I don't know what to say.
    <br>This is the first time in my life that I am believing in a miracle, directly!
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>I used to fall out with my mother.
    <br>Each time we would have a quarrel, I would tell her that she was as stubborn as my wife.
    <br>I told her that she was very stubborn and that that was why I married a woman who was like her,
    <br>that each time I told her what my wife was doing, she would not support me.
    <br>She would say, “I don’t want any of my sons to throw away their wives as your father threw me away".
    <br>I told her, “My daddy threw you away because you are stubborn”.
    <br>So, what the man of God said is absolutely true.
    <br>I have never said that my mum was a witch.
    <br>I always told my father, “Let God be the one to vindicate her”.
    <br>Each time my mother is talking...
    <br>One thing my mother would say was, “I am not afraid of going anywhere.
    <br>If I am a witch, Heaven will see but if I am not a witch, I will live to see the reconciliation of this family".
    <br>This is wonderful!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>34 years.
    <br>Let us blame satan.
    <br>Don't blame your husband, your husband also cannot blame you for what happened.
    <br>Satan we should blame.
    <br>Satan - shame on you.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>I want to host you people.
    <br>I want to join your family.
    <br>From now on, I want to join your family, I am a part of the family.
    <br>I will leave my 2 bedroom flat and another 2 bedroom flat for the whole family until I finish seeing them.
    <br>When they leave here, they should set a table and let them meet together.
    <br>Baba, I will meet you one on one for counselling - let us talk.
    <br>We have to talk.
    <br>I want to congratulate you - you have wonderful children.
    <br>Even my brother - you say he doesn't greet you.
    <br>It is not his fault.
    <br>He doesn't know what to do.
    <br>He is confused.
    <br>He is just confused because the whole thing has affected the children.
    <br>The children don't know what to do.
    <br>This man is just enjoying the grace of standing, carrying out the little assignment of bringing the family together.
    <br>It is not his fault, he doesn't hate you.
    <br>You have wonderful children.
    <br>I want to thank you very much for your role.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So, mummy, you will come back for testimony.
    <br>Please, just sit down.
    <br>I am very happy for the whole thing.
    <br>I knew before I left England that I would have the last laugh and I am getting it.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I thank God for a day like this.
    <br>I thank God for raising a prophet like T.B. Joshua in our time.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>Some of my friends from South Africa, England, call me often to tell me,
    <br>“Look, you are living just behind the prophet and people are coming from all over the world to tap from
    <br>this anointing and you are so close and you tell me you are a diabetic for eight years”.
    <br>I feel pity for myself because if I had known Prophet T.B. Joshua before,
    <br>my marriage would not have been a wreck.
    <br>But today, I now know and I am standing in this auditorium to tell everybody anywhere in the world,
    <br>that whatever I can believe in is very real – any time, any day.
    <br>My diabetes has gone!
    <br>Anywhere I was going, I would go with drugs, which were always in my pocket.
    <br>Even when I was coming to see T.B. Joshua, I needed to eat and take my drugs.
    <br>I didn’t believe in anything; I believed in my drugs.
    <br>This is gliclazide, this one is galvus met.
    <br>I had been on these drugs for eight years.
    <br>I had been languishin
    <br>I don't know, I've been wasting.
    <br>Please, I want to see them.
    <br>Let the family go and have time together.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>Earth has no sorrow that Heaven does not feel.
    <br>The reconciliation of this family proves that Jesus Christ is concerned about us, wants to be involved
    <br>in everything about us, and walk us through whatever life brings.
    <br>As Christians, we are commissioned solution providers, and have been given the ministry of reconciliation.
    <br>The joy on their faces are evident, as they leave the auditorium
    <br>to have their first family meal together in years.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ, for restoring this broken home.

    <br>My name is Obiageri Okpoko, the daughter-in-law of Emmanuel Okpoko, which is our daddy.
    <br>My mother-in-law is Theresa Okpoko.
    <br>I thank T.B. Joshua for this day because it is a great day in this family of Okpoko.
    <br>We had been waiting for this day to happen in our lives to see the solution - the end of this problem.
    <br>If you had never seen or witnessed such, you would not know that this is a problem.
    <br>It is not until it happens to you that you will know that it is a big problem.
    <br>I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for bringing us together.
    <br>May the Lord who has put him in this position ensure he is never brought down.
    <br>For his generation and all the people who have worked in his ministry,
    <br>their story will never remain the same, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>In conclusion – Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23).
    <br>My name is Ebiseme Okpoko.
    <br>I am the wife of the third son.
    <br>I would say that I am the happiest person here because I remember when I was getting married to my husband,
    <br>my family thought that he never had any family members.
    <br>I am so happy because I believe, right now, they will be watching me,
    <br>sitting and dining with my husband’s family.
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>It is a wonderful day!
    <br>I never believed that in this world, I would be able to toast with my ex-wife.
    <br>I never knew it could ever be like this but it has happened!
    <br>To be honest, it is a wonderful day for me.
    <br>Not only that, I have forgiven her for whatever had happened between us.
    <br>My heart is clear.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Now, she is my wife!

    <br>After their glorious reconciliation in Christ Jesus, the Okpoko family spent quality time together
    <br>at the faith resort ground of The SCOAN
    <br>praying in unity as a family and worshipping God in the beauty of His holiness.
    <br>Truly, the Gospel of God's grace changes and challenges everything.

    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Okechukwu Francis Okpoko.
    <br>I am the eldest son of Mr. Emmanuel Okpoko.
    <br>I want to thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I want to thank God for a day like this.
    <br>I never believed in my lifetime that I would be a part of this.
    <br>Seeing my mother and father come back together after 34 years, to me, it is more than a miracle.
    <br>It is more than a miracle!
    <br>My junior brother has said a lot.
    <br>I just want to thank God for a day like this.
    <br>My name is Ikechukwu Okpoko.
    <br>I am the third son.
    <br>My brothers have said it all.
    <br>I don’t need to say anything much than to say, Emmanuel!
    <br>I give Him the glory!
    <br>I have seen many prophets but there is no prophet like him.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)

    <br>The Okpoko Family Fellowship Together
    <br>At The Faith Resort Ground
    <br>With the pain of the past gone and forgotten, the family hug themselves and laugh together.
    <br>It is hard to imagine that this family had been separated for more than 34 years.
    <br>After the word of prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua the power of God stepped onto the scene
    <br>and broke the spirit of division and unforgiveness, that had held the family in bondage for so many decades.
    <br>Following this remarkable reconciliation, the family returned for a joyous testimony the following week.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Today is a great day for me and I never knew that a day like this would come.
    <br>You can see my wife here.
    <br>I never realised I could ever be together with her.
    <br>I never dreamt that it could be possible.
    <br>Her name is Theresa.
    <br>My name is Emmanuel Nwoye Okpoko from Anambra State.
    <br>Since this problem started, the hatred was so much that I didn't like to see any woman whose name was Theresa.
    <br>I didn’t even give them a lift in my car.
    <br>If I gave you a lift and your name was Theresa, I would ask you to get out.
    <br>You can imagine the weight of the whole thing before I left for England.
    <br>One step forward and three steps backward.
    <br>I was in England but had nothing to show for it.
    <br>Was I the only African man in England?
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>I would make money but the money would disappear.
    <br>Sometimes...
    <br>I would make money, pay it into the bank
    <br>but when I went there the next week, the money would be gone.
    <br>I never knew that there was a way that things could happen negatively
    <br>such that you would be labouring in vain.
    <br>For everything, I blamed my wife.
    <br>Everything that would happen, I’d blame my wife that she might be the cause.
    <br>I was proved wrong last Sunday by the man of God that she was not a witch.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>Most surprisingly, today, when we were on the prayer line
    <br>and the wise men were touching us, I was eagerly looking at her.
    <br>The first set of wise men came and touched her; nothing happened.
    <br>Another set came, touched her but nothing happened.
    <br>Up to seven times, she was just calm.
    <br>Then I came out from my...
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>I got up from my seat and shook her hands because I was surprised.
    <br>Since that Sunday...
    <br>Today, I have actually accepted her back.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>For 34 years, we had no contact of any kind.
    <br>The hatred had built up. Today, everything has been cleared.
    <br>There is no hatred between us or among our children.
    <br>Look at my children and grandchildren.
    <br>All of them came out from me and her.
    <br>She is the mother of all these children.
    <br>I thank God and the man of God for making it real.
    <br>I never believed that a day like this would come to pass.
    <br>Glory be to God for making it possible for me and my family.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>Praise the Almighty God!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>My name is Mrs. Theresa Nwamaka Okpoko
    <br>This is my second time of entering this church.
    <br>I thank Almighty God for T.B. Joshua who vindicated me from the allegations of being a witch,
    <br>which had spread to my home-town and among my children.
    <br>As God has made it, God knows better than me.
    <br>I also thank Almighty God for uniting me with my children and husband.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>My name is Okochukwu Francis Okpoko.
    <br>I am the eldest son of Mr. Emmanuel Okpoko.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I thank God for a day like this and that I am alive to witness this great reunion.
    <br>I never believed that I would live to see a day like this.
    <br>For 34 years, my parents had been separated and the hatred they had between them was unimaginable.
    <br>I think that it is only in The SCOAN that this kind of miracle could happen.
    <br>There is no other place in the world...
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>Through the prophecy that the man of God gave him, things started to turn around in our family.
    <br>In fact, for the first time ,we prayed and ate together in 34 years.
    <br>It is unbelievable!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Kenneth Ifeanyi Okpoko.
    <br>I am the second son of the family.
    <br>If I was allowed to give testimony continuously,
    <br>I would give this testimony for a whole year; every Sunday for one year.
    <br>I remain the most amazed of all the members of the family.
    <br>Amazed in the sense that I never believed a day like this would come to pass.
    <br>When my dad was insisting on coming to Nigeria to The SCOAN, I thought it was one of his false promises
    <br>because many times I had tried to bring him home but he had always come up with one excuse or the other.
    <br>Surprisingly, this time around, he decided on his own that he was going to come,
    <br>that all he wanted me to do was to send the ticket money, if I could afford it.
    <br>I said, “Why not?” And I did.
    <br>He came into the country on a Thursday.
    <br>He started telling me on Saturday evening that I should take him to The SCOAN.
    <br>I told him that I didn’t like anything that would disrupt my sleep.
    <br>He was talking about waking up at 5am to go to The SCOAN and I have never done that for a very long time.
    <br>I could only wake up that early if somebody asked me to collect money for a contract -
    <br>that is the truth – not to go to a prophet whom I thought was full of lies and deceit
    <br>because that was how I saw prophets all over the country.
    <br>I am sorry to say that but that was the reality.
    <br>Honestly, it is only in a church like this, as my brother said
    <br>because the reunion and prophecy have not only reconciled my family;
    <br>it has reconciled me and God because I rarely went to church.
    <br>In a nutshell, the disunity had taken a toll on the family.
    <br>It disrupted our educational careers because at the time after my mother left the family,
    <br>things started working anti-clockwise for my dad.
    <br>He tried to marry another wife; the woman came in.
    <br>She did her best; she was a wonderful woman as a matter of fact.
    <br>She brought us all up the way our dad wanted it but things were not working; they worked anti-clockwise.
    <br>My dad had always told us that our mother was a witch
    <br>and that she had been against his progress since she left.
    <br>When I was growing up, I started playing a very neutral role on the issue,
    <br>believing that I did not have any instrument for scanning witches.
    <br>I knew that if my dad was correct, one day, God would reveal it to him and
    <br>if he was not, one day, God would reveal it to him.
    <br>I have always tried to play the role of a son to both parents because that was what mattered.
    <br>I had been an unbiased umpire on the matter.
    <br>If I saw my dad in England, I tried to make him comfortable as much as I could and
    <br>back here in Nigeria, I tried to give my mother all the comfort I could afford,
    <br>believing that one day, a day like this would actually come.
    <br>I didn’t know it would come so soon.
    <br>If I call Prophet T.B. Joshua a prophet, it is an understatement.
    <br>I prefer to see him as God's incarnate.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>We know you have a lot to say.
    <br>But we want to make one point clear that the man of God said, "He is not the Healer, he is not the Deliverer,
    <br>he is not the Saviour. He only knows the Saviour, he only knows the Healer, he only know the Deliverer,
    <br>who is our Lord and Saviour. He is not Jesus. He is a servant of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
    <br>We thank God for using the man of God in this mighty way, to do these mighty things in the lives of the people.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chinwendu Okpoko.
    <br>I happen to be the last child of my mother.
    <br>My mother happens to be the second wife of my dad.
    <br>Growing up without a dad was really challenging for me.
    <br>I remember, way back in primary school if I was asked where my dad was, I really had nothing to say.
    <br>It was really challenging for me but I want to bless the name of God for making it possible for me to see
    <br>my dad for the first time in my life after how many years.
    <br>Could you tell us, how old are you now?
    <br>I am 23 years old.
    <br>So, for 23 years, you are seeing your father for the first time?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Here, at The SCOAN?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ikechukwu Okpoko.
    <br>I am the third son.
    <br>I thank God for today and I know that whatever God has done is permanent.
    <br>Nobody can change it.
    <br>I believe one thing about The SCOAN - the prophecies here are very accurate and unmistakable.
    <br>I don’t really understand, I am not a man of God but the way he does his things, only God knows.
    <br>Everything he says is accurate; and don’t doubt it.
    <br>Just don’t doubt it.
    <br>Okpoko Family Reconciliation
    <br>Now that God has brought unity, peace and comfort into the family,
    <br>as Joshua said, as for him and his family, they will serve the Lord;
    <br>we want the whole family to go and serve the Lord in Spirit and in Truth.
    <br>As you do so, the blessings of God will continue to abide in this family, in Jesus' name.
