  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>wherever you are, whatever medium you are using to view us,
    <br>hear Jesus to those in darkness - "Come out, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Every challenge and situation you are in is darkness.
    <br>Hear Jesus to those in darkness - "Out, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>To those in captivity - "Be free, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Freedom!
    <br>Whatever situation you are in - freedom from sickness to good health, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>To those who are sick - "Be healed!"
    <br>To those who are oppressed - "Be delivered!"
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can hear you being free!
    <br>You are saved, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Begin to rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Rejoice!
