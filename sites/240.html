    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>God wants to use you but you have a problem.
    <br>There is a controversy over a child.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>I want to see him.
    <br>After giving words of prophecy to this man, pointing him to the root cause of his problem,
    <br>the man of God moves on as Jesus did,
    <br>ministering prophecy and deliverance to the congregation, one after the other,
    <br>for prophecy brings solution.
    <br>At a point he came to this woman.
    <br>Let's hear what he has to say to her.
    <br>- You have to forgive this man.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- It is too painful.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- You know, this is your second disappointment.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Can you forgive?
    <br>- Yes, sir, I will.
    <br>If you forgive, you have to withdraw the case.
    <br>OK, sir.
    <br>- Withdraw the case and put an end to that.
    <br>- OK, sir.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Come, give me your hand.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>He is here with me.
    <br>You gave him a prophecy.
    <br>Go and call your husband.
    <br>The woman moves ahead to call her husband
    <br>and the husband turns out to be the man the man of God prophesied to earlier on
    <br>about a controversy over a child.
    <br>Indeed, the Spirit of God is all-knowing.
    <br>You know, you were sitting here and I was telling you there was a controversy over a child.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is a son and you did not answer me.
    <br>This is your wife.
    <br>I met your wife and the same thing appeared to me, that there is a controversy issue.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>And Mr T.B. Joshua did not know whether they are husband and wife,
    <br>but the Prophet said, "Oh, this is controversy". - "Oh, sir, he is the man you are talking to."
    <br>What is there?
    <br>This is my third child and he happens to be the first child of the family.
    <br>When we had him, he was a little bit imbalanced.
    <br>We don't know the cause of the problem.
    <br>I went to Italy to do all the tests concerning him but there were no findings.
    <br>On a daily basis, even this morning, I had an argument with my husband
    <br>concerning this child, about his growth and every other thing.
    <br>Most times, we have arguments or some controversies over him.
    <br>The controversy is, he is asking himself, "But this thing is not in our family;
    <br>are you sure this child is my own?"
    <br>- Is that not the question?
    <br>- It is true, sir.
    <br>He was actually asking this question...
    <br>Wait. Don't worry. Don't talk too much.
    <br>This thing that is happening now, the family is the one on him.
    <br>They are asking, "Where did you get this kind of sickness in the family?
    <br>Are you sure you are the father of this child?"
    <br>For a long time they have been saying it but he was bold enough to ask,
    <br>"Look, am I the father of this child?"
    <br>I even asked the boy one day, "Who is your father?"
    <br>They are asking the boy, "Who is your father?"
    <br>What did the boy say?
    <br>He asked me back, "Who is your father?"
    <br>Can you clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Can you see what Jesus is doing?
    <br>Who would have changed this?
    <br>It is a matter beyond human.
    <br>I said to the man; the man does not want to talk.
    <br>Because I'm in a hurry, I have to leave him.
    <br>I know the problem, I just...
    <br>But when I got to the woman, I said, "Come on. There is a controversy."
    <br>"That is the man you are talking about."
    <br>I said, "Is he your husband? OK, the two of you should come."
    <br>Can you see the issue?
    <br>If this issue is not ironed out, this matter would separate the marriage.
    <br>Because of that, there is no affection between the two of them.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>So, you people wait for me - this is why you are here.
    <br>And I will meet you people. 
    <br>OK?
    <br>It is satan that wanted to crush the house.
    <br>What he wants to achieve is to separate you.
    <br>He has started it.
    <br>Half-half, 50-50 now.
    <br>You are out 50; you are in 50.
    <br>Your husband is out 50; he is in 50.
    <br>So, therefore, it is just 50-50.
    <br>One leg out.
    <br>The husband too, one leg out.
    <br>It is only one leg that is inside.
    <br>The left leg of the wife is inside; the left leg of the husband is inside.
    <br>The right leg of the wife is outside.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>Because he's tired.
    <br>Don't worry. That is not the issue of deliverance now; it's what's God's opinion.
    <br>Even last August, she came here; I was abroad.
    <br>You prophesied to her that she wanted to leave the marriage and you asked her to invite me.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>This is your child.
    <br>I will invite the child.
    <br>He is your child.
    <br>Do you know the cause?
    <br>It is medication.
    <br>It is the medication that you and her agreed on.
    <br>It is the medication that the two of you agreed on that is causing that deformation.
    <br>There was a time you went to the hospital;
    <br>you thought you would deliver, but you went back home.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You know that at the time she conceived, you did not agree with her.
    <br>- You said you were not ready.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>She went to the hospital to try and remove the child; no way.
    <br>She thought they removed it because the menstruation came.
    <br>It was not menstruation; it was just some blood.
    <br>The child was still inside.
    <br>The tablet was the cause.
    <br>She thought the pregnancy had come down because she saw blood
    <br>but the blood came out to deceive.
    <br>The child was there but he was injured.
    <br>You and your wife cursed this child, not anybody else.
    <br>I will see you people and I want to join your family.
    <br>You go and wait for me.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Prophecies - it's beyond human understanding.
    <br>I had to bring them back - the reason, what is the cause.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>When you look at the whole world today, you will see our Saviour is not all that popular anymore.
    <br>People are running to the world.
    <br>If I'm talking, let me see your hand.
    <br>We cannot put Jesus anymore as Saviour, Redeemer, Healer, Deliverer.
    <br>The Jesus we read about in the Bible is not the Jesus we are serving today.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>The young ones know that Jesus they read about in the Bible is not the Jesus we are following today.
    <br>What has happened now should not come as a surprise to you.
    <br>You should examine what is in the Bible.
    <br>This is exactly what Jesus said about Himself.
    <br>It is in the Bible.
    <br>Faith demands impossible, not possible things.
    <br>The meaning of "faith demands impossible" is that
    <br>a doctor can treat - it is not that kind of headache faith is demanding for.
    <br>Faith is there, when it is impossible for the doctor, for man -
    <br>now, faith is there to make it possible.
    <br>That is the work of faith.
    <br>Sometimes, when I hear people say, "I pray, fan stop now" and I say, "I pray the fan starts working."
    <br>A mechanic can do that.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>Faith is talking about curses.
    <br>Say, "Faith is talking about curses."
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>That is when something is beyond; it is no longer a sickness, it becomes a curse,
    <br>which is opposite to that sickness you are talking about.
    <br>You have cancer.
    <br>If you take it to the doctor, they will handle it, if it is cancer.
    <br>But if this cancer becomes now a curse, no doctor can cure it, and no doctor can treat it.
    <br>That is what faith demands for.
    <br>Poverty - if you are truly poor, and your poverty has not turned to curse,
    <br>when they give you money, it will solve your problem.
    <br>But if this poverty has turned to a curse, they can give you the whole money
    <br>in the Central Bank, World Bank, you will enter another problem again.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If your poverty has not turned to a curse, money will solve it.
    <br>Somebody gives you money, you invest it and it will turn your situation around.
    <br>But if that poverty has turned to a curse, no amount of money given to you will solve your problem.
    <br>Rather, it will put you to more debts.
    <br>This is why you hear of people dying of headache.
    <br>It means it is no longer a headache, it is a curse.
    <br>This is why you hear people die of leg pain.
    <br>It is no longer a leg pain, it has turned to a curse.
    <br>This is why you hear people have depression and commit suicide.
    <br>It is no longer depression, it has become a curse.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>That is all.
    <br>Faith demands impossible.
    <br>It is like we don't understand the word "faith",
    <br>and we don't know what we are talking about when we talk of faith.
    <br>Poverty can be addressed when you are given money.
    <br>Sickness can be addressed when you see a doctor.
    <br>Hardship can be addressed if it is really hardship.
    <br>But if those things become a curse, it is only Jesus who can remove this curse.
    <br>This is why you keep asking yourself,
    <br>"This man had a headache. I also had a headache.
    <br>We saw a doctor and the doctor gave us similar medications.
    <br>The medication given to this man is the same medication given to me
    <br>but it has been established that both of us had headache and they gave us similar medication.
    <br>And immediately my friend took the medication, his headache subsided,
    <br>and he said, 'Oh, my headache is gone'.
    <br>But you took your own and your headache increased, became worse.
    <br>It shows that yours is no longer a headache, it is a curse.
    <br>Anytime you are in trouble, you need to know to be careful.
    <br>It will be too soon, too quick to begin to think -
    <br>you have cancer and you see people dying of cancer.
    <br>Don't come to that conclusion.
    <br>Yours may be cancer and it can be addressed medically by a doctor.
    <br>But these people that are dying of cancer, their own cancer has turned to curse.
    <br>But if your own has not turned to curse and you begin to compare yourself,
    <br>begin to think, "These people die of cancer and I have similar cancer",
    <br>and you begin to think that you will die soon,
    <br>you are inviting curse to your life.
    <br>It is fear that kills people, not even the sickness.
    <br>As Christians, these are the things we should know.
    <br>You have cancer and others have cancer
    <br>and you see them dying of the same cancer you have.
    <br>Even sometimes, the doctor will say your own cancer is even more, it has spread everywhere in your body.
    <br>Those whose cancers are in a very early stage, they are dying.
    <br>But yours has gone too far.
    <br>You are now ready to begin to write your will, you will begin to tell people.
    <br>You invite more sickness to yourself, the pressure comes upon you.
    <br>You are now ready to die.
    <br>You begin to imagine how many feet - six feet.
    <br>You begin to imagine being covered by sand.
    <br>You begin to imagine when people would come and say, "Bye bye."
    <br>You begin to imagine...
    <br>You begin to count members of your family that have died, maybe you would see them very soon.
    <br>You would remember that your friend who died, "Oh, I will see this man.
    <br>I don't know whether he is fat now or he is still slim."
    <br>Already, you are inviting curse to yourself.
    <br>But when you know that there is what we call sickness, and what we call curse,
    <br>you will not come to a conclusion and begin to compare yourself to these people.
    <br>You will know their own cases have become curses.
    <br>Sickness doesn't kill; it is when it turns to curse, it kills.
    <br>It doesn't kill.
    <br>That is why Apostle Paul lived his life with a thorn in his flesh
    <br>and the Bible never said it was a thorn that kills.
    <br>But he lived long years and finished his duty, and accomplished his...
    <br>If your faith is lifted up, let me see your hand.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Sickness can come upon me but a curse cannot come upon me."
    <br>It is a curse that the Bible says cannot come upon me
    <br>because Jesus died and took away our curse.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>He took away our curse.
    <br>Sickness will come.
    <br>It cannot destroy you because it is not a curse.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Emenari Benjamin.
    <br>I am from Anambra State.
    <br>The woman standing by my side is my wife, and this is my first son.
    <br>Last week, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me a prophecy.
    <br>He came to me and asked if he could talk to me and I said, "Yes, Man of God."
    <br>He said that God wanted to use me and I said, "Yes."
    <br>He said, "But there is a controversy over a child."
    <br>As a lengthy time elapsed before I could speak, he left me.
    <br>After a while, my wife came to call me because he went to her
    <br>and gave her the same prophecy.
    <br>I confirm this prophecy to be true because my son was born in 2005.
    <br>I live in Enugu but reside abroad.
    <br>This is the third child I had and the first son.
    <br>When my wife gave birth to the child, I left for Italy where I was staying
    <br>and I was preparing their documents.
    <br>They came by the time the child was three years old.
    <br>On my arrival, I discovered that the child was not behaving normally.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, at the age of three, he was still wearing pampers.
    <br>I was mad because my other children were so good.
    <br>The first one is 13 years old.
    <br>He is in SS1 and never comes second in class.
    <br>The second one is 11 years old.
    <br>He is in JS2.
    <br>All of them normally do very well in school.
    <br>But this particular one was not normal at all.
    <br>I started getting worried.
    <br>I started trying to find a solution.
    <br>I took the child to different hospitals in Italy.
    <br>After all the tests, they failed to discover the actual problem.
    <br>But they always told me that it was a problem that they could not solve.
    <br>I got worried to the extent that every time, I would quarrel with my wife.
    <br>I started demanding for another child
    <br>because I am the kind of person who is always aggressive in what I do.
    <br>I felt that this was not my child.
    <br>I told my wife that I needed to have another boy.
    <br>We started arguing because we had agreed initially that we would stop.
    <br>I insisted to the extent that I called her mother at home and said I needed another boy
    <br>because I needed a boy who would be my real child.
    <br>That was the problem and it continued.
    <br>Because of that, I decided that they should go back to Nigeria
    <br>and stay there so that they could start going to school.
    <br>I started finding better work to give him a better education but that problem did not stop.
    <br>Each time I looked at him, I got demoralised.
    <br>I saw him walk normally.
    <br>Now, he is eight years old but he is still in Primary 2.
    <br>We have gone to a lot of churches, trying to find a solution.
    <br>We could not find a solution to his problem.
    <br>You have listened to the family.
    <br>The joy that will crown the whole thing is for this child to be restored.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>It is brain damage
    <br>as a result of what I told them.
    <br>So, we will come together, we will pray together.
    <br>I will take it as my duty, as my own son and see how this child can be restored.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>This is just the value of prophetic service.
    <br>Can you see, a child at home?
    <br>And the man of God is talking here, the husband is in front, the wife is at the back.
    <br>Can you imagine?
    <br>And at the end of the day, it connects them again.
    <br>Not only the restoration of this boy;
    <br>now, even the families of this man and this lady know the cause of what was between the two of them.
    <br>Before now they were tracing it to either her committing adultery - this is why this thing happened -
    <br>or witches and wizards - "this woman should go.
    <br>We don't want this kind of thing in the family."
    <br>But they now see that it was between them.
    <br>This is what faith demands for.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is what faith demands for."
    <br>Because this one is beyond physicians.
    <br>This one is beyond any human being.
    <br>This is what we call faith.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>Brother, come here.
    <br>Put your Bible down.
    <br>I'm a pastor.
    <br>I come to you for a medical check-up all the time - you are a doctor.
    <br>But in my church I profess healing, deliverance.
    <br>But I have a stomach trouble - I come to you for examination.
    <br>You examine me, you prescribe a drug for me and I take it home.
    <br>When you sit down at home, you watch a Christian channel,
    <br>you see me saying, "Be healed! Your stomach!"
    <br>You say, "Look at your friend."
    <br>You call another doctor, "Come and watch.
    <br>Is that not the man whose stomach we examined yesterday? He is the one.
    <br>He is using a tablet, and he is telling somebody, 'Be healed!' "
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>It will be very difficult for you, as a doctor, to believe me.
    <br>You will now say, "I prescribed a test for his stomach. He is coming next week."
    <br>"Put your hand here. OK, no. Be healed!"
    <br>Now you say, "My stomach pain disappeared. I'm healed now."
    <br>The doctor would say, "See your friend."
    <br>What you can take to them is something that can be defined.
    <br>We can be able to define God and the physician.
    <br>Doctors treat; God heals.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Something beyond them...
    <br>If something is beyond them and they know it is God how does it, they agree.
    <br>But something that is not beyond them...
    <br>Now, I go to meet them and say, "I have this thing. Treat me."
    <br>And they handle it and treat me
    <br>and I now begin to attend to people that have a similar issue.
    <br>It will be difficult for them to believe.
    <br>Can you see the level to which we brought Jesus to?
    <br>Kingdom business, we have brought it to the level of business work,
    <br>and it is a Kingdom business.
    <br>Sit down, sir.
    <br>I hope...
    <br>These are things that are affecting Jesus, His image among the people.
    <br>There is sickness, there is curse.
    <br>Like I have said, we treat but God heals.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You are coming back to give testimony.
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>My name is Mrs Sandra Emenari.
    <br>I am originally from Anambra State but I reside in Enugu State.
    <br>Well, I'm really very very happy.
    <br>I would have loved the man of God to give me an opportunity because my husband did not say it all.
    <br>I'm a woman and I know what I passed through.
    <br>Last Saturday, the prophecy the man of God gave me was one hundred percent correct.
    <br>It was actually very painful because I had this boy in 2005.
    <br>During the period of the pregnancy, I was having a threatening abortion.
    <br>I called him because he wasn't with me.
    <br>I called him and we agreed that my brother would take me to the hospital.
    <br>Eventually, we went to the hospital and the doctor gave me medication.
    <br>During the course of taking the medication, I noticed a drop of blood.
    <br>I was so worried that I went back to the doctor.
    <br>The doctor told me that there was no problem, that sometimes in pregnancy, it occurs.
    <br>Eventually, when I had this baby, at the age of ten months to one year,
    <br>I observed that there were some abnormalities in his activities.
    <br>I became very worried.
    <br>In Nigeria, I went to a neurologist in Enugu State.
    <br>The woman carried out investigations on the child
    <br>and told me that she could not find anything.
    <br>When I travelled abroad, it became a burden to me
    <br>because the activities of the boy was affecting me.
    <br>When we were in public places, people appreciated him as a very handsome
    <br>young little gentleman but when he acted, I always felt ashamed.
    <br>So, it was a burden to me to find a medical solution.
    <br>I went to the hospital in Italy and they conducted a lot of tests on him
    <br>and eventually invited me and my husband to come for the results.
    <br>They said that they observed a blockage of some blood in his brain
    <br>and because of the blockage, he was behaving abnormally.
    <br>I should put my trust in God because it was only God who could solve my problems.
    <br>The controversy he prophesied about concerning this boy is true
    <br>because I have passed through a lot of hell because of this boy.
    <br>My husband accused me several times in a very painful way,
    <br>even in front of my own people, that he doesn't think that this boy is his.
    <br>It was very painful because I know that there was nothing
    <br>like infidelity or acts of promiscuity in my family.
    <br>I respect God a lot, I respect him a lot and above all, I respect my children.
    <br>So, I always keep to myself.
    <br>I have never thought of doing such a thing; so, it was very painful.
    <br>We would always have heated arguments because of this
    <br>and most times after arguing, I felt like leaving him.
    <br>I had even told him that if he continued like that
    <br>during that particular period, I would leave the house for him.
    <br>I confirm that prophecy to be one hundred percent correct.
    <br>"Controversy Over This Child..." - T.B. JOSHUA PERSONAL PROPHECY
    <br>Thank you. Like I have said, you are coming back for another testimony.
    <br>My mind is on how this boy can be restored.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Very handsome guy.
    <br>Even the father knows this boy looks like him.
    <br>He is carbon copy.
    <br>This is your copy.
    <br>If I'm right, let me see your hand.
    <br>So, thank you very much.
