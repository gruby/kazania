  <p>    
    <br>Christianity is a relationship.
    <br>Christianity is a relationship; it is not a religion.
    <br>Relationship exists where there is love.
    <br>Nothing will keep us on course like a deep love for the Lord.
    <br>Nothing will carry us through hardship like a sincere devotion to Christ.
    <br>Loving people is important for ministry, loving God is more important.
    <br>Using man’s natural gift for God’s work is dangerous.
    <br>It is challenging in the church today and that has reduced God’s kingdom to human knowledge.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do but the relationship we maintain
    <br>and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>What we do for God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with God.
    <br>If we want to be able to do great things, we need to have a great relationship.
    <br>Ministry does not begin with a love for people;
    <br>it begins with a love for God and that love overflows to people.
