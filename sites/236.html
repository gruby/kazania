  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>begin to release your health from that pain,
    <br>from that infirmity,
    <br>from that sickness, disease,
    <br>whatever name you call it,
    <br>release your health.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release your fluid from that pain, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release your bone from that pain, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release your muscle from that pain, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release your faculty from that pain, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be released!
    <br>Dry bones, rise again!
    <br>Let there be light
    <br>in your fluids!
    <br>Let there be light
    <br>in your muscle!
    <br>Let there be light!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet TB Joshua - Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name

    <br>Say, "My body, rejoice!"
    <br>Say, "My soul, my spirit, my heart - rejoice!"
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Good morning!"
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Good morning!"
