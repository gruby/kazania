  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the people in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Yes, only Jesus can set us free from addiction and affliction.
    <br>Let us see how it's done.
    <br>My name is Precious Benyi from Ghana.
    <br>I am into drinking and smoking. I can't deal without it.
    <br>And sometimes men would pick me, they would give me money and have fun with me.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>When I sleep, I have spiritual marriage. Help me. I am a prostitute.
    <br>I am a drunkard. Man of God, please help me. My name is Precious, I'm from Ghana.
    <br>Man of God please help me. I am into drinking and smoking.
    <br>Man of God, please help me. I can't live without drinking.
    <br>For 13 years. I was 15 years, when I got into this.
    <br>One day a man asked me for an apple, I gave him an apple.
    <br>- You drink this all the time?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- You are addicted to it?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>You want to drink it?
    <br>In the house of God!
    <br>Collect it from her.
    <br>You have been drinking it and smoking for how many years?
    <br>- Don't smoke here. 
    <br>- 13 years.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Devil. Come on. It's devil.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Leave her alone. She doesn't belong to you. She is mine.
    <br>I want to destroy her. I want to destroy her life.
    <br>She dupes people, she seduces men, after that she runs away.
    <br>Yes, I don't want her to progress.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>My name is Precious. I was addicted to smoking and drinking.
    <br>I was an international prostitute.
    <br>I started it, when I was 15 years.
    <br>It all started like this: one day on my way going to an examination for our mock, JSS mock,
    <br>I met this man, I was eating apple. And this man told me to give him one of my apples.
    <br>So when I gave him the one I had not eaten, he said
    <br>I should give me the one I had already eaten. So I gave him the one I had already eaten.
    <br>And when he left, he was just smiling.
    <br>The next thing I saw in my dreams was this man making love with me.
    <br>And when I woke up, I saw myself full of blood on the bed.
    <br>I tried to explain it to my mum. My mum was telling me it was my first time, every woman goes through this,
    <br>when she want to see her menstruation. She didn't take it seriously.
    <br>The next day, I saw myself with these friends - I was with them in school.
    <br>I wasn't spending time with them before, I didn't even go out with them.
    <br>But after this, I saw myself with them.
    <br>They came home with me. They said they want us to go to school together.
    <br>And they didn't even take me to school. We first went to a house.
    <br>One of the girls said the headmaster rented the house for her.
    <br>So they took me into the room and I asked: "What about the exams?"
    <br>She said we shouldn't bother about the exams because her boyfriend would bring it for us,
    <br>including the answers.
    <br>I was with them, they now brought out smoke, they soaked it with alcohol.
    <br>And they brought out weed, joints, cigarettes - a lot of cigarettes.
    <br>They were all smoking, they were enjoying. They forced me into it.
    <br>It wasn't easy for me to taste it, but they forced me.
    <br>I didn't smoke much but the drink I drank took over me.
    <br>First thing I saw was that I was naked on the bed.
    <br>I found out that someone had slept with me.
    <br>So I asked her: "What happened to me?"
    <br>She didn't say anything. All she was saying was that it was my first time,
    <br>and she was going to buy me drugs and I would be fine.
    <br>I didn't go home because I wasn't feeling fine and I didn't want my mum to worry.
    <br>I still kept on staying with her for the next three days.
    <br>I was drinking and smoking with them.
    <br>The next three days - we were first at the central part of my country -
    <br>we were on the way to the city and I asked about this new face in the car.
    <br>We were six girls. The new face that I saw was a very big madam.
    <br>I saw her and I asked: "Who is this woman?"
    <br>She said the woman was taking us for shopping.
    <br>But when she took us to the city, she took us to a guest house.
    <br>The next day she took us for shopping.
    <br>All the dresses she was buying for us were indecent dresses.
    <br>So the next day she took us to one man, it was a herbalist.
    <br>It's one of these native doctors, and he is a very powerful man.
    <br>The man told us to shave our private parts.
    <br>The man prepared a cream for me with my private hair that I had shaved.
    <br>The man told me that the cream was going to make me seduce men.
    <br>The man told me, the more I would drink and smoke, the more clients I would get.
    <br>I should stay away from food.
    <br>So I shouldn't eat, I should only eat meat and even if I ate meat,
    <br>it should not be cooked by a woman but a man so that I could be getting more clients.
    <br>Whenever they called me, I should use the cream on my body.
    <br>And what I would do was that I would be mostly drinking
    <br>and I would make sure I would finish one bottle in just 30 minutes.
    <br>Because when I took the bottle, I didn't drink just beer.
    <br>I would drink a strong drink, either red label, whiskey or tequila and I didn't drink in glasses.
    <br>I would just pick up the drink and put it in my mouth.
    <br>The first one I would take - I had to drink to the half level.
    <br>That was the first step. I would take it just three times.
    <br>After the second level, I had to finish it to the last level.
    <br>And the last level was when the bottle was empty.
    <br>After that I could talk to the man.
    <br>As I was drinking, the man was getting drunk but not me.
    <br>He would look at me and would be confused; whatever I told him, he would be confused.
    <br>I would tell him to go and refresh himself - even if he won't go,
    <br>he would be there; I would drape his drink, he would not even see it.
    <br>Once he took it, he would be confused.
    <br>Wherever their money was and what their plans were, they would just tell me:
    <br>"This is what I am doing,  I am even building a house. I have this money here,
    <br>I wanted to deposit it at the meeting tomorrow. They sent me this money."
    <br>He could give me the money and ask me whether he should give me all or I should take some of it.
    <br>He would even tell me to take all and keep it in my house.
    <br>And if he needed some, he would come to me and take it.
    <br>What made them to begin to say all these things?
    <br>Because I was having this chain.
    <br>I would just place it on my neck and make sure I would wear a dark dress
    <br>but it should be sexy; I wouldn't just wear anything decent.
    <br>When I went out, I would make sure the chain would be in the middle of my breast, to my heart side.
    <br>Immediately you set your eye on me, you would just follow me and you would be confused.
    <br>If you look closer at it, it's not Jesus on it.
    <br>That is our spirit.
    <br>- That is your emblem in your kingdom?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>So you mean what you are holding now is different from the cross Christians do put on?
    <br>Yes, if you look closer at it, you will see that it's not a cross.
    <br>So what is the function of this?
    <br>The function of it is to negotiate men.
    <br>I went back to the native doctor saying I was getting everything I needed but my cream got finished.
    <br>So he told me he wanted to make me more powerful and this time, I was going to target pastors.
    <br>So he collected my necklace, bracelet and put it on his shrine for just two days.
    <br>So he did a cream for me and he told me that
    <br>when I went to a church, I should make sure I didn't talk to anybody.
    <br>I should put the cream in my mouth
    <br>and put it on my face and the first person I should talk to
    <br>was the usher - before I would get to the church.
    <br>And I should make sure I would sit in the front so that the pastor was going to locate me.
    <br>I could go anytime I wanted.
    <br>Immediately I got to the church, I would tell the usher, I wanted to sit in the front.
    <br>No matter who was sitting at the front seat, she would go and remove the person and put me there
    <br>or he would go and remove the person and put me there.
    <br>And I would sit in the front. As soon as the pastor would see me - even if he was praying
    <br>or preaching - he would just concentrate on me.
    <br>Highest was 15 minutes - he would call me out.
    <br>He would just bring out a paper and a pen: "This is a quotation I want to give to you.
    <br>Then you should go through it, when you go home. This is between you and your God."
    <br>He would just write his number and tell you: "Make sure your number will come on my phone."
    <br>So I would make sure my number was going to go to his phone before I would leave the church.
    <br>Immediately he would see me leaving the church, he would leave the church
    <br>and follow me wherever I was going.
    <br>Even when the service was still going on?
    <br>Yes, even when the service was going on. I had already negotiated him.
    <br>So what would happen is that, that same day, whether he was married or he was not married,
    <br>he had to sleep with me. I negotiated them, giving them sickness
    <br>which would then put them into disgrace.
    <br>Some would be sleeping with animals. Some would be sleeping with their own children
    <br>but they didn't know because I had already negotiated them.
    <br>So the ring was for me to be disappearing.
    <br>If I disappeared and I went to a place where there was a leaf, I should just tie myself on the leaf
    <br>and I would see myself on my bed in my house.
    <br>So that was what I was doing. I got myself into a trouble one day.
    <br>I found myself getting to a place where there were no leaves.
    <br>I saw this woman coming out from mass and she removed her head tie to cover me.
    <br>It was a very big head scarf.
    <br>When you are naked and you get to somewhere in my country, they will think you are a bird, a witch,
    <br>They will kill you or they will send you to newspapers.
    <br>But whenever I got into this trouble, I would get into the hands of God's people
    <br>that would cover me and even advise me to take me out of it.
    <br>Because of the pastors I tempted and I broke a lot of homes,
    <br>a lot of people were praying against whoever was the cause of it, I was frustrated.
    <br>My master wasn't working for me anymore.
    <br>I even got attacked to remove the ring on my finger because I started seeing these short
    <br>native doctor's things; they would be dancing around me, playing drums.
    <br>Sometimes I would be confused.
    <br>Wherever I was, I acted like a mad person.
    <br>The man told me that nobody would help me and I should make sure
    <br>I would not throw this chain away because if I threw it away, I was going to be mad.
    <br>They prepared it personally for me.
    <br>Nobody was going to help me or even take all those things away for me.
    <br>But I shouldn't step my feet there again or he himself would strike me with madness.
    <br>When I was walking on the way, I saw this man - he asked me for money.
    <br>That was the last money because I didn't eat food. I would only drink and smoke.
    <br>This man said: "You're going to buy cigarettes with this money.
    <br>Give me the money and God will bless you."
    <br>I just gave him the money and he told me: "Don't bother about the money you have given me.
    <br>God has forgiven you all your sins. It wasn't you but you were negotiated.
    <br>So run to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations for your deliverance."
    <br>I just saw the man as a mad person. I left there.
    <br>After that I was not myself until I started seeing the man in my dream.
    <br>He was still telling me that I should come and see my daddy in the Lord to deliver me.
    <br>That was what brought me to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations for my deliverance.
    <br>Precious
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Precious Benyi, I am from Ghana.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations was that I was addicted
    <br>to drinking and smoking and prostitution.
    <br>And today I'm here to testify to the glory of God.
    <br>I was delivered three years ago.
    <br>God has really done a lot in my life.
    <br>I'm really grateful.
    <br>I was a prostitute, yes, and not just the cheap one on the street.
    <br>This one was executive prostitute - on ministers and big man in my country.
    <br>Today I'm very ashamed of my past.
    <br>And I will disgrace the devil today because he couldn't destroy me.
    <br>Precious
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I was a prostitute for 15 years. I was out of school when I was just in JSS2.
    <br>And this problem really destroyed me a lot in some ways because I was a problem
    <br>to my family, a disgrace to my mum and my dad.
    <br>They were even ashamed to say: "We know her, she is our family member."
    <br>But today, to the glory of God they come to me for advice.
    <br>They come to me for help. All because of the grace.
    <br>People of God, anyone watching me now in the whole world, I will tell you -
    <br>do not be ashamed to let the devil out.
    <br>My life before was very terrible. I moved from houses to houses.
    <br>A lot of women lost their husbands all because of the evil spirit in me called prostitution.
    <br>No matter who you were - if you came into my life, you would never go back to your wife.
    <br>I destroyed homes, I spoiled marriages.
    <br>I spoiled people's children. I trained girls to be prostitutes.
    <br>I gave girls to men. Moving from one house to another.
    <br>It was very terrible.
    <br>On the 6th of February 2014, I dreamt.
    <br>In the dream, men were harassing me.
    <br>And it was like I was tired, I was weak in the dream.
    <br>I just saw a man coming to me.
    <br>"Don't you know that she is my daughter, why are you harassing her?
    <br>This is just a daughter of God the demon wants to destroy."
    <br>At that time I didn't even know what Emmanuel TV was, who the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua was.
    <br>I had never seen him before. What is called man of God? I didn't even know anyone called man of God.
    <br>I saw him in my dream that 6th.
    <br>And the next year on February 6th, the same date,
    <br>I saw a woman with a sticker on the car.
    <br>She is close to our family, like a family friend.
    <br>When she saw me, I didn't even mind her. I was just standing there talking to someone,
    <br>my client who had come to pick me up in the night; we were going out.
    <br>When the woman just saw me, she said: "You, come here.
    <br>Every day you are doing all these things. Look at what you are doing.
    <br>Look at how you are standing outside. You don't even look nice. Why?
    <br>Can't you follow me to church? I'm going to church next week."
    <br>I said: "What is church?"
    <br>"I am going to see the man of God, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I was praying with him on Emmanuel TV to travel out to America.
    <br>Now the visa is on. So I'm going for testimony because I'm travelling.
    <br>So can you come with me so that you can be delivered?"
    <br>I said: "What is called deliverance? Have I told you that I'm possessed?"
    <br>I gave it to her very well on the street. She was even disgraced of herself.
    <br>But after she left, I heard a voice saying:
    <br>"Are you not the one I saw in the dream?
    <br>In the harrassment, I saved your life and today you have turned your back on me."
    <br>I just realized myself that moment.
    <br>So I called aunt Mabel and said: "Aunt Mabel, please come back."
    <br>She said: "What is it? You have insulted me and disgraced me."
    <br>I said: "Please, I'm sorry. Who is that man on your sticker I saw on your car?
    <br>She said: "He is a man of God, the one I mentioned."
    <br>I said, "I have seen him in my dreams before".
    <br>So she now came back to me.
    <br>That was why I was introduced and I even remembered
    <br>that I had seen the man of God in my dream.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Precious
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>On that fateful day I set foot in Nigeria, I said to myself: "God, You know why I am here.
    <br>I did not come here on my own but I came here through Your Spirit.
    <br>If truly You are God, deliver me out of this drinking and smoking."
    <br>To tell you the fact, the hotel I was living in - they couldn't take hold of me,
    <br>because I drank and smoked.
    <br>They would come to clean the next morning and see cigarettes.
    <br>I would be hiding it but the man working there who is a member here
    <br>said: "You, I used to see you. Is there anything you are not saying?
    <br>Because that church, if you don't say the truth, you can never be fulfilled for your deliverance.
    <br>You have to bring out all the truth so that the man of God can deliver you."
    <br>He was pampering me for me to say the truth for three days.
    <br>I then came and said: "Oga, it's true. I'm a bad girl. I came here for deliverance.
    <br>I drink, I smoke, I am a prostitute. As I'm here, I always go down there waiting for the boys to smoke.
    <br>And I can't even go to the.. Before I know it, the church time has passed.
    <br>That's why I am spending time here. I can't even enter the church."
    <br>The next Sunday he forced me to come here.
    <br>And later, on the 7th of March, the man of God delivered me; something came out of me.
    <br>Like something heavy - boom! Just like that.
    <br>I was like empty. If I was walking, I would be thinking I would fall
    <br>but it's like something heavy has gotten out of me.
    <br>I can sleep well.
    <br>Even if I sense a cigarette scent, it seems as if I want to vomit
    <br>or I want to just find somewhere where I can breathe.
    <br>I can't even breathe out.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>And I became light, very light.
    <br>I used to ask myself: "Do I have weight?"
    <br>Because I was very light that time, like a paper.
    <br>I am walking freely. I am moving freely like I am empty, like I am free.
    <br>Happy all the time.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Precious
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>After my deliverance, I had my testimony on the following Sunday,
    <br>and I was blessed with money from the man of God.
    <br>With the blessing, I did not just make use, like I did not just waste it,
    <br>because he is a man of God; I have to make him proud.
    <br>I did not use all the money. I did not change all to cedis. I left some behind.
    <br>I was using it for a business. I asked God: "What should I use this money for?"
    <br>And God revealed to me: "Go into clothing".
    <br>So I was travelling from one country to another,
    <br>bringing a lot of goods to sell, supplying some people for their shops.
    <br>That work I was doing, brought a lot of luck to me and blessing to my family.
    <br>I have been able to rent one of the biggest estates in Ghana
    <br>and I'm living as a big girl in one of the estates.
    <br>Through that work, I have been introduced as a boss -
    <br>assistant manager of Shapet Printing in Ghana.
    <br>Precious
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The advice I have for people out there listening to me right now is:
    <br>You know, when God wants to bless you, He will test your faith.
    <br>Before I could be able to stand here for a testimony,
    <br>I have really passed through [a lot].
    <br>So if you are a child of God, your faith will be tested.
    <br>That doesn't mean God is not by your side.
    <br>The living God is always by your side.
    <br>Now today I am disgraced of my past because now I see myself as a new creature,
    <br>as a new beginning of life.
    <br>I am blessed, lifted. Everywhere I go, favour is favouring me.
    <br>I have never regretted my deliverance and being a Christian.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully  for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Precious
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
