  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise His holy name!
    <br>I am meeting pastors and leaders!
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The message is not only for the pastors but also for the leaders.
    <br>And the anointing of God too!
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Book of Galatians 5:6.
    <br>Very very important.
    <br>Also 1 Corinthians 13:13.
    <br>I want to talk about this before we go into the issue why we are here today.
    <br>Which is the book of Ephesians 4.
    <br>It actually gives me sleepless nights when I see the level that Christianity is going
    <br>and we cannot differentiate the Christians from religious people.
    <br>It is difficult today to separate the Christians from religious people.
    <br>Because of our practices, we find it difficult to know who is religious and who is a Christian.
    <br>I will now take this little message 'Christianity is not a religion'.
    <br>It is not a religion.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>For Christians, Jesus actually came from above to keep the relationship and fellowship between us and God.
    <br>We don't need to go there; He came.
    <br>Just because of the relationship between you and God and our fellowship.
    <br>Christianity is not a religion but a love relationship.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>That is why many of us today, we miss it.
    <br>We practice some teachings religiously.
    <br>When I say, some teachings religiously - without a loving relationship.
    <br>It is not a loving relationship if I stand here and fail to preach love;
    <br>we would continue to cause disunity, hatred and conflict amongst the Body of Christ.
    <br>Imagine if I was here preaching hatred,
    <br>telling you that place is not good, that religion is not good. No, we are not to judge.
    <br>If we judge now, who will judge us on the last day?
    <br>If I turn to be a judge, who will judge me on the last day?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Christianity is not a religion but a loving relationship.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>It is all about, "I love you and I love God"
    <br>I love God and I love you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>When you look at your life today, you will agree with me that your life is measured by your love for God.
    <br>Your life is measured by the love you have for God and for your fellow human beings.
    <br>Faith without love is faithless.
    <br>If you have faith without love, your faith cannot work.
    <br>That is why many of us today have a hard time using our faith.
    <br>In Galatians 5:6, Paul emphatically stated that faith works by love.
    <br>If faith works by love, it means one must possess these two.
    <br>The possession of both faith and love will motivate us to love God and our fellow human beings.
    <br>Without love, no matter how big your faith is,
    <br>you will only have passion for God, desire for God and an encounter with Him.
    <br>You cannot put love as passion or desire.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Faith is faithless without love.
    <br>A person who does not love cannot be entrusted with the grace of God to heal, to deliver, to bless.
    <br>It is not possible for anyone without love to heal, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>It is not possible for anyone to deliver without love.
    <br>Because without love, it will become a personal gain.
    <br>When you don't love, you can collect money from anybody.
    <br>Even if a person is sick or dying, you would ask for money before praying for the person.
    <br>Without love.
    <br>Without love, money can come from anywhere.
    <br>Without love, you don't mind the source of money -
    <br>faith is faithless.
    <br>We ministers of God here today, I want to tell you, it is not possible.
    <br>Without the possession of both faith and love, you cannot go anywhere with God.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>You can see the hindrance you are having when using you faith.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I am taking you to the book of Ephesians for today's message.
    <br>The book of Ephesians 4.
    <br>Unity in the body.
    <br>Once again, it is all about love.
    <br>"Therefore, I, a prisoner for serving the Lord,
    <br>beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling,
    <br>a life worthy of your calling..."
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What is your calling?"
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>If you are to live a life worthy of your calling,
    <br>if that calling is from God,
    <br>the most important aspect in your life to God is love.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>If you are to live a life worthy of your calling,
    <br>and that calling is from God,
    <br>you are what you love
    <br>and your life is measured by your love to God and your fellow human beings.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Whatever your profession flows out of your relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Are you a pastor or whatever your calling flows out of your relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>If you desire greater things, you need a greater relationship.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Verse 30.
    <br>"And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit..."
    <br>Our heart is the contact point for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But the question is, "Is your heart free?"
    <br>As you are sitting, you need a free spirit.
    <br>Are you free?
    <br>Are you free from your past?
    <br>From where you are coming from?
    <br>Are you still in the present or in the past?
    <br>A free spirit is sensitive to God;
    <br>it can contact God, it can attract God.
    <br>We receive here free spirit.
    <br>Are you free?
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>"...Remember, He has identified you as His own,
    <br>guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.
    <br>Get rid of all bitterness..."
    <br>I have been to so many pastors and leaders' conferences
    <br>and I have seen the Spirit of Father descend but did not remain.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>He does not remain when He is grieved.
    <br>That the Spirit of God will not descend here today - no!
    <br>It's hundred percent guaranteed but the question is, "Will that Spirit remain in you?"
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Because of pride and arrogance - our past life. Many are still living in the past as we are talking now.
    <br>When the Spirit of Father comes, He wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>Did you know that? That is to be ungrieved.
    <br>To be ungrieved.
    <br>When He comes---
    <br>I am telling you because He is about to come now.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When He comes, He wants to be Himself in us.
    <br>That is, to be ungrieved.
    <br>Many of us are coming from falsehood, fear of failure, fear of false accusation,
    <br>longstanding grudges, unforgiving spirits.
    <br>There are so many people you cannot forgive.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When you look at the book of James 5:17,
    <br>Elijah became depressed because he was angry with God.
    <br>He was a man just like you.
    <br>Depression comes from longstanding grudges, spirit of pride, arrogance.
    <br>We pastors, you know there is no superstar in the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The spirit of competition among churches - robbing Peter to pay Paul.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Competition; we are not running a race between churches.
    <br>When the Spirit of Father comes, He wants to be Himself in you.
    <br>Are you free?
    <br>Do you have a free spirit?
    <br>Nothing bothers you at all now as you are sitting down?
    <br>Those things that bother you put your spirit in bondage.
    <br>Will T.B. Joshua touch me?
    <br>Will this man pray for me?
    <br>Will I get healed?
    <br>Will I be anointed today?
    <br>How will I get free today?
    <br>Spirit of bitterness, envy and jealousy.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>These are the things that grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He wants to remain in you and you to remain in Him
    <br>but because of all these---
    <br>The greatest battle seems to be the senses.
    <br>What you see, you desire it.
    <br>What you smell, you want to taste it.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>This is my fear now, you have to be free before I come into your midst.
    <br>You have to release yourself! Rise up and begin to release yourself!
    <br>Rise up and begin to release yourself from that spirit of bitterness, unforgiving spirit,
    <br>where you are coming from,
    <br>those things that are bothering you!
    <br>Stand up and begin to release yourself!
    <br>So that the Spirit of God can remain and you too can remain in Him.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to release yourself!
    <br>What are you worried about? 
    <br>What are you thinking about?
    <br>The Spirit of Father needs a free spirit.
    <br>Open your lips right now!
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Release me Lord!
    <br>Make me Your vessel of honour.
    <br>Release me Lord from the spirit of fear!
    <br>Fear of failure.
    <br>Fear of false accusation.
    <br>Fear of sickness and disease.
    <br>Fear of setback.
    <br>Fear of limitation.
    <br>Fear of divorce.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to release yourself! There are many fears.
    <br>Release me Lord!
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When you come Lord, I want You to be in me!
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Begin to dump all the bitterness, malice, evil speaking!
    <br>Dump them!
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Dump them - the spirit of anger, spirit of bitterness,
    <br>spirit of pride, arrogance,
    <br>malice, evil speaking!
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Mexico Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
