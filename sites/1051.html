  <p>    
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every knee shall bow!
    <br>Every tongue shall confess!
    <br>You demon, you familiar spirit,
    <br>I command you, in the name of Jesus - out!

    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>CRUSADE IN PERU WITH T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Victor Moises
    <br>18 years old
    <br>Testimony From The Peru Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I came here looking for my deliverance.
    <br>Since I was very small, I felt an attraction towards men
    <br>and after some time, when I joined a swimming class, I started dating a man.
    <br>I began to touch him and he began to touch me. We began caressing and hugging each other.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>It didn't allow me to study or concentrate and I would feel disturbed.
    <br>I was in the stands at the crusade when I started to cough and then the evil spirit in me manifested.
    <br>Then, I was carried to where the prophet was.
    <br>During the mass prayer, the evil spirit in me began to manifest.
    <br>Testimony From The Peru Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I feel much better. I thank God for my deliverance.
    <br>Now, I have peace. I thank God.
    <br>Now, after my deliverance, I no longer have affection for fellow men
    <br>because God has delivered me.
    <br>Now, I am at peace and with God's help, I will do better in my studies and will have a career.
    <br>My advice is to guard your heart, obey all of God's commandments
    <br>and don't open the door to the enemy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You for delivering me!
