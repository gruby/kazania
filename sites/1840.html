    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>I speak life to all those who are under the influence of my voice.
    <br>To those who are sick -
    <br>never a sickness, disease, affliction Jesus cannot cure, heal!
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear!
    <br>I speak life!
    <br>Let there be light, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In your marriage - let there be light!
    <br>In your career - let there be light!
    <br>In your finances - let there be light!
    <br>To your system - let there be light!
    <br>To your organs - let there be light!
    <br>Light, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Receive light, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be free, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Begin to speak to the area where there is discomfort, pain and prophetically declare healing!
    <br>Prophetically declare deliverance!

    <br>To those on the sickbed -
    <br>Your Word declares, "Be free!" in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your Word declares, "Be healed!" in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your Word declares, "Be delivered!" in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your Word declares, "Freedom!"
