  <p>    
    <br>I want to speak to your life now. When you receive it with all your heart, you are free.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Right now, talk to yourself. You can talk to yourself because a doubter is a double-minded person.
    <br>He's here; he's outside. I don't want you to be a doubter.
    <br>Remember what you said - stop doubting and believe.
    <br>Talk to yourself.
    <br>Here is the grace. Here is the hour.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, whatever you are doing at this moment,
    <br>distance is not a barrier. Just hear the Word and be under the influence.
    <br>Agree with me - Jesus loves you.
    <br>I say, "Agree with me - Jesus loves me".
    <br>You know Jesus loves you and He is concerned about you.
    <br>He wants to be involved.
    <br>If you allow Him to be involved as a mother, testimony is next.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Right now, whatever wall between you and God Almighty,
    <br>whatever weaknesses or unrighteousness...
    <br>You know yourself. As we are talking, something is telling you,
    <br>"Will God answer my prayer?" - because you know where you are coming from.
    <br>But Jesus never consults our past to determine our future.
    <br>He never consults our past to determine our present.
    <br>That is Jesus. He loves you; He is concerned about you.
    <br>He never consults our past.
    <br>It's only satan that has that information about our past and he's using it against us.
    <br>But Jesus never consults your past to determine your present.
    <br>Put it behind you. Love Him; He loves you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Every spirit, all unclean spirits operating in your life -
    <br>listen to that.
    <br>All unclean spirits operating in your life -
    <br>be it in your career, health, marriage, family, finances, business -
    <br>all unclean spirits operating in your life, I command them to leave you right now!
    <br>Right now, release yourself. Begin to command all unclean spirits operating in your life to leave you!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Let me prepare you.
    <br>I will leave you to talk. Let me get you there.
    <br>Unclean spirit is the cause and is behind those pains, that complaining.
    <br>He is responsible.
    <br>He leads people to do shameless acts.
    <br>You have been praying that you don't want to do this, and you keep finding yourself doing them.
    <br>And these are the things that are giving you trouble.
    <br>Each time you want to talk to God, you feel, "Ah, will God hear my prayer?"
    <br>because of what happened to you.
    <br>He uses all that unrighteousness, evil, sin, weaknesses -
    <br>he is using them to operate in your life.
    <br>Through those unrighteous things, he enters to operate.
    <br>These are the foolish things we are talking about.
    <br>All unclean spirits operating in your life, causing chains,
    <br>that satan is using to connect you to himself -
    <br>he is using those things to connect you to himself -
    <br>those are the chains he is using to connect you to himself, to operate and strike.
    <br>All unclear spirits operating in your life -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You know those things satan is using to operate in your life.
    <br>It could be that you talk too much. You know those acts.
    <br>Satan uses them as a chain to connect himself.
    <br>When he connects himself to you, he will now begin to drag you, drag you, drag you.
    <br>Open your lips now.
    <br>Every unclean spirit operating in your life - declare them wanted right now!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, unclean spirits operating in your life, command them out!
    <br>Say, Out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Viewers all over the world!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we want you to follow us.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier; where you are is not a barrier.
    <br>Where are you? Follow us!
    <br>You just need to be under the influence of what we are doing here.
    <br>All unclean spirits operating in your life, operating in your health,
    <br>operating in your business, operating in your career,
    <br>operating in your marriage, operating in your family,
    <br>operating in your life,
    <br>declare them right now, wanted!
    <br>I command them out!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Leave my people, you unclean spirit!
    <br>Jesus healed every infirmity.
    <br>Sickness, disease, every infirmity, submit to Jesus!
    <br>I command that infirmity, that sickness and disease, satan's curse,
    <br>I command you out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out from your blood!
    <br>Begin to command them out!
    <br>You sickness and disease - infirmity, you affliction in the blood - infirmity,
    <br>you affliction in the bones - infirmity, you affliction in the liver - infirmity,
    <br>you affliction in the kidneys - infirmity, you affliction in the blood - infirmity, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>You affliction, leave my people!
    <br>Leave their blood! Leave their kidneys!
    <br>Leave their liver! Leave their bones!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua

    <br>Freedom to you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Freedom for you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The way out for you has come!

    <br>Freedom! Freedom! To you - freedom!

    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>You can see demons manifesting and people already abide under the influence of this prayer right now.
    <br>Anywhere you are, touch your screen.
    <br>As demons are manifesting in people, people are also vomiting in different parts of the church
    <br>poisonous substances from their system.
    <br>Continue to pray.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>You can see the blood substance in what that man is vomiting.

    <br>She's my wife.
    <br>She is very very violent, very very stubborn. She doesn't listen to advice.
    <br>She is always very angry with the children. She is always molesting the children in the house.
    <br>She has a very hot temper that always makes us...
