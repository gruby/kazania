    451 - A Message Everyone MUST WATCH!!!
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Viewers, in His presence, we are strong.
    <br>I want to say "Thank you" for your time.
    <br>Wherever you are, whatever you are doing at this moment, God is aware.
    <br>Believing is our connection.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Lord Jesus - we thank You for inviting us to come and talk with You at this time.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>For some months now we have been talking about the word,
    <br>which is referred to as faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>So, we have been talking about this and it is essential, very important for the church - the word 'faith'.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let's quickly take a look at the Book of Colossians 3.
    <br>Living as those made alive in Christ - this is the topic.
    <br>I will take my reading from verse 1, and then verse 10 there.
    <br>"Since, then, you have been raised with Christ..."
    <br>Are you actually raised with Christ?
    <br>If you are raised with Christ, the life you are living is not yours.
    <br>In Him, you live; in Him, you talk; in Him, you have being.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>"Since, then, you have been raised with Christ set your hearts on things above,
    <br>where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
    <br>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."
    <br>I take it back from the beginning - it says:
    <br>"Since, then,..."
    <br>Take note of the coma; "Since" coma, "then".
    <br>"... you have been raised with Christ..."
    <br>If you are raised with Christ, the life you live is not yours.
    <br>You live in Christ, means, in Him, you move, live, talk, sit, dress and do everything.
    <br>Remember the message from the last week:
    <br>'In this world, you will have tribulation. Cheer up! I have overcome' (John 16:33).
    <br>That is, 'In Me, I will keep you safe'.
    <br>But here it says, "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ" - it means in Him.
    <br>You are in the world but you are not part of it.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Let's take our reading to verse 10.
    <br>"... put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator."
    <br>One cannot just be renewed without study and acting,
    <br>that is - it is referring to heart, of which we often talk about.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>When we refer to heart, we say Spirit.
    <br>Faith is of man's spirit.
    <br>The heart is renewed by studying and acting upon the Word.
    <br>They are talking of renewal now.
    <br>The heart - your spirit - can only be renewed by studying
    <br>and acting upon the Word of Christ.
    <br>You may read the Bible for so many years.
    <br>If you do not act it, you are not a doer - the mind is not renewed.
    <br>One may read the Bible for many years.
    <br>If he does not act it, is not a doer, the mind is not renewed.
    <br>Many Bible students are deceiving themselves
    <br>because they are not acting, living or doing the Word.
    <br>The Word is God speaking to you.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The Word is God speaking to you.
    <br>God and His Word are one.
    <br>The Word is always now.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The Word of God is always now.
    <br>I confess now; I receive now; I believe now.
    <br>If what you are here for is not now, if you don't receive now, what is the essence?
    <br>The Word is always now.
    <br>I receive now, I confess now, I believe now.
    <br>The Word of God.
    <br>Jesus is the Word.
    <br>Jesus is the living Word.
    <br>If I am not living in the presence, my enemy would have declared me,
    <br>T.B. Joshua would not be here today.
    <br>If my relationship with God is not now, you would not be here today.
    <br>Because your relationship with God is not now,
    <br>that is why you are facing life "up-down".
    <br>The Word is always now.
    <br>I receive now, I confess now, I believe now, I act now.
    <br>If Daniel's relationship with God was not now, lions would have consumed him.
    <br>If Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego's relationship with God were not now,
    <br>they would have been consumed.
    <br>If David was not now,
    <br>history would have taken over...
    <br>Now...
    <br>The Word - not in the book.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The Word of God I am talking about - not in the book, not on the written pages
    <br>but in the lips of believers.
    <br>You take your Bible, you want to sleep, you put it under the pillow, Psalm 35.
    <br>You believe when your enemy is coming - that will fight your enemy - no!
    <br>The Word - not in the book, not on the written pages but in the lips of believers.
    <br>When you enter some houses, you will see a Bible at the corridor...
    <br>The Word of God - not in the book, not on the written pages
    <br>but in the lips of believers.
    <br>What do I mean by "lips of believers"?
    <br>The more you meditate about what you read,
    <br>the more familiar you become with God.
    <br>Meditating on each Word, turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Let someone say, "Turn it over and over in your heart".
    <br>Do you know how to turn things over?
    <br>When you read your message, the Bible, turn it over.
    <br>Begin to think over it.
    <br>Read the Bible in order to live.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>- [Read the Bible in order to live.] 
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>- [Read the Bible in order to live.]
    <br>Do you know what it means?
    <br>As if your life depends on knowing it;
    <br>as if, if you don't read, you will die; as if, if you don't read, you cannot live.
    <br>Read the Bible in order to live.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "In order to live, I have to read my Bible.
    <br>If you want me to live, I have to read my Bible.
    <br>If I don't read my Bible, I cannot live."
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>As you are sitting down now, I am expecting you to begin to turn it over.
    <br>What is going on in your heart?
    <br>Begin to turn it over.
    <br>What is going through your heart?
    <br>Something - yes.
    <br>That is the picture of the Word.
    <br>Turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>I will begin to tell you about Elisha, Elijah - no, I'm not going to those,
    <br>because you need to be a Christian before you know about Elijah, Elisha.
    <br>You need to be built up spiritually.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need to be built up spiritually".
    <br>Philosophy cannot do that.
    <br>Theory about this Bible cannot build you up.
    <br>History about this Bible cannot build you spiritually.
    <br>Maybe you don't understand me.
    <br>Listen.
    <br>You are expecting me to tell you about Paul Apostle, Peter, Elijah, Elisha, Moses, John the Baptist,
    <br>Bethlehem and others - no!
    <br>History cannot build you up spiritually.
    <br>The theory about this Bible - there is theory there - history, philosophy
    <br>cannot build you up.
    <br>You can only be made spiritual by living in the Word
    <br>and by the Word living in you.
    <br>The Word builds the nature of Christ into us.
    <br>The Word dominating you is Christ's Lordship in you.
    <br>Till now, I'm still not satisfied with Faith Bracelets given to you
    <br>because you don't know the importance...
    <br>What you do reveals your character.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are you doing?"
    <br>This Faith Bracelet is to turn over and over the Word in your heart.
    <br>It is getting too late.
    <br>The moment you know it's getting too late for you to be spiritual, you get it.
    <br>You are getting late.
    <br>All what you have planned from the beginning;
    <br>you want to be this, that, be married, have children, build a house, be a graduate,
    <br>be a professor, travel all over the world...
    <br>You agree with me that it cannot solve your problem, and yet your problem is not over
    <br>because these are not the answers to your problem.
    <br>Until you are spiritual...
    <br>If you are not spiritual, you cannot have the peace we are talking about.
    <br>What you aspire to achieve always comes with peace.
    <br>Until you are spiritual you cannot be content.
    <br>Contentment is all about being spiritual.
    <br>When you are built up spiritually,
    <br>no matter how little you have, you will be content.
    <br>No matter how small or big, it is followed with contentment.
    <br>Money does not give contentment.
    <br>Fame or being a president of your nation does not.
    <br>Until you are spiritual.
    <br>To build you up spiritually, philosophy, theory on this Word,
    <br>history about this Word...
    <br>John the Baptist, twelve disciples, Peter, shadow, raised dead - they are history...
    <br>A Message Everyone MUST WATCH!!!
    <br>History, theory and philosophy of the Word cannot build you up spiritually.
    <br>This is why we keep pounding on that aspect of faith.
    <br>I will not go for all that history for you.
    <br>The Word - not in the book, not on the written page - is our contact with God.
    <br>The Word is our contact with God; it is His contact with us.
    <br>Not the Word in the book or on the written page but in the lips of believers.
    <br>No created thing is hidden from Him; all things lie open.
    <br>These is nothing you can become I give testimony about, until you are spiritual.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You can never achieve anything I will admire".
    <br>I don't admire anything.
    <br>They say, "I'm a millionaire" -
    <br>I will say, "OK, well done, millionaire".
    <br>"I'm the richest in the world" - I will say, "Well done, sir".
    <br>- "I'm the secretary general." 
    <br>- "OK, you are welcome, sir."
    <br>I don't fancy all this; until you are spiritual.
    <br>When you are spiritual, "Your honour, sir".
    <br>That is first step - achievement to God.
    <br>Every other achievement satan can...
    <br>Whatever you become can be destroyed within a second.
    <br>What you achieved so far, and you don't know what will happen next
    <br>and you cannot call your family, "Come.
    <br>Tomorrow I'm going to join Jesus Christ. Do this. This is my will. Share this way.
    <br>In the evening tomorrow I'm going.
    <br>Come, let's celebrate... Don't cry - it is a wonderful place."
    <br>And the time and day you exactly mention.
    <br>You say, "Come. Let's pray for all of you. Hold me. In Jesus' name. Amen."
    <br>He is gone.
    <br>How many in the whole world?
    <br>How many of your brothers have achieved this faith?
    <br>How many of your relatives you know that achieved this?
    <br>That is what we call "spiritual".
    <br>Someone who is related with material and immaterial world, celestial world.
    <br>But you always cry, "Oh, this has happened... What are  we going to do with this?
    <br>Yes. Debts..." - trouble.
    <br>The bank will say, "OK, this is the debt. They have to sell this property..."
    <br>This is the life you people used to.
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>When you know what you have become so far...
    <br>The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>You cannot say, "Bye bye", you cannot pray for people and share with them...
    <br>Unprepared...
    <br>This is what we need to talk about.
    <br>How to build you up spiritually.
    <br>You cannot be built up spiritually on the history of the Word.
    <br>There is history inside here.
    <br>I just tell you, "Yes, Jesus walked... Fasted 40 days, 40 nights... He made the blind see..."
    <br>Histories inside.
    <br>The Bible was given to us by inspiration.
    <br>The holy men were inspired, carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>They were not philosophers.
    <br>Whatever you become, I don't fancy or admire it.
    <br>You give testimony, I say, "OK. Glory be to God. Hallelujah."
    <br>Whatever you become; president, secretary general - without being spiritual...
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>A Message Everyone MUST WATCH!!!
    <br>A Spirit gives birth to material things.
    <br>A Spirit creates material things and you are the greatest material thing.
    <br>I'm not praying for you, I'm only telling you your position.
    <br>If a Spirit creates you and God is Spirit, what is your position?
    <br>Why are you now worshipping material instead of God?
    <br>A Spirit creates material things and you are one of the things the Spirit created.
    <br>Now, you are worshipping materials instead of God - and God is Spirit.
    <br>Materials have taken off your time.
    <br>Your quality time, your best time - you give it to materials.
    <br>When you are sick, that is when you remember to pray.
    <br>Materials have taken your quality time, best time and precious time.
    <br>You see your relationship with God as one of those things and it is the only thing.
    <br>You compare yourself with your colleague because he is richer than you.
    <br>It does not mean he is better than you.
    <br>If you are more spiritual than him, you are better than him.
    <br>We don't compare or measure our size by materials.
    <br>The best measurement is spirit, not by materials.
    <br>"This man has money, fleet of cars, a private jet, houses,
    <br>this one is a president, well known, super-star" - but you are nobody.
    <br>We don't measure ourselves by materials.
    <br>This one is very rich, and you are not rich;
    <br>if you ask him what he is going through spiritually
    <br>and compare it to what you are going through spiritually - you will give thanks to God.
    <br>I will rejoice seeing you grow spiritually.
    <br>That is my testimony.
    <br>Anybody can be rich, a president or popular but not anybody can be spiritual.
    <br>The Spirit of God gives energy and sharpness to Word.
    <br>You can speak the Word but without the Spirit of God,
    <br>your words will not be sharpened; they will lack energy or being.
    <br>I know the lesson you are taking home today is -
    <br>don't measure yourself by the materials.
    <br>That someone is richer than you does not mean he is better than you.
    <br>We Christians, we are made spiritual by living in the Word
    <br>and by the Word living in us.
    <br>If you meet whom you see as the richest, the most famous, popular, super-star, whatever -
    <br>what they are going through spiritually -
    <br>if you know it, you will never want to be like them.
    <br>Yearn to be spiritual by meditating on the Word,
    <br>turning it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Don't allow your heart to be free - meditate on each Word you read.
    <br>Turn it over and over.
    <br>A Message Everyone MUST WATCH!!!
    <br>When you are spiritual, you can be what God wants you to be
    <br>but when you are not spiritual, you can be anything.
    <br>Many are rich but that is not the will of God for them yet
    <br>because the riches they have are without peace.
    <br>You can be rich, famous and well-known without peace.
    <br>You can achieve that feat without peace and comfort
    <br>but when you are spiritual, you will become what God wants you to be.
    <br>Then, you are what God says you are, you can do what God says you can do -
    <br>when you are spiritual.
    <br>Can somebody come here and put this in summary, in nutshell -
    <br>tell me the lesson you learned.
    <br>Come forward brother.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>There is nothing you have on this earth, that does not come from God,
    <br>that was not a product of God.
    <br>Being the highest or greatest product of God Almighty you have to look up, not down.
    <br>When you are pursuing wordly things at the expense of your spiritual growth, you are going down
    <br>but when you are pursuing God at the expense of the wordly things, you are going up.
    <br>Since God is higher and He is a Maker of all things, let's go to Him
    <br>and let Him make us what He wants us to be.
    <br>But when we leave God and pursue His product, we will go down.
    <br>There is a time of crisis in any man's life.
    <br>Whether you are holy or not holy; when that crisis comes and you pursue wordly things,
    <br>those wordly things will swallow you up.
    <br>But when you pursue God and the crisis comes, like in the life of Job,
    <br>your time of safety will appear like a...
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Who else? Let me turn to this side.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>What we are taking home today, especially me, is that for you to live -
    <br>you get the life from the Word of God.
    <br>When you turn it again and again in your heart - It will give you life.
    <br>And you can create...
    <br>If that Word is in you, you can create because it is from the Spirit that we create the material.
    <br>The material came from the Spirit.
    <br>I think that is what we can take home today.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>People are conscious of their problems, not God.
    <br>To be conscious, to think, "How will I get out of this...?"
    <br>If you begin to be conscious of God,
    <br>you can never be conscious of your problems again.
    <br>Because you are conscious of your problems,
    <br>you can never be conscious of God.
    <br>When you are conscious of God, you can never be conscious of your problems.
    <br>It is not possible to be conscious of the two.
    <br>It is one thing that goes through your heart.
    <br>You will see that at the time you are thinking of joy, your achievement
    <br>and the success you make, at that moment, you forget about your failure and setback.
    <br>When the issue of failure takes over your heart and you begin to think over it,
    <br>then you forget about the success you have made.
    <br>In the same vein, when you are thinking of your problem,
    <br>you cannot also think of God -
    <br>unless you drop that problem and begin to think of God.
    <br>It is time now for you to have 'God's consciousness', instead of your problem.
    <br>When you are conscious of your problem, you are nursing fear.
    <br>And two don't go...
    <br>It is your problem and satan that go together; they are synonymous.
    <br>God and your problem cannot go together.
    <br>That shows that when you are conscious of your problem,
    <br>you are conscious of satan because your problem and satan are synonymous.
    <br>You may not know; you say you are a Christian but you may not know.
    <br>You just think, "I'm having this pain - it is paining me when I'm going to church."
    <br>If you are conscious of pain, you are conscious of satan
    <br>because he is the one responsible for it.
    <br>The same thing: when you say, "Glory be to God; they are paying me the money. I'm happy now."
    <br>If you are conscious of joy, you are conscious of God because God is behind it.
    <br>You may not know that indirectly, you are worshipping satan.
    <br>Indirectly, you are confessing satan.
    <br>That nullifies your confession of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "That nullifies your confession of God".
    <br>Indirectly, you are confessing satan, when you are conscious of your problem.
    <br>Indirectly, you are confessing satan because satan is behind your problem.
    <br>When you are conscious of your problem, that nullifies your confession of God.
    <br>What are thinking about now?
    <br>Turn it over and over.
    <br>Don't just begin to mediate on it - meditation cannot solve the problem just like that.
    <br>You have to meditate and turn it - your constancy...
    <br>When you say someone is an achiever,
    <br>it means he has been consistent in what he is doing.
    <br>It is not because he jumped once that they would say, "The man knows how to jump".
    <br>You would have to jump many times, "Yesterday he jumped well.. " -
    <br>you can see his consistency in what he is doing.
    <br>It will be too soon to say someone, "The man is wonderful".
    <br>The consistency is what we call an achiever by.
    <br>This is why the Bible says the beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>An achiever needs to pass through the valley of the shadow of death
    <br>before he can be an achiever.
    <br>We call the shadow of death a real situation.
    <br>A situation that is beyond humans - you cannot run to godfather to help you,
    <br>because it is beyond your godfather.
    <br>Only God - that is achiever, if you pass through it.
    <br>What are you thinking about?
    <br>Don't stop meditating because you are here.
    <br>After leaving here, you stop meditating
    <br>and what is happening on the outside overwhelms you; you forget your inward man.
    <br>Your inward man needs to eat in the same way your outward man eats.
    <br>The inward man eats through meditation in the Word of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"When you leave here, you will feed your outward man with food.
    <br>Don't forget your inward man needs to eat.
    <br>He eats through meditation in the Word of God."
    <br>Remember, you will feed your outward man - morning, afternoon and evening.
    <br>So, in the same vein, you have to feed your inward man - morning, afternoon and evening.
    <br>To feed your inward man - morning, afternoon and evening,
    <br>you have to turn it around - meditate over and over - to feed him constantly.
    <br>A Message Everyone MUST WATCH!!!
    <br>That is what I mean by turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Some will say, "What will I think, mediate about?"
    <br>There is a word anointed for you to flush out and to make your word sharper.
    <br>There is a word anointed for you:
    <br>'Take more of me, oh Lord and give me more of You.'
    <br>'Take more of me; give me more of You, oh Lord.'
    <br>That is what you should begin to meditate.
    <br>That is the summary of the whole Bible.
    <br>I told you that the Word built the nature of Christ.
    <br>When you say, "Take more of me" - He should take more of you.
    <br>You are more of yourself.
    <br>When you are more of yourself, it has to do with unfaithfulness, hatred, pride, greed, fruit of flesh.
    <br>That is you.
    <br>And God, fruit of the Spirit: faith, obedience, humility, kindness, goodness -
    <br>these are the things you are saying, "Take more of me" - that is my unfaithfulness,
    <br>"give me Your faithfulness" - that is what you are saying, which is the summary of the whole Bible.
    <br>"Take more of me" - that is your disobedience,
    <br>"and give me Your obedience, oh Lord."
    <br>"Take more of me" - I want you to say it aloud with me.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You, oh Lord.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>These are the words that will be turning over and over in your heart.
    <br>It is only men that have given us the summary of the message,
    <br>we have not seen any woman that would be actually challenging...
    <br>We are looking for a woman.
    <br>OK, come out, come and tell us.
    <br>What are you expecting the viewers and people who are under the influence of this message to take home?
    <br>I think so much about wordly things...
    <br>You think much about fleshly desires...
    <br>I think everyday, I need money because I want driving big cars,
    <br>but today I see something that I know there is God.
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>Clap for her again!
    <br>She is using herself as a good example.
    <br>She says before now she thought so much about fleshly desires,
    <br>"I want to have cars, build the house, travel all over the world, go around, enjoy myself",
    <br>but she says coming here today, "This T.B. Joshua is saying a different thing".
    <br>OK, let's hear mum.
    <br>Since when I was born, I didn't think about small things, all the time I thought about big things.
    <br>Even at my school everyone knew I loved big things.
    <br>Like "big" what?
    <br>I love cars...
    <br>What kind of cars?
    <br>Big cars.
    <br>Like what kind of cars?
    <br>A Message Everyone MUST WATCH!!!
    <br>My God.
    <br>I love big "something".
    <br>I like to be in the big...
    <br>Maybe I'm here and I want everybody to know me, that I'm here,
    <br>everybody to look at me, "Oh, she is a big girl", or something like that.
    <br>But today I'm happy - everything is vanity upon vanity.
    <br>What are you learning here that we should be inspired for?
    <br>Like that man who spoke first; he said that if you have money, you will die,
    <br>and if you don't have you, will also die.
    <br>What are we using ourselves for - for nothing.
    <br>You are in Europe, you are in Africa - we are all the same.
    <br>Any minute now - you can go, but today I'm happy.
    <br>Thank you very much. Clap for her.
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>She says, "Whether you have money, or you don't have, you will definitely die".
    <br>But something is clear to me.
    <br>The Bible says a man may not have money and yet be a friend of God.

    <br>The word "money" there is a parable - not this cash.
    <br>When we say "money" - people just believe in cash, coins, notes - no.
    <br>It is an idiom.
    <br>Think of every potential of life.
    <br>Your time is also money.
    <br>Your time is even more expensive then money.
    <br>No amount of money can buy our time.
    <br>Many know that their real value is gone.
    <br>We are talking about those who are enjoying their real value.
    <br>Many people are just living, they don't know what they want.
    <br>You know your good health - this health you have.
    <br>You come from home, you walk freely, you sit freely.
    <br>There are some people right now, some of the millionaires...
    <br>When you count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  - the richest in the world - they are on the sickbed.
    <br>They are saying, "God, take my money, give me good health".
    <br>Would you like to exchange your good health and collect their money?
    <br>[No!]

    <br>You have to be spiritual to understand your Creator.
    <br>A Message Everyone MUST WATCH!!!
    <br>Don't live a life of ignorance.
    <br>"I don't know, if they pay me the money.
    <br>I don't know, if this will happen to me.
    <br>I don't know, if this sickness will come like that.
    <br>I don't know, if they would sack me.
    <br>Assuming I knew they would sack me, I would get ready.
    <br>I don't know, if I would make it.
    <br>I don't know, if the man would disappoint me.
    <br>I don't know, if the woman would disappoint me.
    <br>I don't know..."
    <br>If you are spiritual, there is nothing like "I don't know".

    <br>What you are thinking about reveals your character.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are you thinking about?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour once again.
    <br>What you are thinking about reveals your character.
    <br>If you are thinking right, you are thinking about Jesus, you are thinking about what I'm saying,
    <br>and if you continue that thought - turn it over and over -
    <br>it means you have a new direction.
    <br>Look at this situation with Paul and Silas; they began to confess Jesus before their situation.
    <br>Begin to confess your God before your situation
    <br>and your situation will turn around.
    <br>What are you meditating now?
    <br>That situation - no!
    <br>Begin to confess God - the ability of God before your situation.
    <br>Honour your God before your situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Honour your God before your situation".

    <br>Right in your heart - the battle starts from your heart.
    <br>And when you don't start that battle from your heart, and the trouble goes outside,
    <br>and you begin to fight the battle - you cannot win the battle.
    <br>What is happening to you started from your heart.
    <br>Before it happened - right from your heart.
    <br>If you can fight it from your heart, you will overcome.
    <br>But when you allow the situation to come outside and you begin to run, "What can I do?" -
    <br>there is nothing you can do.
    <br>Begin to honour your God before your situation.
    <br>Honour your God before your problem and He promised to honour you.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Viewers at home - you listen to that?
    <br>Honour your God before your situation.
    <br>And where is the situation?
    <br>It is not on the outside, it is inside.
