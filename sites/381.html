  <h3>
    381 - HOW TO LIVE IN GOD’S WORD - T.B. Joshua
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>Let's continue the message about faith.
    <br>Take your Holy Bible to the Book of Galatians 5.
    <br>"Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free,
    <br>and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
    <br>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised,
    <br>Christ will profit you nothing.
    <br>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised
    <br>that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.
    <br>You have become estranged from Christ,
    <br>you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace."
    <br>I take you to the proof text.
    <br>Galatians 5:18
    <br>"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>THE WORKS OF FAITH PART 4
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The unrenewed mind is always waging war against unbelief.
    <br>I'm talking to you.
    <br>Let me speak what is going in your heart and what is happening to you everyday.
    <br>You confess faith - I am a faith man, I have faith in God - denying it in action.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You confess faith in the Word, denying it in action.
    <br>You say, "I'm a faith man, I have faith in God..." -
    <br>it means you have faith, you have no work.
    <br>Faith without works is dead.
    <br>You are confessing faith in the Word, denying it in action;
    <br>trying to believe, yet never acting on the Word.
    <br>"Oh my God. Yes, it happened to that man; this testimony is so great. I'm having similar problem.
    <br>The man came out to testify. This shows my problem will be over today."
    <br>Because you have seen someone confessing or testifying;
    <br>that is what you base your healing on.
    <br>That is the basis of your healing, that the man said, "I have headache" -
    <br>after ministering the anointing water the headache disappeared.
    <br>"I too, I have a headache. I know when I get that anointing water, my headache..." -
    <br>that is what you base your healing on.
    <br>Trying to believe, yet never acting on the Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Trying to believe, yet never acting on the Word.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Trying to believe, yet never acting on the Word.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Trying to believe, yet never acting on the Word.]
    <br>Trying to believe, yet never acting on the Word of God.
    <br>God does nothing without His Word.
    <br>"I have seen it happened, I have heard so many testimonies" -
    <br>it is senses knowledge evidence.
    <br>That was alright in the early church but it is not alright in the churches today.
    <br>Paul continued in Galatians 5:19.
    <br>Now, the works of the senses, the work of the flesh are made manifest.
    <br>He gives a long list of them.
    <br>We are all familiar with it.
    <br>When you read it through, you see this long list of those things Paul gave.
    <br>We are all familiar with it.
    <br>This, that...
    <br>But in verse 18...
    <br>If you are led by the recreated Spirit, you are not under the law.
    <br>Galatians 5:18 gives a very graphic picture of the senses and of the Spirit.
    <br>The word "flesh" should have been translated as "senses", so you would understand it better.
    <br>Don't get yourself confused; when you see "flesh", put "senses" - when you see "senses" put "flesh",
    <br>so, you will quite understand it.
    <br>HOW TO LIVE IN GOD’S WORD - T.B. Joshua
    <br>What we call the sins of the flesh are the sins of the senses.
    <br>Don't get yourself confused; it is the same meaning; "flesh" - "senses".
    <br>I mentioned five senses.
    <br>There is no way we can go into details without mentioning these five senses
    <br>because all are physical doors that lead to the brain.
    <br>Smelling, tasting, hearing, seeing, feeling
    <br>are all physical doors that lead to the brain.
    <br>They are all seen connected with the physical body.
    <br>This body of ours is the laboratory where we have learned all we know of secular knowledge.
    <br>This body is the laboratory where we have learned all we know of secular knowledge.
    <br>You know what I mean by 'secular knowledge'?
    <br>That is gift, talent.
    <br>I was giving you a good example about senses.
    <br>I know this thing is hard because I struck it.
    <br>As unbelievers, without hitting, I would still doubt whether it is hard or not,
    <br>is it iron or what - that are unbelievers, those who live under senses, knowledge.
    <br>"Is it iron, or what" - they want to touch it as someone who is led by senses.
    <br>"Oh, I know; it is hard, because I hit it."
    <br>"I know it is sweet, very sweet because I tasted it" - because you live under that.
    <br>You demand to see because you live by the senses.
    <br>That is your life.
    <br>You demand to see because you live by the senses.
    <br>HOW TO LIVE IN GOD’S WORD - T.B. Joshua
    <br>It is fragrant because I smell it.
    <br>Your spirit must govern your senses.
    <br>To conquer, your spirit must govern your senses.
    <br>How?
    <br>Your mind must be so renewed by knowing the Word and acting on it.
    <br>There are Word hearers, mere listeners, good talkers but not doers.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>There are Word hearers, mere listeners, good talkers but not doers.
    <br>You see, "... Jesus is Lord! Yes! Amen!" - good talker.
    <br>You see, my brother would listen, "Yes, yes" - mere listener, but not doer.
    <br>The battle that we fight in our daily work is with our senses.
    <br>That is the battle.
    <br>The battle that we fight in our daily work is with our senses.
    <br>That is the battle.
    <br>I want the things I see.
    <br>I may eat it, I may drink it and I may feel it.
    <br>That is the battle.
    <br>Listen to our Lord, Jesus Christ here, in the Book of John 11:39.
    <br>"Jesus said, 'Take away the stone.'
    <br>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, 'Lord, by this time
    <br>there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.' "
    <br>... and you are asking me to remove the stone.
    <br>Imagine a body that had been dead four days.
    <br>Now, when you go to the verse 14,
    <br>"Jesus said to her, 'Did I not say to you that if you would believe
    <br>you would see the glory of God?' "
    <br>What does this mean to you?
    <br>What Jesus asked Martha here - He asks of all who desire to see the glory of God;
    <br>He asks of all who desire to see the goodness of God;
    <br>we must believe that we will see.
    <br>We do not see first, then believe.
    <br>We believe first, then see.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Faith comes before sight.
    <br>When you take a look at the Book of Psalms 27:13...
    <br>"I would have lost heart unless I had believed
    <br>that I would see goodness of the Lord."
    <br>What 'lost heart' means - despair.
    <br>If you cannot believe that you would see the goodness of God, you would despair.
    <br>The thing that keeps us from despairing is not what we see but what we believe.
    <br>Like I have said at the beginning,
    <br>in Galatians 5:18, Paul gives us a very graphic picture
    <br>of the senses and of the Spirit.
    <br>Let's talk of the Spirit now.
    <br>The new kind of knowledge.
    <br>Let someone say, "The new kind of knowledge."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Remember the commandment in John 13:34,
    <br>love your neighbour as yourself, which is the greatest.
    <br>We have a new kind of knowledge - revelation knowledge.
    <br>Let someone say, "Revelation knowledge".
    <br>It comes by revelation, not by senses.
    <br>I carry it to know the weight, "Oh yes, I can carry it with my hand" - that are senses.
    <br>How? Because I carried it.
    <br>But by revelation, I can tell you the weight of this thing without carrying it.
    <br>We have a new kind of knowledge - revelation knowledge.
    <br>Let someone say.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Look, good example again.
    <br>If I live under the senses, I need to know how many people can carry this.
    <br>"Yes, I can push it" - because I pushed it to know the weight.
    <br>But, by revelation, I will tell you the size and weight.
    <br>We have a new kind of knowledge - revelation knowledge.
    <br>It is spiritual.
    <br>It is knowledge that has come to us by acting on the Word and living in it.
    <br>You want to say, "How come you are able to see vision, prophecy?
    <br>How come you know this man will be healed, and you say 'In the name of Jesus - be healed'?
    <br>How come you know this man is a wizard, witch? How come? Is it just coming from heaven?
    <br>How does this come?"
    <br>But you live by senses, you demand to see because you live by the senses.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus" - you pray by idea, by imagination.
    <br>Because you see people praying, you too, you pray.
    <br>You don't know whether the person is sick or not, whether God is answering you or not,
    <br>you don't know whether they are witches or wizards, you don't know the sickness they have,
    <br>you cannot say much about it.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Spirit prayer demands for revelation.
    <br>But when you practise prayer, you read books, confess Jesus,
    <br>denying Him in action.
    <br>By revelation, it is spiritual.
    <br>It is knowledge that comes to us by acting on the Word and living in it.
    <br>We do the Word, live the Word, act the Word and trust implicitly in the Word.
    <br>We know God and His throne are backing up every Word.
    <br>This gives a quiet and restful confidence.
    <br>We have talked about senses.
    <br>Now, as children of God...
    <br>The say someone is a pastor, bishop, Christian...
    <br>You are a Christian by revelation.
    <br>You can only become a Christian by revelation;
    <br>you can only become a pastor by revelation.
    <br>This revelation, like I have said, is spiritual.
    <br>It is knowledge that has come to us by acting on the Word and living in the Word.
    <br>We do the Word, act the Word, live the Word and trust implicitly in the Word.
    <br>We know God and His throne are backing up every Word.
    <br>This gives us a quiet and restful confidence.
    <br>Like I have said, in Galatians 5:18, Paul gives a very graphic picture
    <br>of the senses and of the Spirit.
    <br>We talked a little about the senses, now back to the Spirit.
    <br>Your mind cannot be renewed by studying the Word only.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your mind cannot be renewed by studying the Word only."
    <br>And you know how today we study the Word.
    <br>We have the great PhD on the Bible - only that cannot make us pastors or Christians.
    <br>Listen to what I said.
    <br>You must do the Word, live the Word, act the Word
    <br>and trust implicitly in the Word because
    <br>God and His throne are backing up every Word.
    <br>This gives us a quiet and restful confidence.
    <br>The Word must become part of your very being because it lives in us - the Word of God.
    <br>Just as our blood is a part of us; just as our muscles are a part of us,
    <br>so the Word must become an integral part of you.
    <br>Can you separate from your muscles?
    <br>Just as your muscles are a part of you; just as your blood is a part of you,
    <br>so the Word must become an integral part because it lives in us.
    <br>I hope your faith is lifted up.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I salute you.
