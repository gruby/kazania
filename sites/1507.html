  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Greet the next person beside you, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Emmanuel to you all, in Jesus' name!
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We have listened to wonderful, live transforming testimonies
    <br>but we are here to listen to testimonies of someone sharing what God has not done yet.
    <br>Today, we listened to testimonies of the goodness of God
    <br>but I have not seen someyone testifying of what he has not received yet.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>My name is Yinka.
    <br>In times of our great need, many tend to wish they could actually see Jesus,
    <br>touch Him and hear His Word.
    <br>Brethren, a physical appearance will not make Jesus any more real to us
    <br>than He is now because He can be present at all times through His Word and by His Spirit.
    <br>Satan raises doubts within man and causes man to forfeit peace with God.
    <br>Many are going through issues that cause conflict in their hearts.
    <br>Many question what kind of Christians they are.
    <br>Having been born again for years, they say, "I've given my entire life for Christ
    <br>but still struggle with the harsh realities of life."
    <br>There are more questions than answers.
    <br>This has caused man to be rebellious by nature.
    <br>In the Book of Genesis 3, the Bible makes us understand that
    <br>satan tempted Eve to doubt the goodness of God.
    <br>Satan made Eve focus only on what she did not have.
    <br>In the Book of Genesis 3, satan tempted Eve to doubt the goodness of God.
    <br>Satan made Eve forget all that God had given her and instead focus on what God had forbidden.
    <br>We all know the story of Adam and Eve.
    <br>The Bible says her desperate craving eventually brought them out of the Garden of Eden.
    <br>She was only focusing on what God had forbidden, neglecting all that God had given her.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many Christians today are struggling with the same problem.
    <br>Rather than focusing on the countless blessings God has given man,
    <br>we are busy craving for what we do not have.
    <br>Brethren, any time you are feeling so sorry for yourself for what you do not have,
    <br>consider all you do have and thank God.
    <br>I know you have been thinking a lot about what you want God to do for you.
    <br>Any time you are feeling so sorry for yourself for what you do not have,
    <br>please consider all you do have and thank God.
    <br>I remember the days I used to be worried about this and that - I would cry.
    <br>I remember one of those occasions when my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua met me and said,
    <br>"Why are you crying? Why are you worried about tomorrow?
    <br>Thank God for what God has done!"
    <br>And I realised that that was a temptation of the devil.
    <br>Each time you feel so sorry for yourself for what you do not have,
    <br>consider all you do have and thank God.
    <br>If you do not thank God for what you have,
    <br>you may be slipping into unhealthy doubt.
    <br>Brethren, today many find themselves in that desperate craving,
    <br>when the answer to their prayers seems to delay in coming.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing,
    <br>don't doubt your faith but doubt your doubts because they are unreliable.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Doubt your doubts for they are unreliable."
    <br>This brings me to the title of this message:
    <br>YOUR DOUBTS ARE UNRELIABLE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your doubts are unreliable."
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that
    <br>God wants to answer prayers but very often we ask for the wrong things -
    <br>for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>We fail to realise that our relationship with God is founded upon God's mercy and favour.
    <br>At this point in time I will quickly demonstrate the working of a man's heart
    <br>and I believe you will see yourself in this demonstration.
    <br>At this point in time I need three volunteers.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>I would like to quickly demonstrate the working of a man's heart
    <br>and I believe that we all are going to see ourselves clearly.
    <br>Please, I need three volunteers; one from here, one from here...
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>You can come.
    <br>Just three persons, quickly, to illustrate this message.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Our brother here is going to have what God has given each and every one of us,
    <br>which is the gift of life.
    <br>Now, my brother - you come to this side.
    <br>Just stand there and face this side.
    <br>And we have these two gentlemen here.
    <br>My brother here will have a car,
    <br>and my brother here will have promotion.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Now, we have three persons here who want to help us to understand
    <br>how satan has been tempting man from running the straight race with God.
    <br>Now we have our gentle brother here.
    <br>You see, God Almighty has given each and every one of us the gift of life.
    <br>On his walk, he was tempted to look to the other side and he saw a car,
    <br>which he did not have.
    <br>He began to pursue the car.
    <br>He forgot about the gift of life.
    <br>He began to pursue the car.
    <br>He began to run, pray, fast, yet, failed to get it.
    <br>While tracing the car, as a man, he was tempted to look to the other side,
    <br>and he saw promotion.
    <br>He began to chase after this too.
    <br>Yet, he was unable to get either of them and he was worried.
    <br>He began to lament, question his sonship.
    <br>He felt so cheated as a Christian, "I have been born again. What happened? Why?
    <br>I'm praying. Things are not working out."
    <br>At this point in time, viewers all over the world, it is fast and easy for satan to get him to his side
    <br>through his doubts.
    <br>Because all satan wants is for him to forget about the gift of life
    <br>and only focus on the car and promotion he does not have.
    <br>Surely, promotion and car are good things to have
    <br>but satan wants him to raise his needs above God
    <br>and make the material things his gods.
    <br>Brethren, satan may tempt one to doubt the goodness of God
    <br>because once he realises that you have begun to question your sonship
    <br>due to your own unpalatable situations,
    <br>you are fast and easily moving each day of your life towards satan.
    <br>And any time you are dealing with doubt, be aware that you are in a weak position,
    <br>vulnerable, I mean, exposed to temptation.
    <br>Any time you are feeling so sorry for what you do not have,
    <br>you are thinking about unanswered prayer, you are dealing with doubt,
    <br>at that point you are weak, vulnerable, I mean, exposed to temptation.
    <br>The same happens to our marriages, possessions, positions.
    <br>Many find a man or woman they want to marry
    <br>because they have discovered certain qualities.
    <br>After one or two years, you find another relationship, another woman, another man
    <br>with different qualities and you begin to crave for it.
    <br>You abandon the previous relationship.
    <br>Perhaps you see someone with the latest of the latests cars.
    <br>After three months, maybe he attends a party and he sees another car
    <br>and he begins to crave for it.
    <br>God wants to answer prayers but very often we ask for the wrong things.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God wants to answer prayers but very often we ask for the wrong things."
    <br>Thank you very much, brothers, you have blessed us.
    <br>You can go to the altar and take the fruits.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Do not let your unanswered prayers cause you to doubt
    <br>the fulfilment of God's promises for your life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again, "Your doubts are unreliable."
    <br>The Book of Matthew 6 - that will be our first proof text for today's message.
    <br>I will quickly take this reading from verse 25.
    <br>"Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink;
    <br>nor about your body, what you will put on.
    <br>Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?
    <br>Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns;
    <br>yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
    <br>Are you not of more value than they?"
    <br>Verse 30:
    <br>"Now if God so clothes the grass of the field,
    <br>which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
    <br>will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
    <br>Therefore do not worry, saying,
    <br>'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
    <br>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
    <br>and all these things shall be added to you.
    <br>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things..."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your doubts are unreliable."
    <br>Many people today do not pray because they are frustrated in their faith.
    <br>Their hope for an answer has been shattered too often; they have given up.
    <br>People in the Bible whom we consider to be pillars of faith also had some moments of doubt.
    <br>This does not mean they had less faith but that their faith was being challenged in a new way.
    <br>But do you know their doubts moved them closer to God, not further away from God.
    <br>In the Book of Matthew 14:28, the Bible says
    <br>when the disciples saw Jesus walking on the sea, they were terrified.
    <br>But Peter said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come," and Jesus said, "Come".
    <br>The Bible says that Jesus commanded Peter to come.
    <br>Peter was focusing on Jesus
    <br>and the Bible says he experienced an unusual demonstration of God's power.
    <br>He began to walk on the sea
    <br>but the moment he took his eyes off Jesus, he doubted and he began to sink.
    <br>In Numbers 11:21, Moses, who had once witnessed God's power in spectacular miracles,
    <br>also doubted God's ability to feed the wandering Israelites.
    <br>... when you read that Book of Numbers 11:21.
    <br>So also Gideon in the Book of Judges 6:37.
    <br>Gideon, one of the pillars of faith, also had some moments of doubt.
    <br>He used doubts to pose the question, get an answer and push for a decision.
    <br>The Bible says he said to God,
    <br>"If truly You want to use me as You promised to rescue Israel, then prove to me; show me a sign."
    <br>All these heroes of faith had moments of doubt
    <br>but the Bible says their doubts strengthened their desire and determination for God.
    <br>Is your own doubt oftentimes strengthening your desire and your determination for God?
    <br>Brethren,
    <br>we are in perilous times, times too difficult to deal with.
    <br>Satan keeps using our weakness of doubt to trap us from running the straight race with God.
    <br>Satan keeps using the unrighteousness of man as a material for his own purpose.
    <br>When satan realises that doubt is your weakness, he will always use doubt against you.
    <br>When he realises that doubt is your weakness, he will always use doubt against you.
    <br>Doubt is not to overcome us
    <br>but to sharpen our minds and strengthen our relationship with God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Doubt is not to overcome you but to sharpen your mind and strengthen your relationship with God.
    <br>Brethren,
    <br>in the case of prolonged, uncomfortable situations,
    <br>one may be tempted to doubt God's ability to help
    <br>but always remember that doubt was never meant to be a permanent condition,
    <br>otherwise we would be doomed to destruction.
    <br>But when doubt comes, I urge you to deal with it at the early stage.
    <br>When doubt comes, deal with it at the early stage.
    <br>What is your situation? What is causing you to doubt God's ability to put you over?
    <br>Always remember that satan's tactic and strategy is to get you to doubt the goodness of God.
    <br>He always wants you to think and talk about what you do not have,
    <br>forgetting about what God has done in the past.
    <br>However, when you are busy thinking, talking about what you do not have,
    <br>you may be slipping into unhealthy doubt.
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>Remember that satan takes delight in inflicting pain on people.
    <br>His aim is to push us from our position as Christians, to cut off our dependence on God.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing, don't throw away your faith
    <br>just because God does not resolve your doubts immediately.
    <br>At God's time everything looks beautiful.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't throw away your faith
    <br>just because God does not resolve your doubts immediately."
    <br>At God's time everything looks beautiful.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After you have prayed and fasted, you long to receive a promotion but instead you were sacked.
    <br>Or, you had expected a huge breakthrough, but instead you were chased,
    <br>or you were bypassed.
    <br>Always remember that there is nothing that the devil may try to bring against you
    <br>that can be greater than Jesus.
    <br>There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that the devil may try to bring against you
    <br>that can be greater than Jesus.
    <br>You can be sure that you are an overcomer
    <br>because the One who overcomes lives inside of you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The One who overcomes lives inside of me."
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, whatever satan is using to cause you to have doubts,
    <br>as from today shall begin to lead you to faith, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I know satan is a cunning man;
    <br>his aim and desire is to push us away from running the straight race with God.
    <br>Whatever satan is using to cause you to have doubt,
    <br>as from today it shall strengthen your desire and determination for God, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Whatever satan is using to cause you to have doubt -
    <br>be it in your health, your finances, your career, your destiny -
    <br>as from today it shall continue to move you closer to God, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Whatever satan is using, viewers all over the world, to trap you to himself,
    <br>that situation shall begin to yield to your prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Brethren, always take courage from those heroes of faith who had fought the good fight of faith,
    <br>finished their race and kept their faith.
    <br>They became heroes because they soon realised that doubts are unreliable.
    <br>They overcame because they soon realised that their doubts were unreliable.
    <br>Finally brethren, let's quickly turn our Bibles to the Book of Mark.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Book of Mark 8 and let us take our reading from verse 17.
    <br>Let us hear what Jesus said to the people
    <br>when He realised that they were struggling with doubts after witnessing so many miracles.
    <br>They had seen how God used Him to wrought miracles yet they still doubted God's ability.
    <br>Now, let's listen to the Book of Mark 8:17:
    <br>"Jesus... said to them,
    <br>'Why do you reason because you have no bread?
    <br>Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart still hardened?
    <br>Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?
    <br>And do you not remember?
    <br>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand,
    <br>how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?'
    <br>They said to Him, 'Twelve.'
    <br>'Also, when I broke the seven for the four thousand,
    <br>how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up?'
    <br>And they said, 'Seven.'
    <br>So He said to them, 'How is it you do not understand?' "
    <br>After seeing all those miracles, signs and wonders,
    <br>looking back to see what God has done in your life,
    <br>how then you do not understand that He so much cares about every little thing in our lives?
    <br>It is God's desire to answer our prayers but don't forget, we oftentimes ask for the wrong thing.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, those who are under the influence of my voice,
    <br>what is causing you to doubt the fulfilment of God's promise for your life today?
    <br>I mean, what is that situation that is challenging your faith?
    <br>Let that situation move you closer to God, not further away from God.
    <br>When you are struggling with doubt, don't settle with it.
    <br>What is causing you to doubt God's ability to put you over?
    <br>Is it rejection, isolation, failure, barrenness
    <br>or your long-time petition or prayer request despite your efforts?
    <br>Always remember,
    <br>whenever it seems it has all run out, that is in fact when life has just begun.
    <br>Whenever it seems that there is no hope, no future, no answer,
    <br>you do not even know what life or tomorrow may bring forth,
    <br>that is in fact when life has just begun.
    <br>Don't throw away your faith just because God does not resolve your doubts immediately.
    <br>I want you to always remember that doing impossible things is everyday business for God.
    <br>Doing impossible things - what no man can comprehend, what no man can think about -
    <br>is everyday business to God.
    <br>Your big problem won't seem impossible if you can be patient
    <br>and let God answer your question on His own schedule, not yours.
    <br>Be patient.
    <br>If you are dealing with doubt, remember that you are always in a weak position,
    <br>vulnerable, exposed to temptation.
    <br>Are you in need of healing, deliverance, blessings?
    <br>As you search for answers, protect yourself by meditating on the unshakable truth of God's Word.
    <br>And I want to leave you with one thought in mind:
    <br>The best antidote, remedy, for doubts is for you to reflect over God's track record in your life.
    <br>Think about how God has pulled you through the storms of life,
    <br>how He has walked you through the valley of the shadow of death
    <br>and that will grow confidence that He will do it in your present situation.
    <br>Look back and see His countless blessings - they are uncountable; they are numerous.
    <br>If you look back and see all those blessings that God has given you,
    <br>that will give room for praise.
    <br>Remember you were once a tiny embryo.
    <br>We were all once a tiny embryo.
    <br>See what we are today.
    <br>You look at yourself, I look at myself.
    <br>That gives confidence that He will do it again and again.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart.
    <br>Say, "My heart, listen to the voice of God."
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
