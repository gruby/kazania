    <br>A lot has been said by people concerning how the church,
    <br>'Synagogue' came into being.
    <br>Some people questioned my foundation, my mentor,
    <br>my educational background and my calling as a man of God.
    <br>I am not showing this documentary because people questioned
    <br>my foundation, my background, my mentor,
    <br>my educational background, my calling as a man of God.
    <br>I am showing it because it is God's time.
    <br>That is, it is an act of God.
    <br>Stay blessed and watch.
    <br>This is my story
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>This is Prophet T.B. Joshua at the prayer mountain.
    <br>Guided by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua came to this prayer mountain to seek the face of God.
    <br>Like prophets of old, he fasted and prayed for 40 days and 40 nights,
    <br>as prayer and fasting opens the door for God to enter.
    <br>It was at this very prayer mountain
    <br>that Prophet T.B. Joshua received divine anointing from God to start his ministry.
    <br>As he raised his hand to Heaven and then fell, prostrating to pray,
    <br>he received a covenant from God concerning his calling.
    <br>Only he and God know the divine message that was revealed to him at that moment.
    <br>Concerning this experience, Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "I was in a trance for three consecutive days.
    <br>Then, I saw a hand that pointed a Bible to my heart and the Bible entered my heart.
    <br>And my former heart immersed with the Bible immediately.
    <br>Then, the awareness came and I saw the apostles and prophets of old
    <br>with someone who I could not see his head
    <br>because he was tall to the Heaven and suspended
    <br>which I believe was our Lord Jesus Christ sitting in their midst.
    <br>I also saw myself in their midst.
    <br>After a while, I saw a hand of the same tall man.
    <br>I could not behold his face which was glittering with an unimaginable light.
    <br>But other apostles I could see their faces, particularly Apostles Peter and Paul,
    <br>Prophets Moses and Elijah, and others.
    <br>Their names were boldly written on their chest.
    <br>I heard a voice saying, "I am your God.
    <br>I am giving you a divine commission to go and carry out the work of the Heavenly Father".
    <br>At the same time, the same hand of the tall man gave me a small cross
    <br>and a big Bible - bigger than the one that entered my heart -
    <br>with a promise that as I keep pressing in His time and name, I will be given a bigger cross.
    <br>But if I fail, the opposite would occur.
    <br>I also heard a voice of the same tall man - I could not see his head -
    <br>saying, "I am the Lord your God, who was and who is, Jesus Christ,
    <br>giving orders to all the apostles and prophets".
    <br>The same voice said to me, "I would show you the wonderful ways, I would reveal myself through you
    <br>in teaching, preaching, miracles, signs and wonders for the salvation of souls".
    <br>Since then, I have been receiving in my vision every year according to my faithfulness to God, a bigger cross.
    <br>That means to me more responsibilities.
    <br>The Bible that entered my heart symbolised Spirit and life, the Holy Spirit.
    <br>God's Word is Spirit and life. He does nothing without His Word.
    <br>The Book of Romans 8:16 says:
    <br>"God's Spirit joins Himself to our spirit to declare that we are children of God".
    <br>This divine anointing is performed by God Himself
    <br>on all who have the wonderful privilege of becoming His children.
    <br>It accompanies the conversion of those who trust in Christ.
    <br>Paul said that the Spirit indwells every believer
    <br>and His presence is the guarantee of our future glory in Heaven,
    <br>according to the Book of 2 Corinthians 1:21-22.
    <br>As a result of this indwelling presence, we have the ability to become more like Christ
    <br>in accordance with 2 Corinthians 3:17-18.
    <br>We who are born of God have no excuse of remaining as we are.
    <br>We can be increasingly conformed to the image of Christ
    <br>by yielding ourselves to God's anointing, the Holy Spirit, who dwells in our hearts.
    <br>Father, thank You for Your Spirit.
    <br>Fill us with His love and power.
    <br>Change us into Christ's own image day by day and hour by hour.
    <br>Remember, the Father gave us the Spirit to make us like His Son.
    <br>These are the pictures you will bring out and show people.
    <br>By the time the glory of God is revealed to the world and other countries start coming,
    <br>at that time, I will not have the time to come here again.
    <br>The man of God said that by the time the glory of God is revealed in his ministry
    <br>and people from other countries start coming,
    <br>he will no longer have the time to visit this prayer mountain.
    <br>And that in the future, he will have his own prayer mountain.
    <br>This is a picture of Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for people
    <br>after just having returned from a 40 day and 40 night fast at the prayer mountain.
