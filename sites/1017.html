    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Somebody scream!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is something that makes me come into Your presence
    <br>My Helper
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come on!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As we continue to relax
    <br>In Your precious arms
    <br>Holy Ghost
    <br>As we continue to relax
    <br>In Your precious arms
    <br>Holy Ghost
    <br>Come on! The best is yet to come.
    <br>The best is yet to come
    <br>Always
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The atmosphere is charged now.
    <br>So before we begin to pray, if I may quickly remind you once again:
    <br>We believe 10 million people will have moved to the hospital, to the orphanage home,
    <br>all over the world to the less privileged, to the physically challenged.
    <br>Please move.
    <br>Bless people with your love.
    <br>Bless people with your care, your money, whatever God has given to you - move!
    <br>There are some troubled nations.
    <br>People that have access to go there, you need faith to bless people.
    <br>You can't just go on your own, "Hey, I have millions of dollars".
    <br>You need faith to bless people.
    <br>If that blessing is for God, you are blessing them - through them to God.
    <br>So you have to pay some price.
    <br>Apart from giving, you need grace to do it.
    <br>People are moving all over the world as I'm talking.
    <br>People are moving blessing people, giving a kiss to the old people.
    <br>Give them love and tell them, "Look, Jesus loves you".
    <br>Someone is waiting for you. Tell your neighbor to rescue them.
    <br>Someone is waiting for you, to pay their house rent.
    <br>Someone is waiting for you, for feeding.
    <br>Someone is waiting for you, for good health.
    <br>Someone is waiting for you, for freedom.
    <br>Someone is waiting for you, for blessing.
    <br>Someone is waiting for you, for reconciliation.
    <br>Not just because of my birthday.
    <br>My birthday just brought that awareness.
    <br>It is what you are supposed to be doing.
    <br>That is the life God designed for you because you are an angel -
    <br>angel of God to give love;
    <br>angel of God to give blessing;
    <br>angel to give more healing, deliverance.
    <br>You have not been doing this.
    <br>You have been looking at the face to do.
    <br>"This one hates me, I won´t give. This one loves me, let me give." No!
    <br>If you are an angel of God, you don't look at the face.
    <br>"This one loves me, this one is my family, I will give."
    <br>"This one hates me - no, no, no, I don't want to hear anything."
    <br>"This one is keeping malice. No."
    <br>No!
    <br>Love your neighbor as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbor could be your enemy,
    <br>your neighbor could be those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Love them all.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Father, we ask for sanctification.
    <br>Sanctify us, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Right now, be open. Come out.
    <br>God is not a man.
    <br>Be open.
    <br>He is not a man.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Be open.
    <br>God is not a man.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>How do you open?
    <br>To be open is to mean what you are saying.
    <br>Don't just begin to talk. You must mean what you are saying.
    <br>It is time to reconcile.
    <br>What you cannot tell man, tell God.
    <br>Here I am; use me.
    <br>Here I am; send me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Yes, I give a warning.
    <br>This is warning, red card to the evil spirit right now.
    <br>Come out!  I say out!
    <br>You evil spirit, leave my people!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Today, satan is under your foot.
    <br>You know it; I know it.
    <br>The cause of sickness - under your foot!
    <br>The cause of disappointment - under your foot!
    <br>The cause of setback - under your foot!
    <br>The cause of disease - under your foot!
    <br>The cause of nightmare - under your foot!

    <br>No affection in the marriage!
    <br>Who is the cause?
    <br>I´m the one. I've said I will not talk.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>I entered her since childhood.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Open your lips and say to the devil: I know you; you are a killer!
    <br>I know you; you are a destroyer!
    <br>I know you; you are a thief!
    <br>I command you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Kick! Begin to kick the devil out!
