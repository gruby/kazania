  <p>    
    <br>We want the Lord to expose among us those spirits that kill, steal and destroy.
    <br>Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Say, out!
    <br>When the fire of the Holy Ghost fell during the mass prayer of the first service,
    <br>arresting many who are possessed by evil spirits, was this man.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the second service, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, furthered his deliverance
    <br>with a prophetic revelation.
    <br>Let us listen to the prophecy and its confirmation.
    <br>I see the involvement of a human being to make a charm
    <br>and that charm has become a demon.
    <br>It is in your house as I'm talking now.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>My name is Tony.
    <br>When I had a problem, I was initiated with a concotion.
    <br>The concotion comes to meet me every night in Lagos here.
    <br>It comes like a human being, calling my name and speaking with me
    <br>like a human being.
    <br>He will tell me what he wants, telling me that he needs such and such things.
    <br>I should bring them for him and I would do that.
    <br>The reason why he is running now is that he is afraid; they are getting very close to him.
    <br>He abandoned the house and he is now looking for somebody who can save him.
    <br>The demon is chasing him.
    <br>The concotion has become a human being.
    <br>It appears to you?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Physically?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>One of the reasons God gives us His power is to confirm that
    <br>we are speaking for Him.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Following the prophetic message given to Mr Anthony Nnemeka last Sunday,
    <br>the man of God gave him Anointing Water and instructed him in the name of Jesus
    <br>to go to the village and bring the charm.
    <br>WATCH: Demon Comes PHYSICALLY
    <br>Out of Witchraft 'Charm'!!!
    <br>This is the place where the charm the man of God prophecied about last Sunday is.
    <br>This is where it is in my village.
    <br>This is where I kept the charm.
    <br>This is the Anointing Water that the man of God gave to me to spray
    <br>on the charm and bring it to Lagos.
    <br>WATCH: Demon Comes PHYSICALLY
    <br>Out of Witchraft 'Charm'!!!
    <br>I command you to be destroyed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>WATCH: Demon Comes PHYSICALLY
    <br>Out of Witchraft 'Charm'!!!
    <br>This is the black cloth that used to cover it.
    <br>I command you to be destroyed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>In line with the word of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>I command you to be destroyed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>WATCH: Demon Comes PHYSICALLY
    <br>Out of Witchraft 'Charm'!!!
    <br>This is the 'juju' (charm), the pot and everything.
    <br>This is the pot used for the sacrifice.
    <br>I never came here for the sacrifice.
    <br>I used to send people because the charm is very powerful.
    <br>This is the Anointing Water.
    <br>I command you to be destroyed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Look at the smoke!
    <br>Smoke is coming out!
    <br>Look at the smoke!
    <br>The power is going out.
    <br>The spirit is going out.
    <br>That smoke is a demon going away.
    <br>You see a pot but it is a demon.
    <br>Let's watch.
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Jesus! You see the smoke going out. Jesus!
    <br>I'm afraid because the spirit is going out.
    <br>Eh! Chineke (God)!
    <br>WATCH: Demon Comes PHYSICALLY
    <br>Out of Witchraft 'Charm'!!!
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>My hand is being shocked!
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, I command you to go out!
    <br>My hand is being shocked!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua sent me to destroy you with the Anointing Water
    <br>and I hereby destroy you, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>You must be destroyed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I command every power in you to be destroyed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>You must go to Lagos, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>If not for God, I would not have been able to carry it.
    <br>It is very powerful.
    <br>But in the name of Jesus, every power in this thing is destroyed.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Anthony Nnemeka arrives at The SCOAN with the charm.
    <br>He has come back for his final deliverance.
    <br>Thank God for the grace! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The purpose of watching this programme is for others to see and know that
    <br>there is refuge - Jesus is the refuge.
    <br>My name is Tony from Anambra State.
    <br>I was the one the man of God prophesied to last Sunday
    <br>that I have a charm in the village.
    <br>Yes, I'm the one.
    <br>It happened that when I had a problem, I went to a herbalist.
    <br>The herbalist said that he would prepare a charm for me.
    <br>After preparing the charm, he asked me to carry it to my house in the village
    <br>and keep it there and I did that.
    <br>I kept the charm in the village and came back to Lagos.
    <br>The charm always came and met me, the demon always came and met me in Lagos
    <br>and told me to come and sacrifice something like a dog or chicken and I would do that.
    <br>After doing that, I realised that the charm was destroying my family.
    <br>I decided to go for deliverance.
    <br>One day, I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw the way Prophet T.B. Joshua was delivering people
    <br>and I then decided to come to this place.
    <br>The night that I decided to come to this place, the demon came to meet me at midnight
    <br>and told me that as he was killing people, did I know that he can also kill me.
    <br>I asked him, "Why? What have I done?"
    <br>He did not answer me and left. That was before I came here last week Sunday.
    <br>Last week Sunday, the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>This is me and the charm is also here.
    <br>The man of God gave me Anointing Water to go to my village,
    <br>spray it on the charm and bring it to Lagos State. I then went.
    <br>In the process of spraying the Anointing Water, smoke began to come out of the charm.
    <br>I was very scared because the charm is very powerful.
    <br>After spraying the Anointing Water, the smoke stopped.
    <br>As I wanted to put the charm into the bag, the charm began to shock my hand.
    <br>I began to pray and sprayed the Anointing Water on my hand, then it stopped.
    <br>Then I put the charm into the bag and brought it to Lagos.
    <br>Man of God, the charm is outside.
    <br>The worst of sin can be forgiven
    <br>Are your sins so grave or small
    <br>This is where we put the things sacrificed to the charm.
    <br>The charm was for my protection.
    <br>Through this charm, I was initiated.
    <br>Get the Anointing Water.
    <br>Just take the carton there. Let him take one out of it.
    <br>Okay. We need to sanctify the two hands.
    <br>The man of God said that the Anointing Water should be given to the man
    <br>for total separation from this demonic charm,
    <br>as you can see on the screen of your television set.
    <br>A newcomer there, please come.
    <br>Follow her to that place and give her the Anointing Water.
    <br>Let her spray this Anointing Water on both hands.
    <br>Let us see what will happen to the man.
    <br>The Anointing Water we are going to collect today will be sprayed on both hands
    <br>which the man used to carry this demonic charm
    <br>so that we all can see the manifestation of the mighty power.
    <br>Just pick one out of it.
    <br>Watch the screen. The woman is picking the Anointing Water from the carton,
    <br>opening it, bringing it out and is about to unseal the Anointing Water bottle.
    <br>The Man of God has given her the instruction of what to do.
    <br>That she should ask the man to stretch out both hands
    <br>and she should spray the Anointing Water on both hands of the man.
    <br>On both hands, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Responding to the power in the Anointing Water,
    <br>see what is happening to the man.
    <br>He can no longer hold himself. See what is happening to him, spinning around.
    <br>We can see what is happening to him now.
    <br>Down he goes.
    <br>Ok. Go near to him and spray his hands on the floor.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Watch the screen and see what is happening to the man,
    <br>immediately the Anointing Water touched his hands.
    <br>You can see what is happening to him right now -
    <br>shaking uncontrollably.
    <br>And shout the name Jesus, Madam.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>That is deliverance. Watch your screen.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give thanks to God for what the Lord has done in our lives today
    <br>and for what you have seen.
