  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Continue to worship the Lord in the beauty of His holiness
    <br>as we reflect on God's track record in our lives.
    <br>He is the beat in this once still heart.
    <br>He is the breath in this once lifeless being.
    <br>He is the life in these once dry bones.
    <br>He is our testimony.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "He is my testimony".
    <br>Once we forget where we are coming from, we are lost
    <br>because the beginning of success is deeper than the success itself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God is my testimony".
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of the Lord.
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Angela and I'm from America.
    <br>I pray today that our hearts would be open to God's Word,
    <br>God's faith and God's Spirit, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In every generation from the time of Christ until now,
    <br>a new wave of persecution has swept across the shores of Christianity.
    <br>Take your mind back to the apostles of old - Matthew, Peter, Stephen, John and Paul -
    <br>they were beheaded, crucified upside down, dropped in boiling oil,
    <br>stoned to death and even skinned alive.
    <br>They were disciples of Christ, men of credibility
    <br>who paid the supreme price to bring the Gospel to us.
    <br>Today the wave of persecution still continues.
    <br>But where it's coming from may not be where you think.
    <br>This will lead us to the title of today's message:
    <br>THE NEW WAVE OF PERSECUTION
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Let me speak from experience.
    <br>I first came to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations with a body riddled with disability
    <br>and an expiry date over my head.
    <br>This is my X-ray.
    <br>These are my bones. This is my body.
    <br>This is what the devil tried to use to destroy me.
    <br>You can see the curve and the twisting.
    <br>At the age of 14 my bones began twisting and they wouldn't stop.
    <br>At this point, I was under the care of the government;
    <br>they were taking care of my treatment and my therapy,
    <br>along with others like me who were wheelchair-bound and bedridden.
    <br>Those who are in US will understand what I'm talking about.
    <br>After six years of therapy and treatment the doctors called me
    <br>and said there was nothing more they could do for me.
    <br>My bones continued to twist;
    <br>there was nothing they could do to stop them from continuing to twist
    <br>and they couldn't reverse the damage and they couldn't even reduce my excruciating pain.
    <br>They then told me that my bones had begun crushing my organs
    <br>and I would soon be on a wheelchair.
    <br>And after my organs started failing one after the other, I would be bedridden
    <br>before I came to an untimely death.
    <br>I remember counting the remaining years they gave me on my two hands.
    <br>But one day, a visitor brought a video from this church - The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations -
    <br>to my local church in California and at that moment, death died and life began for me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When I started by saying, "He is my testimony",l I want you to understand what I mean:
    <br>Jesus is my testimony.
    <br>The scars are still there.
    <br>I don't know if the camera man can come.
    <br>The trace is still on my body.
    <br>I want you to see God's track record in my life.
    <br>If you turn, you can see the scar;
    <br>you can see what has happened.
    <br>Some of you may have looked at me in the past and said, "Something's just not right."
    <br>But something's just perfect.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have outlived my expiry date by 11 years and counting,
    <br>all by the grace of the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I will never forget that Wednesday service in California.
    <br>As I watched the videos, I saw the name of Jesus restore life to those with deadly diseases -
    <br>HIV, AIDS, cancer - to those crippled, to those blind and deaf.
    <br>I saw that the liberation of man is not something just hoped for or a mere wish after all.
    <br>Jesus Christ delivered and still delivers man physically from disease, hunger and want.
    <br>Jesus delivers man mentally from being ruled by the senses and brings His Spirit.
    <br>The child of God does not have to be lorded over by satan,
    <br>for Jesus delivers man spiritually from satan's bond.
    <br>As I watched testimony after testimony unfold before my eyes,
    <br>I then traced their steps to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, what the devil started in my life came to a full stop -
    <br>I was healed, I was whole, I was free!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can imagine with such joy, I ran to share my testimony with everyone I could find.
    <br>Surprisingly, I kept hearing two questions:
    <br>From America, "Why did you go to Nigeria for prayer?"
    <br>And from Nigeria, "Why did you go to see T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>Why Nigeria?
    <br>Why Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Because America has everything for me - everything but one thing.
    <br>And that one thing I found in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua:
    <br>I found God real, alive and at work.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why Nigeria?
    <br>Why Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Because God confirms the words of His servants by performing them, by accompanying them
    <br>and by establishing them.
    <br>When God's Word on our lips is the same as it was in the Master's lips,
    <br>the very life of God in those words is capable of changing situations.
    <br>I was changed.
    <br>But many people, church people, kept asking me, "Why?"
    <br>Why should the lost be found?
    <br>Why should the sick be healed?
    <br>Why should the dead be recovered from the grave?
    <br>Because it didn't happen in your church, because it didn't happen in your ministry
    <br>and because it didn't happen in your country does not mean it should not happen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the new wave of persecution.
    <br>Body of Christ - we persecute ourselves; why will others not behead us?
    <br>We call ourselves names; why will others not call us devils?
    <br>We disbelieve ourselves; why will others not pursue us to death?
    <br>It is written in Matthew 1:23 that Mary would give birth to a child
    <br>and His name would be Emmanuel, meaning, God with us.
    <br>We were all one in the beginning -
    <br>in the beginning when God said, "Be fruitful and multiply."
    <br>But we reversed that equation.
    <br>Where God said, "Multiply", we said, "Divide" -
    <br>divide your church according to colour, divide according to denomination,
    <br>divide according to mentor or spiritual father, divide according to political belief.
    <br>But it is written again in Matthew 18:20 that
    <br>"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst."
    <br>It wasn't just one disciple Jesus revealed Himself to on the Mount of Transfiguration.
    <br>It wasn't just one disciple Jesus said would be
    <br>"My witness in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and the ends of the earth."
    <br>It wasn't just one disciple in the hall when the storm came.
    <br>It was a coming together, a forming of relationship when Pentecost fell.
    <br>But now, I cannot relate with you.
    <br>You too, find your way.
    <br>And you cannot relate with me.
    <br>Find your way.
    <br>What is the position of Jesus then?
    <br>Where is Jesus in our midst?
    <br>I'm sorry, but where is our midst?
    <br>Look at this.
    <br>If pastors and priests cannot walk together as one, how will their members walk together?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How many of us are members of a church, a congregation or a fellowship?
    <br>Let me see your hand.
    <br>How many of us are members of churches?
    <br>Then this question is about you.
    <br>If pastors and prophets cannot walk together as one, how will their members walk together?
    <br>If bishops and cardinals cannot walk together as one, how will their members walk together?
    <br>And if we don't walk together, how will we accomplish the mission of the Gospel?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>If we do not walk together, how will we accomplish the mission of the Gospel?
    <br>The mission of the Gospel is not just in word alone - human eloquence, excellence in speaking -
    <br>but in the mighty power, in the mighty energy of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>converting and quickening, enlightening and sanctifying all believers.
    <br>The purpose of the Gospel is to enable believers to take their place in the believer's authority,
    <br>to preach the Gospel, heal the sick and deliver and save the lost.
    <br>But generations continue to wander, still lost and unsure of where to turn
    <br>because of what we are doing and saying against one another.
    <br>But come to think of it, we do not seem to mind the faith of the president or the wealthy
    <br>before we wine and dine with them,
    <br>while we keep persecuting ourselves and causing division in the Body of Christ.
    <br>Let me say that again.
    <br>We do not mind the faith of the president or the wealthy
    <br>and are happy to wine and dine with them,
    <br>while we keep persecuting ourselves and causing division in our own body.
    <br>This is the new wave of persecution.
    <br>I need to tell you what else I found in my local church that day.
    <br>On a table in the lobby, before we ever reached the videos, was a popular American magazine.
    <br>It had a story on the Prophet, so I read it.
    <br>I remember it was the very first time I heard the name, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>And at the end, a prominent figure in American Christianity advised the readers,
    <br>"Be careful! Don't go there! It's a sin to attend a different fellowship.
    <br>Watch out for that pastor!
    <br>If care is not taken, even the elect will be deceived.
    <br>We must rise up against him!"
    <br>And many in the church developed fear and hatred for a person they had never met
    <br>and a church they had never attended
    <br>because of what they read on the pages of a magazine.
    <br>Many allowed others to inspire them with words contrary to God's Word
    <br>and to incite them against their fellow brother.
    <br>And the more they rebuked, bound and loosed, the more divided they became
    <br>and the further away they got from Jesus' prayer in John 17.
    <br>Please turn in your Bibles to the Book of John 17 and read the entire Scripture,
    <br>the entire prayer.
    <br>But this morning we are going to read out of it.
    <br>John 17; we will take our reading from verse 1.
    <br>"After Jesus said this, he looked toward Heaven and prayed: 'Father, the hour has come.
    <br>Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
    <br>For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life
    <br>to all those you have given him.
    <br>Now this is eternal life:
    <br>that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.' "
    <br>Verse 6:
    <br>"I have revealed you to those who you gave me out of the world.
    <br>They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word."
    <br>Verse 20:
    <br>"My prayer is not for them alone.
    <br>I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message."
    <br>Say, "This is me".
    <br>"My prayer is not for them alone.
    <br>I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
    <br>that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.
    <br>May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
    <br>I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one -
    <br>I in them and you in me - so that they may be brought to complete unity."
    <br>The Gospel of Christ unites us as one but our own gospel today divides us into pieces
    <br>because the names of our churches are different.
    <br>Take note, the names are only symbolic.
    <br>The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations, United Methodist are merely symbolic;
    <br>Jesus is the Head of the Church, the Hope of Glory.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Pentecostal Church, the Presbyterian Church are merely symbolic;
    <br>Jesus is the Head of the Church, the Hope of Glory.
    <br>What the Bible stands for is unity but the one we preach today calls for division.
    <br>If there is disunity among the followers, tell me what will happen among others?
    <br>We will expect worse and we are seeing worse
    <br>as the number of those killed through persecution rises moment by moment.
    <br>And yet some in the church continue shouting, "But I am for Paul!"
    <br>And others keep yelling, "But I am for Peter!"
    <br>Ask God who Paul is and who Peter is.
    <br>For though the body of man is made up of different parts,
    <br>its workings are informed by the Spirit of one purpose.
    <br>And so there is no division in the body
    <br>but each of its members have the same concern for one another.
    <br>What is the greatest member of the human body?
    <br>The head? The mouth?
    <br>Now tell me the least member of the human body.
    <br>The chin? The toe?
    <br>Yes,  this is my little toe - you can't see it; I covered it.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because it is so insignificant, so small, so weak, so powerless and weightless.
    <br>I have often asked myself, "Why do I need little toes?"
    <br>You ever asked yourself that question, "Why do I need that little toe?"
    <br>But just let the body know you have an issue with your toe.
    <br>Let the body know there is a problem.
    <br>"Hey, my toe! I hit my toe! I think it's bleeding! Can you help me?
    <br>Please, take me to the hospital - my toe is bleeding."
    <br>- "Are you OK? What happened?"
    <br>- "I had a problem with my toe."
    <br>Don't worry - it was a crisis.
    <br>This is the smallest member of my body; it is the weakest member of my body
    <br>but every member was engaged for its rescue.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the least member of my body but every member was concerned for its recovery.
    <br>Such is to be the Body of Christ.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Such is to be the Body of Christ.
    <br>This actually reminds me of the incident that happened here in The SCOAN.
    <br>Over 100 people were killed, from different nations.
    <br>I followed them to the court but surprisingly, it was other religions -
    <br>for example, Muslims and others - who were coming to the court in support.
    <br>It was kings and queens who were coming to court in support;
    <br>not a single Christian body turned up.
    <br>I personally received the phone calls in the office
    <br>from the Sultan of Sokoto, the head of the Muslim Community,
    <br>and other Emirs and Islamic leaders registering their concerns and their support.
    <br>But not a call came from Christian leaders here.
    <br>How? Why?
    <br>We persecute ourselves.
    <br>Why will others not persecute us?
    <br>Why will others not behead us?
    <br>Why will others not pursue us?
    <br>But when the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia,
    <br>we saw solidarity from different Christian bodies in Nigeria here.
    <br>Where is our conscience?
    <br>Remember Romans 9:1: Our conscience is the communication point or contact point
    <br>for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Oh, my toe!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Oh, my toe!"
    <br>Let someone say, "Oh, my toe!"
    <br>Such is to be the Body of Christ.
    <br>But there has been a great mix-up in the church that has affected our witness, our preaching,
    <br>our prayers and our worship.
    <br>This pastor can't visit that pastor because of what they preach from their pulpit.
    <br>A member of this church can't be a member of that church because of the doctrine they follow;
    <br>I mean, what their pastors are telling them.
    <br>The Gospel of Jesus Christ cuts across doctrine, across denomination and across ideology.
    <br>This is the Gospel we have been entrusted with -
    <br>from those who gave their very lives that we might have it.
    <br>But we continue to take their lives again and again every time we speak against our sister,
    <br>condemn another ministry and fight our fellow man.
    <br>There is one thing we must know:
    <br>Those who fight against God and His prophets have deceived themselves
    <br>and are justly given up to delusions.
    <br>The enemies of God and His Church, when they fancy themselves ready to triumph,
    <br>will find themselves conquered and triumphed over.
    <br>Let us be very careful.
    <br>It is possible to grow up in a church, learn all the rights and not know God at all.
    <br>You can read your New Testament and never find Christ.
    <br>You can head a religious body, be a senior pastor and not know God at all
    <br>because Christianity stands and falls on Jesus Christ, on the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>According to 1 Corinthians 12:3, "No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord' without the help of the Holy Spirit."
    <br>This means you only know Jesus as far as the Holy Spirit is pleased to reveal Him to you.
    <br>But when what you are doing, what you are saying is not pleasing Him,
    <br>how then will the Spirit of God reveal Christ to you?
    <br>The Word of God is a tool, the instrument in the hands of the Holy Spirit, to save you, change you,
    <br>bless you, make you one with a difference and cause you to make a difference.
    <br>But how many, because the Word does not prevail, do not make a difference?
    <br>For many centuries, things have been going on the same way
    <br>because of the chief priests and scribes you follow.
    <br>How sad it is to live in an age of Sabbaths and sacraments, prayers and sermons in vain!
    <br>And the wave of persecution continues to sweep our body away.
    <br>THE NEW WAVE OF PERSECUTION
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua made a difference in my life.
    <br>I was never asked what church I attended before he prayed for me.
    <br>I was never asked what denomination I belonged to before he gave his time,
    <br>his years to mentor me.
    <br>But you said he is the one I should watch out for?
    <br>In Acts 9, when Ananias was called by the Lord to look for Saul,
    <br>he didn't first ask Saul for a certificate of his conversion before he laid hands on him;
    <br>he simply acted in obedience to God.
    <br>In Acts 10, when Peter was called to Cornelius' house,
    <br>he didn't first ask for a letter of approval from the leaders to visit a Gentile;
    <br>he simply went in obedience to God.
    <br>As Peter spoke God's Word, the Holy Spirit fell on the hearers.
    <br>God bore witness to Peter's words, God owned Peter's words
    <br>and Peter succeeded in carrying them along to Christ by the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The same Peter was later crucified for his obedience to the Gospel.
    <br>Jesus had earlier eulogised Peter while he was still alive.
    <br>He said, "You are Peter and on this rock, I will build my Church."
    <br>Jesus was telling Peter that the persecutions he was to suffer would be a tonic to the anointing.
    <br>Here we are today: the Church, after many centuries - alive and still growing.
    <br>Persecution is a tonic to the anointing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Persecution is a tonic to the anointing.]
    <br>Hatred is a tonic to the anointing.
    <br>Chastisement is a tonic to the anointing.
    <br>People of God,
    <br>they never asked for approval from their leaders before they acted in obedience to God. Why?
    <br>Because knowledge is not the key; obedience is.
    <br>Position is not the key.
    <br>Power is not the key.
    <br>Popularity is not the key.
    <br>Time in the pulpit is not even the key; obedience is.
    <br>I am whole today because of obedience to God's Word.
    <br>People of God, Body of Christ,
    <br>what we are seeing happening around the world -
    <br>Christian persecution, beheading of Christians, chastisement - these are calls for unity.
    <br>"I'm a Baptist, I'm a Methodist, I'm a Pentecostal,
    <br>I'm Synagogue, I'm redeemed..."  are mere names.
    <br>Let us all come together.
    <br>We are heirs of the Father
    <br>We are joint heirs with the Son
    <br>We are children of the Kingdom
    <br>We are family
    <br>We are one
    <br>We are heirs of the Father
    <br>We are joint heirs with the Son
    <br>We are children of the Kingdom
    <br>We are family
    <br>We are one
    <br>We are one, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Body of Christ, persecution is a tonic to the anointing.
    <br>Ask Gamaliel in Acts 5 and he will tell you what he said in the midst of great persecution
    <br>of the apostles of old.
    <br>He said, "Leave these men alone! Let them go! If their activity is of human origin, it will fail.
    <br>But if it is from God, you cannot stop these men. You will find yourself only fighting against God."
    <br>We have seen that evidence.
    <br>You are on the seats today.
    <br>Think of how much you persecuted in the past what we are enjoying today.
    <br>Think of how much you hated in the past what we are seeing.
    <br>"Turn off that channel. I will not see that man. Over my dead body..."
    <br>What you persecuted, your sons and daughters are beneficiaries of.
    <br>I am one of the beneficiaries of what you hated,
    <br>what you persecuted, what you falsely imprisoned.
    <br>I am whole today because I listened to my conscience.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Listen to your conscience".
    <br>Brothers and sisters, what we see happening around the world is a call for unity.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, the Hope of Glory.
    <br>Right now, examine your life in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Look at your words.
    <br>Look at your hands.
    <br>If you find yourself still grasping the weapons of persecution,
    <br>this is your opportunity to lay them down.
    <br>Paul, after persecuting the Church, joined himself to them.
    <br>This unprecedented revolutionary story of reconciliation is still being written.
    <br>Don't rejoice that you bear a Christian title or position;
    <br>rejoice that your name is written into this story where hostilities are destroyed,
    <br>where enemies become friends,
    <br>where a brood of vipers becomes a seed of saints
    <br>and where the lion dwells with the lamb.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>The Word and Spirit are inseparable.
    <br>Such is to be the Body of Christ - one and inseparable.
    <br>I pray that before the coming of Christ,
    <br>true believers would see reason to be unified in Jesus' name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Christ in You is the Hope of Glory
    <br>You are my temple
    <br>And I will dwell in you
    <br>Christ in You is the Hope of Glory
    <br>I will walk in you
    <br>I will be your God
    <br>And you shall be My people
    <br>Christ in You is the Hope of Glory
    <br>You are my temple
    <br>And I will dwell in you
    <br>Christ in You is the Hope of Glory
    <br>I will walk in you
    <br>I will be your God
    <br>And you shall be My people
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I mean those under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>I believe you are healed by this word!
    <br>I believe you are saved by this word!
    <br>I believe you are delivered by this word!
    <br>I believe you are set free by this word, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Rejoice!
