  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Viewers, we salute you and we salute your faith.
    <br>No one is greater than Him - Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's talk generally about our lives.
    <br>It is all about faith.
    <br>We are the household of faith.
    <br>CHRISTIANITY LIES IN THE HEART
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of Mark 9.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>"He said to them, 'Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death
    <br>before they see that the Kingdom of God has come with power'."
    <br>Read with me - that is just the first text.
    <br>I take it again; Mark 9:1.
    <br>"He said to them, 'Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death
    <br>before they see that the Kingdom of God has come with power'."
    <br>When you talk of the Kingdom of God, you talk of power.
    <br>Glory - power.
    <br>Let's go to verse 14.
    <br>"When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them
    <br>and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
    <br>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and run to greet Him."
    <br>"Good Morning, Sir".
    <br>Are you reading along with me?
    <br>Let's take it again - verse 14:
    <br>"When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them
    <br>and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
    <br>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and run to greet Him."
    <br>They abandoned the teachers of the law.
    <br>Now, verse 16:
    <br>" 'What are you arguing with them about?' he asked.
    <br>A man in the crowd answered, 'Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed
    <br>by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
    <br>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground.
    <br>He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid.
    <br>I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not'.
    <br>'You unbelieving generation', Jesus answered, 'How long shall I stay with you?
    <br>How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me'."
    <br>The issue is not even disciples now.
    <br>They were reporting disciples to Jesus but Jesus took the issue to all of you -
    <br>"You unbelieving generation. How long shall I stay with you?
    <br>How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to Me."
    <br>That is, "I have been in your midst for long and you have been seeing this happening".
    <br>...with the teaching, message, going from churches - yet...
    <br>Verse 23.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>" 'If you can?' said Jesus. 'Everything is possible for one who believes.' "
    <br>We are talking about our faith.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are the household of faith and your faith has no alternative.
    <br>Whether there is food on the table or not, or whether there is money in your pocket or not,
    <br>Jesus is our Lord.
    <br>If I'm talking to you...
    <br>I'm talking to you - thank you.
    <br>This is an encouragement to the timid soul; I mean, faithless generation, like Jesus has said.
    <br>He called them faithless generation, unbelieving generation, which I regard as a timid soul.
    <br>We are in a generation where there are many impatient people;
    <br>we have many people that have come here today and have gone,
    <br>"When will the pastor come out? What is happening?"
    <br>This is an encouragement.
    <br>So, what is the message saying here?
    <br>He said, "Bring the boy to Me. You unbelieving generation.
    <br>How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?
    <br>You see Me within, outside - yet..."
    <br>You are not called upon to look within to see how much faith you have
    <br>but you are called to look unto God, the Author.
    <br>Faith is natural.
    <br>It was not that the disciples did not have power - you have power, I have power -
    <br>but they lacked necessary faith to release the power.
    <br>If you don't have power, you cannot wake up...
    <br>Your enemies don't want you to wake up.
    <br>You are saying to Jesus, "Protect me" and you are protected.
    <br>You may not see that as a miracle.
    <br>You like money, you need money - you just want that miracle of money;
    <br>if the prayer for money is not answered - no miracle.
    <br>I think I'm right.
    <br>Your miracle that you wake up, walk freely, laugh freely, eat freely, sleep freely -
    <br>everything, you sit freely...
    <br>There are many people who are looking forward to that miracle -
    <br>they want to walk, talk, look freely, they want to sit down in our midst.
    <br>Here you are talking freely...
    <br>You have been dancing...
    <br>Oh, there was one dance I want to dance.
    <br>I saw that dance; I said I must repeat it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The thing escaped my mind.
    <br>In fact, I wrote the name... the name is there.
    <br>The name of that dance.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I got it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I got it.
    <br>The thing just escaped my mind; it was the message that reminded me
    <br>not to forget the dance I wanted to dance.
    <br>I saw when you were doing like this.
    <br>You are walking, talking freely.
    <br>Look, here you are.
    <br>You even sweat freely.
    <br>There are many people praying to sweat - there is nothing.
    <br>You laugh, dance freely - there are many people in bondage,
    <br>looking forward to have the opportunity you have today,
    <br>but here you are.
    <br>The disciples - not that they did not have power
    <br>but they lacked necessary faith to release the power.
    <br>What we need to do is to use our faith to put a demand upon anointing.
    <br>We use our faith to put a demand on the anointing.
    <br>They had power but lacked necessary faith.
    <br>You have power but you lack necessary...
    <br>Somebody says, "I don't have power of God" - no.
    <br>Some people will be praying, "God, give me power..." - that is a wrong prayer.
    <br>How can you ask God to give you power?
    <br>You have!
    <br>But to release this power...
    <br>It is the measure of faith you have,
    <br>this is the measure of the power and grace of God you enjoy.
    <br>Faith is a Heavenly currency.
    <br>The disciples had power but they lacked the necessary faith
    <br>to release the power they needed to deliver the boy.
    <br>They had been delivering people before that time,
    <br>they had been casting out demons, but this one became a stiff opposition.
    <br>They needed to get to certain level, degree to do that job.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Faith is natural.
    <br>We need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
    <br>You don't need the greater faith but you need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
    <br>If you pay attention to God's Word, you will find that faith comes spontaneously,
    <br>that is, naturally.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>The more you look at God, look to God and meditate on God's Word,
    <br>the more you will find that faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>Look at God, look to God, meditate on His Word day and night.
    <br>When you realise that God is reliable, your faith will simultaneously grow,
    <br>that is, side by side.
    <br>"God is great" - that will take you to another level.
    <br>These testimonies you heard now; if you sincerely confess with your heart...
    <br>When you see something happening, you say, "Hallelujah!" -
    <br>if you do it sincerely with all your heart, that will take you to another level of faith.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about.
    <br>Any moment from now, what you will be seeing happening -
    <br>when it happens, you say, "God is great" - it will take you to another level of faith.
    <br>Let me take you back again.
    <br>When you realise that God is reliable, your faith will simultaneously grow,
    <br>that is, side by side.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Some of us when we confess, "Jesus is great", we are not doing that with all our hearts.
    <br>We hear people shouting - we shout.
    <br>I'm not talking of that.
    <br>We see people crying, "Hallelujah!", you do the same - no!
    <br>When you are convinced with all your heart, you shout, "Jesus is Lord!" -
    <br>it takes you to another level.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is natural.
    <br>Faith is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest,
    <br>trustworthy, reliable and stable.
    <br>Jesus is honest, faithful, reliable and trustworthy.
    <br>You cannot say, "I have faith in you" - it is a misused language; to have faith in a human being.
    <br>Who is honest, trustworthy, stable, reliable?
    <br>Faith is perfected by our acting on God's Word.
    <br>By looking into the Word and acting it, you bring Jesus on the scene instantly.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By what?
    <br>By looking into the Word of God, with attention, with all your heart,
    <br>and acting it, you bring Jesus on the scene.
    <br>"Jesus!" - you see Jesus.
    <br>Anytime you say, "Jesus!" - Jesus is there.
    <br>"Be healed!" - before you say it, you see Jesus on the scene.
    <br>"Be delivered!" - you see Jesus on the scene.
    <br>Faith is perfected by our acting on the Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not an issue of "I'm looking for faith".
    <br>Many of us read the Bible three times in a year or once in a month, yet - no faith.
    <br>Listen!
    <br>Faith is natural.
    <br>The more you look at God, look to God, meditate on the Word,
    <br>the more you will find that faith comes spontaneously, naturally.
    <br>I will give you another...
    <br>An expression and belief that Jesus is reliable gives you a slot of faith.
    <br>With all your heart...
    <br>Maybe, you are coming to the church for the first time today,
    <br>you say, "Jesus is great. I don't know what happened."
    <br>Just believe with your heart that Jesus is great.
    <br>It gives you a slot of faith.
    <br>Your faith grows simultaneously.
    <br>You just need to release yourself.
    <br>Whatever you do in His presence, do it with all your heart.
    <br>What does not come from your heart is a sin.
    <br>What does not come from faith is a sin because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>Don't allow your emotions, your feelings to control you.
    <br>You just feel, "There is a sound in my ear; something is about to happen" -
    <br>that is not Christ, that is not of God.
    <br>Or you are just going and see spider webs; many of you have this kind of sign.
    <br>You move and you suddenly find a spider web covering your face,
    <br>you say, "I have to go back home. Danger."
    <br>Because it has happened to you many times and something happened,
    <br>so you now believe that something will continue to happen because of that spider web.
    <br>These are feelings.
    <br>What people say about you, what people believe about you should not control your faith.
    <br>You know yourself more than anyone.
    <br>People say, "You have been going to church and you are still sick".
    <br>They believe that you are not serving the Living God - that is their belief.
    <br>That should not be the outcome of your faith.
    <br>God can use anything to preserve us - to keep you somewhere for a while.
    <br>The disciples of Jesus were not happy that they were humiliated
    <br>because they were healing, delivering people before they met that stiff opposition.
    <br>They were setting people free, healing, delivering people but now they were facing a stiff opposition,
    <br>they could not deliver.
    <br>When they were arguing among themselves,
    <br>the disciples were saying, "Be delivered!"; the noise was so much.
    <br>The Pharisees and Sadducees were around looking at them.
    <br>They saw Jesus coming from afar.
    <br>They looked at Jesus, they abandoned the disciples and the demon-possessed boy.
    <br>They run to Jesus.
    <br>The father of the demon-possessed boy run there, "Good Afternoon, Sir.
    <br>I brought my son to Your disciples and they could not deliver him".
    <br>He said, "I believe - that is why I am here. Help my unbelief".
    <br>He confessed two things.
    <br>He said, "I believe - that is why I am here".
    <br>"In my own way I believe" - that is the meaning, in a religious way.
    <br>"But if my religious belief is not going to meet Your belief, please, help my unbelief."
    <br>Because the man was a religious man.
    <br>You should know that there is a difference between religious people and Christianity.
    <br>But in the world today, there is the same definition, meaning to them.
    <br>But there is a difference.
    <br>Christianity believes that Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship
    <br>between God and man.
    <br>That is the definition of Christianity.
    <br>Our belief as Christians is that Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship
    <br>between God and man - that is Christian.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To restore this relationship, "tit for tat" is not accepted.
    <br>When you slap me...
    <br>As a Christian, you are not allowed to hold an offence, whether you are right or wrong -
    <br>that is Christianity.
    <br>Whether you are wrong or right, you are not allowed,
    <br>you are not permitted to hold an offence.
    <br>That is Christianity.
    <br>Are you a Christian?
    <br>If you are not a Christian, you are religious people.
    <br>People don't know the difference between Christianity and religious people.
    <br>The father of the demon-possessed boy was a religious man.
    <br>That is why he ran to Jesus.
    <br>"I believe - that is why I am here".
    <br>It means,
    <br>"I believe in my own, religious way - 'tit for tat' ".
    <br>You hate me, I hate you.
    <br>You forgive me, I forgive you.
    <br>That is religious standard.
    <br>You help me, I help you - love for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>But our love is unconditional.
    <br>These are the challenges we are facing today.
    <br>CHRISTIANITY LIES IN THE HEART
    <br>What does not come from your heart is a sin.
    <br>Can you imagine how many sins you commit everyday?
    <br>When you greet your brother and it is not from your heart -
    <br>you just have to greet because he is your senior.
    <br>And immediately when you finish greeting him, and he turns his back to you...
    <br>If I'm right...
    <br>Maybe you don't understand what I'm saying.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Christianity lies in the heart.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Christianity lies in the heart.]
    <br>That means that what is not from your heart is a sin.
    <br>Can you imagine how many sins you committed today?
    <br>You greet somebody because he is your superior or your boss.
    <br>You greet him because you need help.
    <br>Ninety percent of what you do every day is not from your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You help people but the help is not from your heart - for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>Can you imagine how many friends you have today that are not from your heart?
    <br>It is like you are under a kind of force you cannot resist.
    <br>Even when you have to greet your boss in your working place, "Good Afternoon, sir",
    <br>it is not from your heart.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>This is to tell you that many good things people do, don't have a record with God.
    <br>Charity, help, favour, assistance to people, money you give...
    <br>People say, "This man is kind", but at the end of the day you find him in hell fire.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Because those things are not from the heart.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Now, sit down and tell me how many things you do from your heart.
    <br>Even prayer; when I say "Rise up and pray" -
    <br>because I said it, you would rise, not that you believe.
    <br>When we start praying, you see...
    <br>Not that you believe.
    <br>When I say, "In Jesus' name!", you say, "Amen!" - not from your heart.
    <br>You see it as a tradition; you just have to say, "Amen!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is a problem.
    <br>You will see on the outside many very kind, nice people - you will still find them in hell fire.
    <br>"Ah, very nice, good man - what a wonderful man. Oh my God. He can give his life.
    <br>Oh, he is wonderful. What a generous, kind woman" - those things are not from the heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why our life is like this.
    <br>See your life, see all what you are doing.
    <br>How many of us actually pray for sickness?
    <br>Why sickness?
    <br>How many of us pray for hardship?
    <br>Why are you facing hardship today?
    <br>Because the prayer you offer is not from your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You pray for blessing, "Lord, bless me..." - at the end you face poverty.
    <br>It means what you are praying for is not from your heart.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart and what does not come from faith is a sin.
    <br>CHRISTIANITY LIES IN THE HEART
    <br>If you say you are a Christian, whatever you are doing that is not from your heart,
    <br>God knows nothing about it, it's not from God.
    <br>Whatever you do that is not from your heart, God is not the rewarder.
    <br>God is our Rewarder.
    <br>If you don't want to greet, don't greet.
    <br>But greeting that is not from your heart...
    <br>People will smile to you, "How are you?".
    <br>As a result of our life, what you are doing, people see you doing - that is not from your heart.
    <br>No one here actually prays for poverty.
    <br>Why poverty?
    <br>God is not deaf and dumb, He is not a man that lies; when you call Him, He hears you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>From today, I order that pretentious life to go.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to rebuke that pretentious life.
    <br>You keep pretending; all what you are doing is not from your heart.
    <br>Begin to rebuke them.
    <br>I order that pretentious life, in the name of Jesus, to go, to leave you!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>It is almost the way of life, business - you have to pretend.
    <br>You have to pretend to love, whereas you don't love the person.
    <br>You have to pretend to greet, whereas it is not what you intend to do in your heart.
    <br>You have to pretend to care, whereas you don't mean to care.
    <br>Life has been like that - almost the way of life.
    <br>For how long shall we continue this?
    <br>And God is our Rewarder.
    <br>How do we receive a reward?
    <br>This is not actually the reward of life you are living.
    <br>What you say on the outside is quite different from the life you find yourself in.
    <br>The prayer you offer; you fast and pray...
    <br>You keep praying for blessing, poverty keeps coming.
    <br>You keep praying for breakthrough, setback keeps coming.
    <br>You keep praying for healing, sickness keeps coming.
    <br>It means that these prayers you offer are not from your heart
    <br>and whatever that is not from your heart is a sin.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If your relationship with people has been from your heart,
    <br>disappointment cannot separate you.
    <br>Husband and wife - if you sincerely love your husband and your husband loves you
    <br>and that love is from the heart, hatred will bring more understanding to the marriage.
    <br>Disappointment will bring more understanding to the marriage;
    <br>it will promote the marriage, not separate the marriage.
    <br>Where is it in the Bible that when you marry, your marriage is out of trouble, out of touch?
    <br>Where is it?
    <br>Why does trouble separate the marriage?
    <br>Why does crisis separate the marriage, the relationship?
    <br>Because we are not sincere; the marriage is not from the heart.
    <br>We marry because of outward appearance, because of what we see -
    <br>money, property, beauty, outward looks.
    <br>These are the reasons we get married
    <br>and these kinds of reasons cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They cannot stand the test of time because outward reasons will soon fade away.
    <br>The beauty, handsomeness, property, money will soon fade away.
    <br>Look at what is happening now: Many businesses and marriages have collapsed
    <br>because the reason for marriage was money, property.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You want to be like Jesus; you want to be like Him.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>I order everything that has to do with satan, that stands against the will of God in your life,
    <br>I order it out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be ordered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You confess Jesus but to act Jesus - that is where your problem is.
    <br>You say, "Jesus is Lord" but to say this with all your heart - that is where your problem is.
    <br>Anybody can say, "Jesus is Lord" but not everyone can say, "Jesus is Lord" with all his heart.
    <br>When we confess Jesus, we must confess Him with our heart.
    <br>How many of you confess "Jesus is my Lord" with all your heart?
    <br>Anybody can confess this.
    <br>I come against everything that is not of God!
    <br>Anything that is not of God in your life -
    <br>your confession that is not from your heart, I come against it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why satan keeps dislodging us, replacing us because we are not where God wants us to be.
    <br>Where God wants us to be is where our heart is.
    <br>He plants us where our heart is.
    <br>Right now, I order your heart to listen.
    <br>Listen to the voice of God.
    <br>You heart, listen to the voice of God!
    <br>My lifetime
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>If I give God my lifetime
    <br>He will take care of me
    <br>He will never ever let me down
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>Can you see? You have confessed the right thing.
    <br>You say if you give your lifetime to God, He will not let you down.
    <br>Already you have let God down.
    <br>You disappoint God.
    <br>You have said it, "If I give my lifetime to You God, I know You will not let me down".
    <br>Because you have not been doing what you were doing with your heart,
    <br>definitely, what are you expecting from God?
    <br>Sing it again.
    <br>My lifetime
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>If I give God my lifetime
    <br>He will take care of me
    <br>He will never ever let me down
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>There is no other way you can give your lifetime to God without your heart,
    <br>where God is interested, the greatest faculty.
    <br>It's the communicator between the visible and invisible,
    <br>that is, material world and immaterial world - your heart -
