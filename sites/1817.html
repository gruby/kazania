    <br>Good Morning & Win Today
    <br>Yes, viewers, welcome back to the program.
    <br>So just as we have read earlier to you
    <br>testimonies of people whose lives have been touched and changed,
    <br>we have a lot of people who are also sending emails, they want to ask questions.
    <br>They have so many questions bothering them on several issues concerning
    <br>tithing, giving, offering - I mean the works of charity that they see Emmanuel TV 
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua doing in several places and several countries.
    <br>And I am going to be reading one of such emails to us.
    <br>This person is writing from the United States of America.
    <br>He says: My name is Peter Junior. T.B. Joshua,
    <br>after watching Emmanuel TV, you have told us to give works of charity,
    <br>but I realize you do not talk about tithes and offerings.
    <br>What is your position about this? Because I want to give an offering to your ministry.
    <br>How then do you get money to do what you are doing when you do not ask for offering?
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>That is a very critical issue in the body of Christ.
    <br>Brother Chris, would you like to answer?
    <br>This is a controversial topic that you want me to talk about.
    <br>No problem, viewers. I know that money is our friends - for many of us.
    <br>Let us go to the Word of God first and foremost because the answers are always in the Word of God.
    <br>As Christians, the Word of God should become the database for our personal opinion.
    <br>First and foremost, it is scriptural to give an offering (Malachi 3:10).
    <br>In fact, God says that when you do so, He will pour out blessings from Heaven
    <br>such that you will not be able to contain those blessings. So it scriptural, yes. But
    <br>in line with the question you are asking, I want you to understand one thing very clearly.
    <br>That we do not ask for offerings does not mean people are not giving.
    <br>People whom God prompts their conscience to give, they are giving.
    <br>God prompts their conscience. If you have your Bible with you, wherever you are watching, 
    <br>turn with me to the Book of Exodus 25:2 (NIV). The Scripture reads thus:
    <br>"You are to receive the offerings for me from everyone whose hearts prompts them to give."
    <br>Everyone whose heart prompts them - not whose circumstances prompt them,
    <br>not whose feelings, emotions prompt them.
    <br>Not whose pride or ego prompt them - no! Whose heart prompts them to give.
    <br>They may not be many but people of conscience are giving.
    <br>I mean, the right people - people who give genuinely, who give for the salvation of their soul.
    <br>And for such people, their giving is blessed of God.
    <br>They understand that principle in Acts 20:35 - "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
    <br>But wrong people always have to be reminded many times before they give because it is not from their heart.
    <br>What do I mean by wrong people?
    <br>Dubious people, corrupt people, people who steal, who do rituals,
    <br>who the source of their money, the source of their wealth is not good.
    <br>For such people, they have to be reminded many times before they give their offerings,
    <br>because it is not from their hearts.
    <br>What they do not realize is that tithes and offerings are things of the Spirit just as prayer is a thing of the Spirit.
    <br>Let us quickly talk about prayer
    <br>Faithless people have to be reminded to pray before they pray.
    <br>- Have you prayed today? 
    <br>- Oh no, I forgot to pray.
    <br>That's faithless people. But if you are people of faith,
    <br>faith people - their spirit prompts them to pray,
    <br>their conscience prompts them to pray because prayer is the thing of the spirit,
    <br>just as giving, offering and tithes my brother was asking about.
    <br>Giving is just like serving. Both should be done with joy, without being reminded.
    <br>You do not need to be reminded to do something that will give you joy.
    <br>Viewers, do I need to remind you before you do something that will give you joy?
    <br>No! It comes naturally.
    <br>So that is why I want,
    <br>viewers all over the world, you should be prepared to offer this prayer.
    <br>I want you to be offering this prayer:
    <br>Lord, help me by the power of Your Spirit to give.
    <br>Help me by the power of Your Spirit to receive.
    <br>Help me by the power of Your Spirit to ask so that I will not ask wrongly.
    <br>I have a question, I believe this question is going through minds of our many viewers watching.
    <br>How do we ask wrongly?
    <br>Very good question there.
    <br>The wrong people, corrupt people, dubious people, ritualists -
    <br>just because they are rich, we ask them. This is what we mean by asking wrongly.
    <br>Look, it is not that such people will not give - no, they give. But know this, viewers,
    <br>they give to be seen, to be heard, to be praised, to be noticed, to be admired, acknowledged, appreciated - here!
    <br>Take note of the word "here".
    <br>Their reason for giving cannot be of Heaven because their handwork is not of Heaven.
    <br>They receive praise here, that is why for such people if they fall into the hard times,
    <br>perhaps they become poor - such people will begin to write a letter to the church:
    <br>I am the one that paid for the generators in your church, I gave millions in tithes and offerings,
    <br>I have done this, I have done that. Now I am in hardship, I need help.
    <br>They will even begin to look for their refund for what they had given in the past
    <br>because it was not from their hearts.
    <br>Viewers, I want you to get this principle:
    <br>It is the force behind the money that is given that determines the kind of money it is.
    <br>In the same way, there is a force behind the man that determines the kind of man he is.
    <br>When we inherit stolen wealth, we would live under a stolen future, thereby mortgaging our future.
    <br>To conclude, I want to remind you viewers, of something Prophet T.B. Joshua said
    <br>during the Sunday service when he addressed this issue.
    <br>He said, "As a minister of God, I should know what it means to receive from you.
    <br>If I receive something from you, the source and the manner in which it is given,
    <br>determines whether it is a blessing or a curse that I receive from you."
    <br>That is why I am very careful in receiving from you.
    <br>because the force behind what you give determines what you give.
    <br>Ministers of God, we should allow people to bless the Church with their possessions.
    <br>How? Let them give as God prompts their conscience.
    <br>May God bless His Word in our hearts.
    <br>The atmosphere right now calls for a moment of prayer.
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, this is the time, this is the moment to engage our hearts with God.
    <br>Listen to your conscience now.
    <br>Let me ask you this question: Who needs forgiveness?
    <br>Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."
    <br>Whether we are the victim or the perpetrator, whether accused or accuser,
    <br>we all stand in helpless need of His divine forgiveness.
    <br>Whether you are the one that caused the problem or you are the one suffering the effects,
    <br>we all need forgiveness.
    <br>Right now, viewers, wherever you are, stop pointing fingers at others as the cause of your problems.
    <br>Stop thinking about your flaws or your mistakes.
    <br>Stop complaining about your limited education.
    <br>Wherever you are right now, let us pray.
    <br>Acknowledge your position before God as a sinner in need of salvation.
    <br>Lord, have mercy.
    <br>Grant us Your mercy!
    <br>Grant us Your salvation!
    <br>The earth is full of violence.
    <br>Don't abandon us, oh Lord!
    <br>Don't turn Your face away from us, oh Lord!
    <br>Show us Your mercy!
    <br>Son of David, speak forgiveness unto our lives!
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are right now, begin to release yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to release yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Release yourself from that pain of the past!
    <br>Release yourself from that bitterness!
    <br>Release yourself from that resentment!
    <br>Release yourself, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That root that keeps unforgiveness, bitterness, resentment, pain of the past alive in you -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command it to leave, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Viewers, I can see that peace flowing in your heart.
    <br>I can see that smile lightening your face.
    <br>I can see that joy of salvation restored.
    <br>How do we know we are forgiven?
    <br>Peace of heart is the inseparable result of forgiveness of sin.
    <br>As that peace is filling your heart right now, it is time to pray concerning your situation.
    <br>Whatever situation you are facing today that is not in line with God's will, we regard it as darkness.
    <br>That afflication is darkness.
    <br>That pain is darkness.
    <br>That failure is darkness.
    <br>That COVID-19, that virus is darkness.
    <br>I command darkness to come out of your life, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command darkness out of your life, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let there be light!
    <br>Let there be life!
    <br>Let there be freedom, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Are you restless during this lockdown period?
    <br>Receive rest, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Are you feeling heavy during this lockdown period?
    <br>Receive peace, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Are you troubled during this lockdown period?
    <br>Receive joy, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Right now, viewers, begin to confess the Word of God.
    <br>Confess the Word of God over your situation right now.
    <br>Confess the Word of God over your situation because the Word of God will never return without result.
    <br>Begin to confess the Word of God and thank Him right now.
    <br>Thank Him for holding your hand as you walk through these challenges.
    <br>Thank Him for holding your hand as you walk through these situations.
    <br>Thank Him for holding your hand as you walk through the troubles of life, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Viewers, it is well!!!
    <br>Sunday Live Broadcast From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>I believe Mr. Peter, wherever he is watching us has received the answer to his question.
    <br>I believe there is an area where we can shed some more light on.
    <br>Viewers, if you look at the natural law of seed time and harvest time,
    <br>if you look at the Biblical principle of sowing and reaping,
    <br>you will see that there is no giving without receiving and there is no receiving without giving.
    <br>Those who understand this principle give for the salvation of their soul.
    <br>I mean, they give from their hearts.
    <br>They give from all of their hearts.
    <br>You see, they have reason to give without even being asked because it is a mission, it is a vision.
    <br>God Himself speaks to their hearts to give; it is an inspiration of the Spirit.
    <br>Failing to give genuinely is failing God. And these people, they cannot afford to fail God.
    <br>A good example for us will be a situation we find ourselves in right now,
    <br>it is a situation that demands conscience.
    <br>I said it demands conscience.
    <br>You see, we must be led by the power of the Holy Spirit to ask so that we do not ask wrongly.
    <br>What do we mean? So that we will not ask someone who thinks that whatever they do for God in His Church
    <br>is a sacrifice in order to manipulate God into giving approval for their selfish, classic and material motives.
    <br>We must be led by the power of the Holy Spirit to ask so that those we ask will not see
    <br>the responsibility they pray in the Church as a means of bargaining with God to get what they want from Him.
    <br>What do I mean? I mean those who pray:
    <br>"God, I gave all the money I had to the Church instead of paying my house rent.
    <br>I gave everything I had to the Church instead of buying food for my family.
    <br>I gave my last dollar to the Church instead of paying my children school fees.
    <br>So now, God, you must answer me!"
    <br>People of God, giving an offering has now given us ground to dictate to God what to do and what not to do?
    <br>Paying tithes now gives us grounds to begin to control God?
    <br>Say, God my Creator, God my Maker.
    <br>Who gave us grounds to control Him?
    <br>The Bible clearly teaches us from Genesis to Revelation that man has a responsibility,
    <br>both to God and to man.
    <br>But if such a person fails in their responsibility to man and their case is taken to court,
    <br>they would say: "But I gave all my money to the church"
    <br>and the name of the church will be brought into such an issue.
    <br>This is not good for the ministry of God but this is what we see happening all over the world today.
    <br>Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians in the book of 2nd Corinthians 9:7 and I will read, 
    <br>"So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or
    <br>of necessity for God loves a cheerful giver.
    <br>Say, God loves a cheerful giver.
    <br>Yes, are you one? You see, if it is what you have purposed in your heart to give,
    <br>you will not begin to mention the name of ministry when you are faced with a challenging situation.
    <br>But if you find yourself bringing up the name of the Church, it means,
    <br>you didn't mean to give it to the ministry, it means, you didn't give it with all your heart.
    <br>Can you see what is happening to some people today?
    <br>Can you see the need for us not just to be a giver but to be a cheerful giver?
    <br>Angela, I believe, viewers would like to know, what do you mean by a cheerful giver?
    <br>Very good question, who is a cheerful giver indeed?
    <br>The Bible shows us that a cheerful giver is one who is happy and joyful before, during and after their giving.
    <br>There is someone who gives whether all that they have or a portion of what they have
    <br>with peace and contentment.
    <br>Not with murmur, complaints or despair because if you take a look back at your record,
    <br>you will see that whenever you give with despair, you receive with despair.
    <br>Whenever you give with complaint, you receive with complaint.
    <br>As the Bible says in Galatians 6:7-8:
    <br>"What a man sows, that he reaps."
    <br>If you sow to please the flesh, from the flesh, you will reap destruction.
    <br>But if you sow to please the Spirit, from the Spirit you will receive eternal life.
    <br>Is this not the joy of every Christian?
    <br>Complaining, murmuring while giving, giving with condition,
    <br>it leads to those kinds of situations where you begin to trace your problem back to the church 
    <br>or you stop going to the church altogether.
    <br>How many of these types of people do you know in your neighborhood, in your family?
    <br>How many of us are these very people?
    <br>Brothers and sisters, listen to the voice of God.
    <br>If it is something that you have purposed in your heart to give,
    <br>if it is something you are giving with all your hearts, it will bless you who give it and those who receive it.
    <br>Are you giving with all your heart?
    <br>Listen to the voice of God right now and become that cheerful giver, God so loves.
    <br>Let each of us give what he purposes in his heart to give for then our giving will be acceptable to God.
    <br>People around you want to change, they want to improve, they want to succeed with their lives,
    <br>but they just don't know how to go about it.
    <br>Realize now that giving with all of your heart can bring about that change in your life.
    <br>Viewers, I feel that we should bring our hearts to God right now and ask the Father,
    <br>Father, give me Your eyes to see those who need me most
    <br>and to identify how I can help.
    <br>Father, teach me to give with all my heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Our time of prayer must continue.
    <br>Viewers, we want you to take courage.
    <br>Your nation, city, economy, care may be locked down,
    <br>it may be in isolation, it may be in quarantine but your God is not locked down.
    <br>Your God is not locked down.
    <br>We are in a situation that demands the living God.
    <br>God Almighty can be in all places at all times through His Holy Spirit.
    <br>Prayer opens the door for God to enter and also drives out satan and all evil.
    <br>Right now, it is time to pray in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Whatever spirit that might have entered your life during this lockdown -
    <br>spirit of isolation, spirit of depression, spirit of laziness, spirit of  obesity - be cast out!
    <br>Be cast out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever spirit - spirit of depression, spirit of addiction, spirit of suicide - be cast out!
    <br>Be cast out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That spirit of hopelessness that entered your body, that spirit of addiction that tried to take you over,
    <br>that spirit of anger that tried to make you his home - be cast out!
    <br>Right now, begin to cast it out!
    <br>That spirit that entered your life during this lockdown,
    <br>that spirit that tried to make you his home - begin to cast it out!
    <br>Be cast out, in Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>Our government does not know that a lockdown is a  spirit; it is an evil spirit -
    <br>it is the spirit of violence, spirit of isolation, spirit of laziness, and spirit of suicide.
    <br>They don't know that people that used to surround themselves with many people
    <br>are now surrounded by only four empty walls.
    <br>People that never stood in one spot are now confined to one spot.
    <br>They don't know that this can lead to depression, suicide.
    <br>They are trying to protect us from the spirit of COVID-19
    <br>but they don't realize: What is COVID-19 compared with the repercussion?
    <br>I say, what is COVID-19 in comparison with the repercussion?
    <br>We cannot forget those we have lost due to this spirit of suicide.
    <br>If you look back, you will see a violent young teenager in the UK, who told his parents:
    <br>"I just can't stand the isolation of this lockdown, I can't stand the feeling of the wall closing in on me".
    <br>We can't forget the doctor in the United States giving all she had to care for patients of COVID-19.
    <br>We can't forget the father in India who became terrified
    <br>that his family would infect him with this virus, this COVID-19.
    <br>And they all became victims of the spirit of suicide.
    <br>I command that spirit of suicide - out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Our governments, leaders and presidents, you are doing good for the world.
    <br>You are trying to protect us from the spirit of COVID-19
    <br>but what you are protecting us from is not as dangerous as what you are pushing us to.
    <br>The economy must open, people must be allowed to go out, they need to be able to breathe the fresh air,
    <br>they need to interact, they need to go to work.
    <br>Many people, athletes - healthy people are now sitting at home,
    <br>they are discovering and developing sickness, terminal illnesses they never had
    <br>because they are not able to do that which was preventing disease, sickness.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, I command that spirit, that COVID-19, that virus -
    <br>be cast out, in Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>You can sense it right now.
    <br>You can sense the presence of God in your organs, lungs, tissues, heart.
    <br>You can sense the presence of God flushing out that virus, that respiratory disease,
    <br>that problem in your blood, that sickness, that fear.
    <br>Be flushed out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Right now, you can sense the presence of God bringing life, bringing healing, bringing victory.
    <br>Begin to rejoice in the light of God!
    <br>Rejoice in the freedom Christ gives.
    <br>As you continue in God's Word, in God's Spirit,
    <br>may God be a wall of salvation around you and yours, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank God for His Word that gives us life and victory, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I have a message for our partners but before, I have a song.
    <br>My head, my shoulders
    <br>My knees, my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>Thank you. Hallelujah!
    <br>That's for you! Amen?
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Partners all over the world, a million thanks are not enough to say thank you for your effort.
    <br>God has no hands but yours to do His work.
    <br>God has no help but your help to bring men to His Kingdom.
    <br>God has no house but your body is His temple.
    <br>God has no mouth but yours to tell others how Jesus died for them.
    <br>Jesus, in disclosing Himself as the One who heals, blesses, redeems, saves
    <br>has expressed His nature.
    <br>Jesus wants to express His nature and carry out His mission of love through you.
    <br>Money cannot make us partners in Christ but our heart can.
    <br>We are made in our hearts to be like Jesus.
    <br>Thank you, partners, all over the world for allowing God to use your faculties to express His purpose to others.
    <br>Remember, they are fatherless so that you can be their father.
    <br>They are lonely so that you can be their companion.
    <br>They are in want so that you can be their benefactor.
    <br>You don't need to be perfect to be used by God; you just need to be available.
    <br>Thank you for being available.
    <br>Christ's mission is our mission.
    <br>In the book of Mark 12:38-31,
    <br>when asked what was the most important commandment,
    <br>Jesus answered quoting the Book of Deuteronomy 6:4-5, saying:
    <br>It is not enough to believe in the unity of God; you must love Him supremely
    <br>and love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>You may have a neighbour who cannot pay his medical bills,
    <br>you may have a neighbour who cannot provide for his children,
    <br>you may have someone homeless in the street or a stranger in an immigration camp.
    <br>Don't forget - your neighbour can be your enemy;
    <br>your neighbour can be those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>The Book of Mathew 5:43-48 says, love them all.
    <br>This is the core of God's message to mankind.
    <br>Love them all.
    <br>Indeed, God measures our lives by our love for our neighbour.
    <br>Where our troubled world and its inhabitants find themselves today is as a result of lack of genuine love.
    <br>Lack of genuine love is what has put this world on the brink of hopelessness.
    <br>We fail to understand that love is the golden thread that unites, that links God's creation.
    <br>I am not complete without you, neither are you without me.
    <br>No one can succeed alone, we are a team.
    <br>I am because you are; you are because I am.
    <br>Live SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Partners in Christ, see what great change you can make in your community, your nation
    <br>and the world at large through your giving!
    <br>Remember, giving offers us the opportunity to reshape our destiny.
    <br>When you are helping the needy, you are servicing your life and reshaping your destiny thereby,
    <br>That is why we at Emmanuel TV are delighted to see our partners worldwide
    <br>reaching out with Christ's Spirit of love and hope for a better future
    <br>to those who say, "I am isolated! I am alone! Who can help me? Who can assist me?"
    <br>You that says, "Who can help me? I am isolated,"
    <br>remember the words of Jesus in John 1:48 to Nathaniel, who was in quest for life's purpose:
    <br>"...when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
    <br>This means earth has no sorrow that Heaven does not feel.
    <br>So, partners in Christ, as you are reaching out to assist those in need in this world
    <br>with the spirit of one purpose, I mean, in a godly way,
    <br>you are reminding this world that Jesus cares because Jesus sees.
    <br>Tell them, someone is watching them.
    <br>To that hurting and timid soul who says, "Who can help me?"
    <br>I say to you by faith - hear Jesus in the next room telling you, "I am sending someone to you.
    <br>Someone is on his way to you."
    <br>What an encouragement! What comforting words!
    <br>Brethren, the evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.
    <br>This is the reason why we ask our partners all over the world to send the recording of their acts of giving
    <br>so we can show it as a living testimony to others.
    <br>Because the Scripture says that giving offers us the opportunity to reshape our destiny.
    <br>Indeed, the work of love, giving you have done has changed the lives of so many.
    <br>And you begin to succeed in your life when other people's problems begin to matter to you.
    <br>This means, successful people are simply problem solvers.
    <br>Your positive example of love is a tremendous motivator for success.
    <br>Remember what Prophet T.B. Joshua says:
    <br>Living a lifestyle of purpose gives us an opportunity to leave our imprint in a positive way.
    <br>Thank you for joining us in changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.
    <br>Racine, before you go further, I want to ask you this very important question.
    <br>Apart from offering financial assistance, what other way can I give that can be compared to finances?
    <br>Good question.
    <br>Certain things are more rewarding than financial help.
    <br>To those who are lonely, comfort them.
    <br>Those who are discouraged, encourage them.
    <br>Those who do not know they are beautiful, tell them they are beautiful.
    <br>You know, those who are sad need to be happy to recover their beauty.
    <br>If you are sad and unhappy, there is no way your beauty can come out; there is no way you can be admired.
    <br>Therefore, encourage them to be happy even when there is nothing to be happy about on the outside.
    <br>Make them happy!
    <br>To those who are saying, they may believe that everyone in my house is poor,
    <br>everyone in my house is unsuccessful, tell them, let them know that everyone is not like you.
    <br>Tell them that everyone is different from you.
    <br>All they need perhaps, is to cut their hair, trim their beards or just to hear,
    <br>"You are valuable, you are beautiful, you are handsome."
    <br>These are the things you can do that are more rewarding than financial help.
    <br>Look at me, I never knew I was handsome until I met Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He gave me something in my life more valuable than finances; now I know myself.
    <br>Remember, beautiful people, are those who mirror Jesus.
    <br>Let the beauty of Christ be evident and seen in you.
    <br>Amen, thank you, Jesus.

    <br>Good Morning & Win Today
    <br>Everything good needs prayer!
    <br>Prayer is an acknowledgement that there is a superior realm that controls both visible and invisible worlds,
    <br>and Jesus is the Head of the community.
    <br>Remember, Jesus has come to deliver us spiritually, emotionally and mentally.
    <br>Never a yoke Jesus cannot break.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot remove.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in now that is tormenting your life -
    <br>I mean, whatever darkness, whatever spirit that is not of Jesus -
    <br>I speak to that spirit - be cast out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever situation being this lockdown, that lockdown.
    <br>Many people, my brothers and sisters, you were so industrial, so energetic, so active
    <br>working day and night doing this, doing that; phone calls, travelling all over the world
    <br>to make a difference in your life. But because of this lockdown you have become a shadow of yourself.
    <br>Laziness has come and that laziness leads to doubt and doubt leads to depression.
    <br>And depression leads to eating disorder and eating disorder leads to obesity. This is sickness.
    <br>That spirit behind that situation - I command it to cease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That spirit of depression - cease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That spirit of fear, depression - be cast out!
    <br>Be cast out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, begin to cast it out!
    <br>Cast it out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that spirit tormenting your life to leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be arrested!
    <br>Be caged perpetually, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I can see you being free!
    <br>I can see you being released!
    <br>I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Jesus has come to set us free from sickness and disease.
    <br>Whatever sickness, disease,
    <br>that virus, COVID-19 affecting your life, lungs, I say to that sickness - stop, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say cease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be cast out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be flushed out!
    <br>That virus in your lungs - be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>I cover you with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>I cover your spirit, soul and body with the Blood of Jesus. 
    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Say, thank you, Jesus, for making it possible for me to be healed!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Remember, Jesus has come to deliver us from lack and want and to bring the blessing of Abraham into your life.
    <br>His will for you is to prosper.
    <br>Right now, that barrier of limitation, backwardness - I command it to be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That yoke of limitation straining your relationship, in your marriage, business, career -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Hallelujah! I can see you being free!
    <br>I can see you being blessed!
    <br>Right now, begin to crown your blessing by speaking every good word.
    <br>Say, I am healed; Jesus is my Healer.
    <br>I am free; Jesus is my Deliverer.
    <br>Right now, I refuse to walk in poverty!
    <br>I choose not to live in poverty!
    <br>Even in unstable times, I live steady, I walk steady, I smile steady for Jesus is by my side.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank you Jesus for making it possible for me to be blessed.
    <br>You are blessed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen! Thank you, Lord.
    <br>Thank you so much, viewers all around the world.
    <br>Thanks for joining us in this wonderful section of prayer.
    <br>Remember that this prayer is not time-bound;
    <br>anytime you hear it on Emmanuel TV, it maintains the presence of God.
    <br>Once again, we would like you to send us your testimonies,
    <br>we know that you have spend your quality time with us here on Emmanuel TV
    <br>and we can't wait to share that wonderful testimony with you.
    <br>Remain blessed. From us to you, stay blessed in Jesus' name.
