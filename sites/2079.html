  <p>    
    <br>There is a gentleman here; you have pills. Can I call it a tablet, a drug?
    <br>You have suicidal thoughts.
    <br>The thought of killing does not mean anything to you.
    <br>You have made an attempt in the past, but you dropped it.
    <br>But this time around, you are very close to the grave
    <br>to the extent that you can think of buying a drug.
    <br>You just want to go; you are tired of everything.
    <br>Your loved one left you.
    <br>Please come forward. This is an attack.
    <br>You know Jesus loves you. Come on! Come out.
    <br>Please, come.
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>You don't have suicidal thoughts. You love your children. This is the one that I am talking about. Come here.
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>It is alright. Go and bring the drug.
    <br>I said, go and bring the drug - the drug you want to use to commit suicide.
    <br>In confirmation of the prophecy,
    <br>he makes his way out of the church to bring the drugs the man of God prophesied about.
    <br>My name is Mr Simon Izekor.
    <br>I'm the one the man of God prophesied about who wanted to use drugs to kill himself.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>It is true that I wanted to commit suicide
    <br>with this drug.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mr Simon Izekor.
    <br>This is my wife,
    <br>my son and my daughters.
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there is a man here who wants to commit suicide.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be 100% true because I am the one.
    <br>I came out the other day and I thank God that today I am alive, and not suicidal.
    <br>It goes like this:
    <br>Some time ago, I was having a financial problem, spiritual attack and everything.
    <br>In the dream I made love to women and did all sorts of things.
    <br>I was naked in the dream and ate in the dream.
    <br>All my businesses collapsed.
    <br>There was no business - nothing.
    <br>And I had the spirit of anger.
    <br>And what the man of God said is true.
    <br>My wife left me earlier this year because of that spirit of anger.
    <br>If we had a little misunderstanding, I would beat her.
    <br>I treated her like a punching bag.
    <br>Some time ago I almost killed her.
    <br>When my daughter said to me, "Please don't kill my mother",
    <br>I stopped beating my wife and now seriously beat my daughter instead.
    <br>Which one of them?
    <br>- This very one.
    <br>- Ok.
    <br>If you look here at the injury on her hand,
    <br>there was a time that I used a very terrible thing to hit her.
    <br>Each time you were beating your wife and she was there, and she tried to intervene, you would turn the anger on her?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Ok. That is how you injured her?
    <br>Yes, this is what the spirit of anger made me do.
    <br>In terms of business, I am a businessman.
    <br>All my businesses crumbled.
    <br>I had a total debt of millions of Naira.
    <br>I am an estate agent selling property.
    <br>I would sell a property to somebody, and at the end of the year
    <br>- maybe two to five years later - the problem would come.
    <br>I would start paying back,
    <br>and have to sell all my properties to settle debt.
    <br>I had to borrow money to pay my debt.
    <br>With all this going on, I became tired.
    <br>The day that my wife left me, we had a small misunderstanding and I beat her.
    <br>It was something small and she left me.
    <br>Before she packed her things, I left the house.
    <br>Armed robbers came to the house and attacked her.
    <br>They almost killed her.
    <br>This was a terrible thing. It was just God that rescued her.
    <br>Nothing was going well in my life.
    <br>Even to eat was a problem. She was the one taking care of my children.
    <br>That same day I felt that things were not good.
    <br>I went to go and meet her and said,
    <br>"Please, I have been alone since the beginning of this year. Please come back home".
    <br>She accepted and my family went to meet her and we begged her, and she agreed to come back home.
    <br>Before this time, she was still staying in her place that she rented.
    <br>Before last week, the thought just came to me, "Why are you alive? Just kill yourself now".
    <br>"Look at you. You are not the man you used to be. You are nothing. You don't have anything".
    <br>By this time your wife had not returned back to the home?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Ok. So, you were alone.
    <br>Yes. I was alone.
    <br>Those thoughts kept coming -
    <br>"You had a car, but you don't have one anymore",
    <br>"You used to take care of your children, but not anymore",
    <br>"You are now living alone".
    <br>You mean, you could hear a voice talking to you.
    <br>Very well - I could hear the voice.
    <br>The voice kept talking to me on that fateful day.
    <br>I went to visit my wife and to see my children.
    <br>Then, while my wife was talking to me, my mind was not there.
    <br>This voice said, "Leave this woman! Just leave her!".
    <br>"Just go and do what you want to do. Why are you doing this?".
    <br>"Very soon they will come and say, 'Pay your debt'".
    <br>I said, "Ok".
    <br>When I wanted to leave, my wife said, "Wait now. Where are you running to?".
    <br>I said, "I want to go".
    <br>She said, "Stay". I said, "No, I want to go home".
    <br>She now said, "Ok, go home".
    <br>When I got home, at about 10:30 pm, I was in my sitting room.
    <br>The thoughts came again, "You are in the room alone. Do it now".
    <br>I just went to my bedroom.
    <br>I had a gallon of acid.
    <br>What did you understand the voice was saying, "Do it now"?
    <br>- "Do it" - I should take my life.
    <br>- Ok.
    <br>"Very soon people would ask me to sell my house to settle my debt -
    <br>just so that they would not come and collect their money".
    <br>The voice was telling you that once you are dead, nobody will come and ask you for money?".
    <br>Exactly! They will not come.
    <br>I went to my room and picked up the gallon of acid.
    <br>When I looked at it, I said, "This one will be too hard for me".
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>I went to my bedroom and had a cup of drugs.
    <br>I said, "This one will be very easy".
    <br>I brought it out and got a cup of water.
    <br>I poured the drugs into my hand and before I knew it, my phone rang.
    <br>I had put forty tablets into my hand.
    <br>- Some tablets?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Was it a very strong tablet?
    <br>- Very strong - each tablet was 500 milligrams.
    <br>- 500 milligrams?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- So how many did you ...?
    <br>- Forty.
    <br>You put forty?
    <br>Yes, I just put it, so that after I poured water I would just [swallow] once.
    <br>I had just poured water into my mouth and my phone rang.
    <br>When I checked it, it was my wife - she called me, the phone was ringing.
    <br>Just when you were about to pour the tablets into your mouth?
    <br>Yes, the phone was ringing.
    <br>- Forty pills?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>The phone just rang.
    <br>I wanted to drop the phone.
    <br>Then I answered it.
    <br>I took the call, with the water already in my mouth.
    <br>I just swallowed the water to receive the call.
    <br>What I told her is, "Take care of my children".
    <br>- She said, "I should ...".
    <br>- I said, "Take care of my children".
    <br>She said, "What are you doing? What do you want to do?". She was just asking me. "You want to kill yourself?".
    <br>"You should remember, you read the Bible every time. So you want to go to hell fire?".
    <br>I ended the call.
    <br>I took more water.
    <br>The phone rang again.
    <br>She said, "Let me tell you, if you kill yourself you will go to hell fire".
    <br>Then I dropped the drugs.
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>She arrived at the house in less than five minutes, because she has a car.
    <br>She knocked on my gate.
    <br>I went down and opened the gate.
    <br>I was crying and she was also crying.
    <br>She said, "Why do you want to do this? ... these children?".
    <br>I said, "I am tired".
    <br>She said, "Only you can face this problem. Look at everything around you".
    <br>I have a photograph of my house - the whole problem.
    <br>She now took me to her own place.
    <br>She said, "Make sure tomorrow - that was Friday - that you go to The SCOAN".
    <br>You should make sure ...
    <br>She said I should come to Synagogue because ...
    <br>Your wife?
    <br>My wife. She said I must come.
    <br>I said, "If I come to The SCOAN and the man of God does not locate me, I will die".
    <br>"I will go back again".
    <br>She made the arrangements and gave me 20,000 Naira to make sure I came to Lagos.
    <br>Before then, my children were already in Lagos for a visit.
    <br>- That is how you came?
    <br>- Yes, when I came.
    <br>When I came on that fateful day, I was shocked and surprised when ...
    <br>I brought the drugs. That was when I said, "If man of God does not locate me with these drugs,
    <br>I will go back and take all of them".
    <br>To my greatest surprise, when I was on the gallery, the man of God said, "Come out".
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the King of Glory!
    <br>I want to thank the man of God for allowing himself to be used as a vessel of honour
    <br>unto Jesus Christ for him to deliver the captives,
    <br>of which I am one of them.
    <br>If not so, by today I would be rotting in the grave.
    <br>My name is Patience Izekor.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband and these are my children.
    <br>This man made me suffer a lot.
    <br>Different things happened, but I just thank God that God did it for me.
    <br>Thank God.
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>My name is Oyosa Izekor.
    <br>The man beside me is my father, and the person beside him is my mother.
    <br>I was in the church on that fateful day.
    <br>Although he has been trying to make attempts to commit suicide, I did not know of the recent ones.
    <br>You mean, just as the man of God said, that was not his first attempt?
    <br>- It wasn't his first attempt?
    <br>- No.
    <br>For almost a year now, we have been living separately.
    <br>I have been living with my mom and he has been living on his own.
    <br>He had this terrible spirit of anger.
    <br>Every time, for no reason at all, he would get angry.
    <br>Issues that should not be big, he would make them a big problem.
    <br>Then he would take it out on anybody who was close to him, most especially my mom.
    <br>In the process of that, I would say, "Daddy, take it easy. She is a woman. You cannot hit her like that",
    <br>but then I would get hit.
    <br>One time I even fainted and ended up at the hospital.
    <br>It was so painful.
    <br>I could not watch this kind of thing happen.
    <br>They grew apart and he left the house.
    <br>Then my mom was attacked and she left as well and rented an apartment. We were living together.
    <br>But he came begging and she accepted the apology.
    <br>Ok, now seeing that your dad is delivered from that suicidal spirit,
    <br>how do you feel as a daughter?
    <br>I feel very happy. I am so overjoyed.
    <br>I hope you realise now that he was under an influence
    <br>- all those things he was doing like beating up your mom, beating you up, inflicting injuries on you.
    <br>It wasn't him; it was a spirit that was controlling him that made him to do all those things.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>- So, you have forgiven him from your heart?
    <br>- Yes, I have.
    <br>What have you done?
    <br>I have forgiven him from my heart.
    <br>Ok, let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>The whole church and my people here, sincerely with my heart,
    <br>I have to apologise to my wife and my daughter for the way that I treated them.
    <br>No man should treat his family like that.
    <br>I really apologise from the depth of my heart.
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>Tell us, after your deliverance last Sunday, does any such negative and suicidal thought still come to your heart?
    <br>Before this advice I said that I just have to give God the glory
    <br>for the life of our father in the Lord, Prophet TB Joshua, for allowing him to be used as a vessel.
    <br>Because, if not for Prophet TB Joshua, by now I would have been rotting in the grave.
    <br>Since that day, I now know that there is a life to live.
    <br>Hallelujah. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>There is now nothing worth dying for - no problem, no situation that God cannot handle.
    <br>Because Jesus has died for us.
    <br>He has died for us. That is why He shed His blood on the Cross of Calvary.
    <br>We should follow Him.
    <br>There is no reason for us to kill ourselves.
    <br>I am advising the whole world, and the people looking at me now
    <br>- they will be surprised - I am telling them to move closer to God.
    <br>God is the beginning and the end. Thank you.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>The word of advice that I have for people in this church and people watching us on Emmanuel TV:
    <br>Stay close to God. There is nothing that God cannot do.
    <br>He will change everything about you when you stay close to Him.
    <br>And now that God Almighty has delivered you and delivered this family,
    <br>from this terrible spirit of suicide,
    <br>we pray that God Almighty will give you the grace to make His Word the standard for your life, and also for your family,
    <br>and as you do so, this deliverance that you have received
    <br>will pave the way for greater blessings to come in your life, and in this family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You Are Very Close To The Grave
    <br>SUICIDAL MAN SAVED BY PROPHECY!
    <br>Now I will go back home to settle with my husband. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
