    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Cocaine addiction! She's addicted to cocaine!
    <br>For eight years, she has not graduated. She has gone to four universities.
    <br>We have gone to four rehab homes. We cannot do anything.
    <br>I can't even preach. I can't even do my work, Man of God.
    <br>Are you a minister of God?
    <br>Yes, Man of God. I am down. We don't know what to do, Man of God.
    <br>That's why I ran to you. I know you are my spiritual director.
    <br>Man of God, help me! Look at the specimens here in my hands.
    <br>This is a sample of the cocaine and marijuana she has been taking.
    <br>I SLEPT WITH A MAN WHO TURNED INTO A BEAST!!!
    <br>She has been staying in the cocaine bunks.
    <br>She has sold all our things. We are now poor because of this.
    <br>She steals money anywhere she sees it.
    <br>If she doesn't see money, she would carry our appliances, equipment and everything else.
    <br>We would then need to go and pay ransom. I am tired of paying ransom!
    <br>We have gone everywhere. We even owe some doctors. Man of God, help me!
    <br>This has been going on for eight years.
    <br>I SLEPT WITH A MAN WHO TURNED INTO A BEAST!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>My family is delivered. My daughter is delivered from addiction. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Joy Odey. I am from Cross River State, and I stay in Abuja.
    <br>What brought me to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations was cocaine and marijuana addiction.
    <br>For eight years I have been taking these substances and it has ruined my life, and done so many things to me.
    <br>It all started when I was in school. I started at 100 Level in university in Abuja.
    <br>I went to school to study Electrical Engineering.
    <br>I didn't know that my roommate was doing drugs.
    <br>One day she invited me to go out with her.
    <br>We went out and we met people who were doing drugs.
    <br>I was so naive. I didn't know what was going on.
    <br>She asked me to try it and I did.
    <br>Since then it has been hell for me.
    <br>I was into it for three years and almost did it every day at school.
    <br>It stopped me from going to lectures. Even when I went to lectures, I did not concentrate.
    <br>I would sleep in class or excuse myself and leave because I was under the influence of cocaine or marijuana.
    <br>It happened that I did drugs for three years and my family did not know about it.
    <br>When they found out about it, it became a problem in the house for me.
    <br>They tried very hard to help me.
    <br>They took me to rehabs, different churches and different places - I can't even count - just to seek help to stop.
    <br>It cost me a lot because I entered university to study a course of five years,
    <br>but I still haven't been able to complete the course in eight years.
    <br>It got bad after three years when I had run out of money.
    <br>There was nothing for me to use anymore, so I started stealing from the house.
    <br>I would steal iPads, phones or laptops just to feed my addiction.
    <br>I sold these items for some time.
    <br>After that, when there was nothing else to sell in the house,  I indulged in the Internet.
    <br>When I posted pictures, men would want to meet up with me at and I would charge them.
    <br>I would then sleep with them just to get money.
    <br>That was what my life was all about - it was just drugs all day. I couldn't concentrate on anything else.
    <br>It was causing problems with my family at home; there was no peace.
    <br>This brought so much shame and disgrace my way and it made me very uncomfortable. I was not happy at all.
    <br>The one experience I had was when I met a man.
    <br>He took me to his hotel room and while I was sleeping, he transformed and changed into a beast.
    <br>That scared me a lot. I woke up and jumped up from the bed.
    <br>I was so scared. I didn't know what to do.
    <br>But eventually God helped me.
    <br>The man calmed down, because I think he was going to use me for a ritual.
    <br>That was the event that was going to take place, but God helped me that day.
    <br>Even with that experience you had,
    <br>you still went back into the drugs, you still moved around with men and slept with men?
    <br>Yes, it did not stop me from doing it. Instead, the problem doubled - the drug addiction got worse.
    <br>No matter the situation or experience I had, I still went back to taking drugs.
    <br>Finally my family found out and we had been trying for years to get me off the drugs, but to no avail.
    <br>My mom and my sisters started watching Emmanuel TV at home, and they saw the miracles that were taking place.
    <br>My mom decided that we were going to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Initially I did not want to come; the demons and evil spirits in me were trying to stop me from coming.
    <br>But eventually I came.
    <br>There was a time when we were supposed to come, but I left the house just to go and get drugs to take,
    <br>because I didn't think I was going to be able to stop or quit.
    <br>Eventually we came to The SCOAN, joined the prayer line and the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Since then I have not had any cravings.
    <br>I have not even thought about it. It is not in my mind anymore to take drugs.
    <br>I SLEPT WITH A MAN WHO TURNED INTO A BEAST!!!
    <br>To God be the glory! Shall we put our hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
    <br>for what the Lord has done in the life of our sister - transforming her life.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Apostle Ann Ugbo. I live in Abuja and the girl standing here is my beloved daughter.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations was drug addiction.
    <br>I want to say that God is in this altar.
    <br>Are you in this place?
    <br>The God of Senior Prophet TB Joshua, my spiritual director, is God indeed.
    <br>I want you to put your hands together for this wonderful God!
    <br>I SLEPT WITH A MAN WHO TURNED INTO A BEAST!!!
    <br>The problem started eight years ago.
    <br>As you can see, Joy is a very pleasant girl.
    <br>Joy had a dream of becoming a pilot.
    <br>In her secondary school when she graduated at the age of 17, turning 18, she had one of the best results.
    <br>She was the school's general prefect and she graduated as the best all-round student - well behaved and academically.
    <br>Based on this, she said that she wanted to be a pilot.
    <br>My husband now said, "What course will lead you to become a pilot?".
    <br>The nearest course was engineering.
    <br>She thought she could go to aviation school in Syria,
    <br>but my husband said, "No, it is good for you to have a first degree,
    <br>and then after that you can go to aviation school or aeronautics and continue from there".
    <br>We took her to the university in Abuja, which is a private school,
    <br>where we were paying nothing less than 2,000,000 Naira a year.
    <br>As naive and innocent as she was, she had a roommate at the school - as she told us - who introduced her to drugs.
    <br>During the first year, her first semester result was ok.
    <br>During the second semester, we discovered that she had started having problems.
    <br>During the first semester of the second year she was having problems.
    <br>Then we had to visit the school to find out what the problem was.
    <br>The counsellors did all they could to see how they could help her.
    <br>We discovered that the second semester of year two was not ok.
    <br>She then moved on to year three.
    <br>It was worse. She did not even write the first semester exams, and that was it.
    <br>When we discovered that she was taking drugs, we withdrew her from the boarding house,
    <br>and told her she would have to study from home.
    <br>We monitored her going to school
    <br>and discovered that some days, when she went to school, she would not end up at school; she would go out.
    <br>When the problem became too much we realised that she was losing weight and getting thinner and thinner,
    <br>we sought the services of a rehab home.
    <br>We took her to the first rehab. She co-operated a little.
    <br>When she came back home, she relapsed.
    <br>We took her to a second rehab home and the same thing happened.
    <br>We then took her to a third rehab.
    <br>After that we took her back to school, but we changed universities.
    <br>In fact, she did not attend lecturers at all at the second university.
    <br>When we discovered this, we took her to a very far university outside Abuja.
    <br>They said that she had to start from year one.
    <br>So, somebody who was in year three of their studies, about to go to year four now, was demoted to year one.
    <br>We said, "Ok". She stayed there for year one and year two.
    <br>During year three the problems started again.
    <br>I was even called to come and take her home.
    <br>So, that is how we took her back to Abuja.
    <br>Children of God, it is not a pleasant experience to have your loved one, even your worse enemy, involved in drugs.
    <br>She was not only addicted to marijuana, but cocaine and even crack.
    <br>Those who know drugs, know the danger.
    <br>When we brought her home, I was praying and crying and said, "I don't know what to do".
    <br>She said that she wanted to go back to the first school.
    <br>We went back there and they said that they would take her back and she could continue from year three.
    <br>We said, "Ok, no problem". We even paid some money.
    <br>The day we paid the school fees was the day we finally saw her.
    <br>She just went. She did not go to school. She was out.
    <br>And it took prayer and fasting for us to locate her.
    <br>After all this, we said, "What are we going to do?".
    <br>Like she said, we prayed, we fasted, we went from one place to the other.
    <br>The prophets and pastors would say, "This girl is a star. She is a prophetess. She has a call of God", and all that,
    <br>but how to cast out the demon or the problem, was a problem.
    <br>Women and men of God, that is how we continued.
    <br>I want to tell you that for us to come here was by the special grace of God.
    <br>When we discovered that she was into addiction, we kept an eye on her.
    <br>If she went out and came back,
    <br>we would do a search and you saw some of the things we discovered in the video as evidence.
    <br>We saw her take cocaine.
    <br>I have seen cocaine in its natural form through her.
    <br>We saw her take marijuana.
    <br>Joy would sit down with us and we would discuss things very pleasantly,
    <br>but we did not know when Joy left the house and where she went.
    <br>As she said, she went to places, but the main place she went to was The Bunk.
    <br>Children of God, The Bunk experience is what broke me.
    <br>I SLEPT WITH A MAN WHO TURNED INTO A BEAST!!!
    <br>We believe these are actually tears of joy, because all those things are things of the past.
    <br>And today we want to glorify our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
    <br>for restoring your daughter back to her original position - how the Lord Almighty created her.
    <br>When she went to The Bunk there were all manner of people there.
    <br>If you did not have money, you would give yourself in order to get the substance.
    <br>Apart from that, like she said, she engaged in taking our equipment.
    <br>We don't have any laptops, phones or iPads in our house anymore - even televisions. She took everything.
    <br>If she saw the ATM card she withdrew all the money from the account, just to take it to that place.
    <br>She even took handbags and jewellery - anything valuable - there just to be able to get cocaine.
    <br>This is what she did.
    <br>I remember when it became too much, we took her to the last rehab home in chains - the picture is on my phone.
    <br>She managed to escape and left the rehab.
    <br>Nobody knows how she did it; it remains a mystery.
    <br>She kept on like that.
    <br>She was always a very respectful girl, but when Joy came back to the house she started insulting and fighting.
    <br>If you tried to advise her, she would abuse you - it didn't matter whether it was me, her father or her siblings.
    <br>We had planned four times to be at The SCOAN, but she escaped.
    <br>After that I told my pastor what had happened.
    <br>He said, "It is time now for you to go and see Papa (Prophet T.B. Joshua)".
    <br>We then left with her, and when we told her where we were going, she ran.
    <br>We had to start fasting; the church had to fast for us to be able to locate Joy.
    <br>We have been watching Emmanuel TV. It is permanently on in our house.
    <br>The one day I saw a boy from Abuja who was healed of addiction.
    <br>I saw another girl from America who was also healed.
    <br>When she left, we now did a video on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We were there sleeping where Emmanuel TV was on, until the next day.
    <br>After the second day, she came back and said that she would follow us to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>I SLEPT WITH A MAN WHO TURNED INTO A BEAST!!!
    <br>When we were in the prayer line, I could see that she was afraid
    <br>and ashamed telling me, "Mommy, you want to come and disgrace me here again".
    <br>I said, "The devil is the one that has disgraced us all these years and today is the final battle.
    <br>Let us all go there and disgrace ourselves there".
    <br>When Papa (Prophet T.B. Joshua) was coming, I cried to him,
    <br>I said, "Please, you should help me because this girl has really been a problem.
    <br>As you can see, I am a pastor, but I cannot do my work,
    <br>because if I am not at home, Joy will fight everyone and will go".
    <br>Only her senior brother and I can control her. I can't move, I can't do anything. I can't even pray".
    <br>When we came that day and I was crying,
    <br>to God be the glory, Papa (Prophet T.B. Joshua) heard my cry.
    <br>As soon as Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, my spiritual director, lifted up his voice,
    <br>he commanded that evil spirit out and that evil spirit obeyed.
    <br>And that is how it has been - right from that day until today she has not thought of the addiction.
    <br>Before that day, at the hotel, she was smoking every day. She would smoke in the morning and in the evening.
    <br>I just cried, "God, how can a mother handle seeing her loving child doing these kinds of things?".
    <br>I could not help her. I could not do anything.
    <br>But on that day! Senior Prophet TB Joshua, God will bless you.
    <br>This problem has taken me everywhere; this problem has wrecked us.
    <br>We have gone to hospitals; we have gone to many places because of this.
    <br>The last place that she went to, the doctor kept her for three weeks
    <br>and then he said that she ran out.
    <br>She was not cured, but we still had to pay.
    <br>So, for you to have saved us, God to have used you to save us from this problem ...
    <br>Because of this problem, our whole family was in shambles - my husband, my children, everybody was in shambles.
    <br>The only problem that we had, that brought us poverty, was this case of Joy.
    <br>I don't want to say how much money has been taken away from us.
    <br>The people in The Bunks in Abuja know me. They cry and follow me.
    <br>Everybody said, "Look at this fine girl", but there was nothing that we could do
    <br>until we came to The SCOAN to Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>To God be the glory! Shall we put our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ?
    <br>My advice to the youth is that they should stay away from drugs.
    <br>It doesn't pay. It only brings you shame, disgrace, depression, pain and reproach.
    <br>So, my advice is that you should stay away from it and if you are doing drugs and you need help,
    <br>and you have been to so many places, come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>God is here and He has delivered me, and I believe that He will deliver you too.
    <br>You mean, they should seek God and look for a living church so that they can receive their deliverance as well.
    <br>We thank God Almighty. We thank you for that wonderful advice,
    <br>and we also want to advise you that remember as God Almighty has delivered you and set you free,
    <br>make sure you make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Let God's Word channel you. Let your heart and mind be filled with God's Word,
    <br>so that, that deliverance you have received will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Emmanuel! Children of God, celebrate with me.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>If you know what I was going through, you will understand what I am saying now.
    <br>I want to advise everybody - those seated here and those watching on Emmanuel TV - this is the place to be.
    <br>I am a minister, but I am here.
    <br>I came here because anointing powers anointing. Prayer powers grace.
    <br>Don't sit back.
    <br>The man, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, has been given to Africa - to Nigeria, in particular - for free.
    <br>Why do we sit down and die?
    <br>I am calling on all Nigerians - this is time for you to come.
    <br>There is no problem that cannot be solved here.
    <br>We went everywhere. They said an addiction case cannot be healed.
    <br>They said that addiction is for life.
    <br>But today, I am standing here to give glory to God that my daughter is free!
    <br>Wherever you are - it doesn't matter whether you are a bishop, a pastor, a prophet - please come here.
    <br>This is a man that God has ordained for our generation!
    <br>Can you rise up and give God the glory for our Papa (Prophet T.B. Joshua)!
    <br>I SLEPT WITH A MAN WHO TURNED INTO A BEAST!!!
    <br>We thank God Almighty. We know our mother is actually overjoyed for what the Lord has done in her life.
    <br>What seemed impossible, God Almighty has made it possible in the life of this family.
    <br>And that is why we see our mother overjoyed and advising us that we should seek God Almighty
    <br>because there is nothing impossible for God to do;
    <br>there is nothing impossible for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ to do in our lives.
    <br>Mother, we also want to encourage you.
    <br>Remember, God's Word has healed, delivered and set your family and your daughter free.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life and continue to draw your strength from God.
    <br>We believe that God Almighty will definitely see you through in all your endeavours, in Jesus' name.
