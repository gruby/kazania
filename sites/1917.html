    <br>You can see what a mighty result we would achieve if God's servants and medical doctors work together.
    <br>God is God of nature.
    <br>If God's servants work with medical doctors, there is no limit to what they can achieve.
    <br>God's servant will be able to say if a patient will come out successfully from doing the operation.
    <br>The treatment too.
    <br>Before I was able able to say, "Go" for the young one, I had seen 'to and fro'.
    <br>Already I had seen the 'to and fro' - I had seen that he would pass through the operation and come out of it.
    <br>If doctors were also able to talk with such language to the patient, "Go ahead", the operation would succeed.
    <br>We find ourselves where we are today because we are unable to work together.
    <br>This is not the first person we are sending [for medical treatment].
    <br>I could count up to 100 people - we have sent various people to India, United States, UK, South Africa...
    <br>When a patient is before me, I will ask God, "What do you want me to do, Sir?"
    <br>If God says, "Do this", the remaining part, that is not for me, "Take him to such and such a place" - 
    <br>I know my boundary.
    <br>I must have a boundary because I am not God; it is only God who does not have a boundary.
    <br>He does not have a beginning and He does not have an end.
    <br>I have a beginning and I have an end.
    <br>When it comes to issues like this, I am a servant.
    <br>I can only do what I am given to do; I cannot do more than what is given to me.
    <br>It is what I am given that I do; I will not do beyond what I am given.
    <br>So I am His servant, I say, "Yes, Sir!" - that is me.
    <br>Working together is amazing!
    <br>Working together - God's servant and medical doctors, God's servant and scientists.
    <br>Working together makes things easier - you will have the mind of God in whatever you are doing.
    <br>This is simple.
    <br>God's servant and economists - no matter what you study about economics, you need to ask God's opinion.
    <br>So, this is an example of working together - God's servant and medical doctors; this is what we have seen.
    <br>When someone is in the operation room, God's servant will be in an attitude of prayer throughout the operation,
    <br>so that the doctor will not be the one that even does the operation, God will only use his hand to do the operation.
    <br>IF GOD'S SERVANTS AND MEDICAL DOCTORS WORK TOGETHER...
    <br>When someone is in labour, about to deliver a baby, while she is delivering,
    <br>God's servant will be in an attitude of prayer while the doctor will be there.
    <br>God will be using his voice and his hand to do whatever he is doing.
    <br>We have changed the whole thing; we have gone beyond our level, our border.
    <br>What you are doing now, you have gone beyond your border.
    <br>If you check what you are doing, you have done beyond what God asked you to do.
    <br>That is why there is mistake and error.
    <br>If you are able to do exactly what God has given you to do, He will see you through.
    <br>But when you are going beyond what you are given to do, you pay the price,
    <br>and that is the price the whole world is paying now.
