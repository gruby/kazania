  <p>    
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm well - thank you, Sir.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Where you were living before, you are no longer there.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>Where you were before, you are no longer there.
    <br>You just left. Transition.
    <br>You want to leave your husband; you are already in the process of divorce.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>I'm in the process of divorcing, man of God.
    <br>I just left my home.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>You have to receive counselling before you take this step.
    <br>In your home, divorce, divorce and divorce.
    <br>That's true, man of God.
    <br>You are the only person who has a stable home.
    <br>That’s very true, sir.
    <br>And two; internet – I want to advise you over it.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Linda Ejiogu.
    <br>I am a South African married to a Nigerian.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave me last week Sunday was on point.
    <br>The first thing he said to me was that I had moved houses.
    <br>What was happening was that there was a spirit of divorce
    <br>that is in my family and there was transition in my life.
    <br>He mentioned something about the internet.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God said is very true because on 9th February 2014, I moved out of my marital house.
    <br>I had been living there with my husband of 17 years.
    <br>I left the house because he had been very abusive to me all these years.
    <br>He would threaten to kill me, to pour acid on me.
    <br>He would hit me in front of my kids.
    <br>He has done many things to me; he would stab me.
    <br>I don’t even buy knives in my house because I am scared of him.
    <br>He always threatened me; he has a very big problem with anger.
    <br>And other things; they were not major things to me to leave the marriage, but cheating...
    <br>He has cheated on me; he is a serial cheater.
    <br>He has numerous girlfriends in South Africa and in Nigeria.
    <br>There is nothing he doesn’t do.
    <br>Married women, single, young, old, he is following them.
    <br>Since 2004, he took away my daughter.
    <br>I brought the child here to Nigeria; I came with her.
    <br>That girl, I left her in 2006.
    <br>We are talking of reconciliation.
    <br>I would not want you to go too far.
    <br>I think my brother is around.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Let me see my brother; I don't want you to go too far.
    <br>We are talking of reconciliation.
    <br>You have said your own story.
    <br>If my brother is around too, he has his own side of the story.
    <br>My brother, thank you for honouring me and coming here today - thank you very much.
    <br>Thank you, man of God. It is a pleasure to see you.
    <br>Let him stand here.
    <br>Do you have any other thing you want to say?
    <br>I do, man of God.
    <br>What I want to say is that I have a daughter here since eight years now.
    <br>And this child...
    <br>It was an argument between him and I
    <br>that she would come here to attend school and learn the culture.
    <br>Since then, I have not seen my child.
    <br>It is all right.
    <br>Let me hear from my brother here.
    <br>Don't cry, don't begin to get sympathy to your side.
    <br>It was God Almighty that brought up this matter.
    <br>You came to The Synagogue on your own and you were here for a different thing.
    <br>You carried a placard; what was written on the placard was different from what I was telling you.
    <br>You never put it on the paper that this was your problem but you had a different problem.
    <br>When I got to you, I was telling you what was not revealed on the paper.
    <br>So, it is God now that is talking.
    <br>OK?
    <br>If God can bring such a secret story out, the same God should tell you people the outcome.
    <br>OK, brother - I want to thank you for...
    <br>After the prophecy was given and I asked her where her husband was,
    <br>she said he was in South Africa, isn't it?
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>I said, "I want to see your husband".
    <br>Thank God, you say he is a Nigerian - he cannot hear my voice and say he would not come.
    <br>Immediately we made a call to the man, he came, just because of the prophecy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Just because of the prophecy and you know the marriage is broken already.
    <br>There is nothing like marriage any more but just because he heard me talking.
    <br>He said, "No, I don't need to go there, the woman is no longer my wife, what am I going to do?
    <br>But please, I have to be there because the man of God is calling me".
    <br>So, thank you for that.
    <br>Let's hear from you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chief Maxwell Ejiogu.
    <br>I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I reside in South Africa.
    <br>I have been in South Africa for 17 years.
    <br>The lady beside me here is my wife.
    <br>First of all, before I go into detail, I would like to thank God who made it possible
    <br>for me to be here today through the prophecy given to my family
    <br>through our humble man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I thank you so much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>OK, you say our sister beside you is your wife or ex-wife - what are you saying?
    <br>She is still my wife as of now.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Because he has the fear of God, and for him to say that...
    <br>OK, let's hear.
    <br>Without wasting much of our time, I would like to go into detail.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave us is true.
    <br>I have the documents here.
    <br>It is a confirmed prophecy.
    <br>I have heard what my wife said.
    <br>The issue is that I love my wife.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My sister - thank you.
    <br>As I was saying, since I met my wife in 1997, the first problem we had was alcohol.
    <br>There is a hotel that is called Mimosa.
    <br>She asked me to take her there.
    <br>I took her there.
    <br>When she was drinking, I told her that I wanted to go and sleep. Let us go.
    <br>She attacked me with a bottle of beer.
    <br>I am a kind of person who is shy; I just pretended and went upstairs.
    <br>She followed me.
    <br>She took a bottle and attacked me, took a chair and hit me on my head.
    <br>OK, when she was under the influence of alcohol... ?
    <br>- Alcohol.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>It was not her; it was when she was under the influence of alcohol.
    <br>There are two people now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are two people talking.
    <br>When she was under the influence of alcohol, she attacked,
    <br>but when she is not under the influence of alcohol, she is a good woman.
    <br>OK, thank you - go ahead.
    <br>Since that day, fighting over alcohol and smoking never stopped in my family.
    <br>I had endured it for 17 years but this thing did not stop.
    <br>She mingles with people who are divorced.
    <br>If I told her something, she wouldn’t listen to me.
    <br>When she is under the influence of alcohol.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>She goes out in the morning...
    <br>OK.
    <br>You know this is not the way you married her.
    <br>You never saw her under the influence of alcohol when you married her.
    <br>Yes, I never saw her.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>You too have some blame.
    <br>You married somebody who you never saw under the influence of alcohol.
    <br>Suddenly, when she started living with you, she started taking alcohol.
    <br>Where were you when she started this?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>OK, you can leave the issue of alcohol.
    <br>We know what anyone can do under the influence of alcohol.
    <br>They can even do worse than what you are talking about.
    <br>Forget about being under the influence of alcohol.
    <br>Tell us the other side of the story, sir.
    <br>Thank you for your coming once again.
    <br>Man of God, sometimes, she would go out in the morning
    <br>and come back the following day, 1 or 2 am.
    <br>She would be drunk and driving my kids.
    <br>When I talked, the next thing she would do was to call the police.
    <br>She would tell me that the women of South Africa have got the right, 50:50.
    <br>That would hurt me.
    <br>I would tell her, "Listen, before I married you, I told you that I have culture.
    <br>You knew that I am a traditionalist and a titled man, respect me.
    <br>I don’t like a situation where I give you a law or tell you, "don’t do this
    <br>and you do it a hundred times, that makes me angry and I have a hot temper."
    <br>When I started enduring this, enduring that, there would be an extent where I would not be able to take it any more.
    <br>Fighting would burst out.
    <br>She had been taking me to court and putting me in jail.
    <br>Sometimes, I would be in for one week, three days without eating inside the cell.
    <br>She would be able to do whatever she wanted to do inside the house.
    <br>Afterwards, my brother would have to beg her so that she would release me.
    <br>In the police station?
    <br>In the police station.
    <br>OK, you went to the station - you were in the prison for how many days?
    <br>Sometimes she could put me in police custody for three days, sometimes one week.
    <br>And what makes me angry so much - I love my kids, I don't play with my kids.
    <br>OK, thank you, uncle.
    <br>My daughter, thank you.
    <br>There is something you said that crowns it all.
    <br>You said, "She is my wife".
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>And you love her so much.
    <br>I love her so much.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The person you love so much and the person that is your wife
    <br>is the person that is not under the influence of alcohol.
    <br>Here is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>She needs deliverance, you need deliverance.
    <br>After the deliverance we will have our real persons, our real value.
    <br>Your real value - you will discover it. 
    <br>Her real value - she will discover it.
    <br>Now, the love you are talking about is still there.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So now, all the story - we realised that our sister here was under the influence of alcohol,
    <br>that is why all those things were happening.
    <br>It is not her.
    <br>It is that spirit - so, therefore, it is not her.
    <br>Like I have said - when you met her and married her, you never saw her as a drunkard.
    <br>It was when she got to your house, in one way or the other, she saw you taking alcohol but not so much of it.
    <br>But a little boy - when you show him how to jump, he will begin to jump more and more.
    <br>That it is.
    <br>So, I want to tell you, thank you very much for the love you have for me.
    <br>I want to come to this marriage.
    <br>God is here.
    <br>I want to tell you, this marriage is from God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is from God.
    <br>After the deliverance, I will pray with you people.
    <br>I want to meet you people for a discussion, to let you know that
    <br>please, let us put our past behind us and more forward.
    <br>It is not by accident you met him; it is not by accident you met her.
    <br>This is a marriage.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever she must have done to you in the past, please put it behind you.
    <br>OK?
    <br>The Lord that said, "Thou shall not drink alcohol", also said, "Thou shall not smoke, thou shall not fornicate".
    <br>If you have drunk alcohol, you have fornicated...
    <br>So please, let's put everything behind us and move forward.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>We shouldn’t look at the wrong; let us look at what God says about the wrong.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't look at the wrong; listen to what God says about that wrong".
    <br>God sometimes uses the wrong to speak to us, to teach us a lesson
    <br>and to prepare us or to strengthen the marriage.
    <br>God will sometimes allow that wrong to happen in order to strengthen the marriage.
    <br>It is misunderstanding that mostly strengthens the marriage.
    <br>When you see any wonderful marriage today -
    <br>if you know how many misunderstandings they have gone through
    <br>before they established that solid and wonderful marriage.
    <br>They have gone through the valley of shadow of death.
    <br>There is no marriage that grows strong by understanding.
    <br>Misunderstanding will come many times before understanding.
    <br>There can be no understanding without misunderstanding.
    <br>There can be no understanding without what?
    <br>[Misunderstanding.]
    <br>There can be no right without wrong.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[There can be no right without wrong.]
    <br>There can be no right without wrong.
    <br>[There can be no right without wrong.]
    <br>There can be no understanding without misunderstanding.
    <br>[There can be no understanding without misunderstanding.]
    <br>Please, I want to meet you people.
    <br>If I allow you to talk, sir - I think we will just continue to repeat ourselves.
    <br>I know you want to answer her; she says you had many concubines...
    <br>You want to answer her by saying she has many boyfriends...
    <br>If I'm right...
    <br>You are right, Man of God.
    <br>What are we going to say about that?
    <br>You have many concubines - you too, you have many boyfriends.
    <br>You have many bla - you too have many bla.
    <br>So, we know, you continue to repeat yourself - because you have stated those points
    <br>you want to answer her.
    <br>Please, let's put everything behind us.
    <br>Thank you, my sister.
    <br>Thank you for coming.
    <br>I want to thank you for just accepting my call.
    <br>I want to join this marriage.
    <br>You people have to wait for me; you will go to the prayer line.
    <br>I know the worst has happened.
    <br>The same worst will now bring the best.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Yes. Therefore, let everybody go and sit separately for now
    <br>because they have been sitting separately, they never came together.
    <br>So, they have to do the same thing until prayer line.
    <br>After the prayer line, I will be the one to bring them together.
    <br>OK, uncle - you can go back to your seat here.
    <br>[Thank you man of God.]
    <br>You go back to your seat.
    <br>It's too soon to begin to say, "Hug yourself".
    <br>No, that is not an issue of a hug.
    <br>There are issues on the ground already.
    <br>So, we have to discuss before we hug.
    <br>Man of God, please I want you to collect this divorce summons from me from the High Court.
    <br>My sister, come out.
    <br>Can you see what I'm talking about?
    <br>There is a court issue already.
    <br>There is a divorce order against me.
    <br>By my sister?
    <br>She filed it.
    <br>This one is for the children’s court.
    <br>It is still going on.
    <br>This one is for the divorce.
    <br>It is still going on. There is another one…
    <br>No, it's alright.
    <br>You know I said, that I could not ask you to hug here .
    <br>For you to know that I know what is on the ground...
    <br>After the deliverance I still need to sit with them.
    <br>We are in the mid-way.
    <br>OK, here is my sister, you are my brother.
    <br>Give me, I will give it to my sister.
    <br>My sister will give me.
    <br>Help me to hold it.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Help me to hold it, my sister.
    <br>You keep it for me.
    <br>Go and sit down.
    <br>My sister, come here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know what happened?
    <br>My sister collected it and...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She will give it to me.
    <br>After the prayer, I will collect it back.
    <br>We will discuss, I will answer, "What happened? You have gone too far".
    <br>Divorce already - you have sent the divorce documents.
    <br>You will be the one to go ahead and do the rest.
    <br>She will go and withdraw it by herself.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>I said I could not ask them to hug themselves because I know there are many issues to be settled.
    <br>Suddenly they come here saying there is a divorce letter.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Linda Ejiogu.
    <br>The gentleman standing next to me is my husband Maxwell Ejiogu.
    <br>Beside him is our first daughter, after her our son and his auntie - my husband's older sister
    <br>that takes care of them.
    <br>You are very welcome once again.
    <br>Can you just recount to us the first day you came here - you received that prophecy.
    <br>Tell us once again what the man of God said to you and how that word of prophecy was true for your life.
    <br>As I was standing in the prayer line, I had that expectation within me
    <br>because I knew exactly what I came here for.
    <br>On the placard I had put what was written on the medical report.
    <br>But you cannot hide from God.
    <br>God knew how I was feeling at that time.
    <br>He had to come to us through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God told me exactly what was happening in our lives.
    <br>That day - it was about three weeks after my moving out.
    <br>I had filed for divorce.
    <br>He said that the spirit of divorce was in my family - which was very true.
    <br>I was the one who was still married - it's very true.
    <br>He spoke to me and told me everything that I knew.
    <br>I was not in shock though because I knew he is a real man of God.
    <br>I prayed to God that He would speak if this marriage was really from Him,
    <br>God would come through for us - for me to be able to save the marriage.
    <br>After the prophecy, by the grace of God, your husband was invited to The SCOAN.
    <br>He flew all the way from South Africa.
    <br>Tell us what happened last week during the service, when the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua addressed this issue.
    <br>During the service when I had to testify, the man of God called my husband who then confessed his love for me.
    <br>That was something that I knew, and he knew that I loved him too.
    <br>My husband mentioned his own grievances to the man of God.
    <br>From then...
    <br>The thing that caused all this he was talking about - my drinking, going out,
    <br>I drove with my kids while being drunk and all that - it was because of loneliness.
    <br>I felt rejected and I would just leave the house and go out.
    <br>When I saw him here last Friday, we were not even talking, we stared at each other.
    <br>After the deliverance, something strange happened.
    <br>The anger I had...
    <br>The way I felt just changed.
    <br>I felt peace within me.
    <br>I had that urge - this marriage can still work, we can still do things right.
    <br>I thank God for The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV, because without it, we wouldn't know that there is a living God.
    <br>Our kids would have been raised like us - which I fought against my whole life.
    <br>I wanted my kids to be raised by myself and my husband as a family.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Madam, during the course of the service last week, after yourself and your husband had explained the challenges
    <br>you were facing, the man of God made a statement that it was deliverance that you and your husband needed,
    <br>and that this was indeed a marriage from Heaven.
    <br>Now, can you just testify - ever since you received prayer from the man of God at the prayer line,
    <br>and God revealed that in the service - what are the changes that you've seen in your relationship
    <br>with your husband in this week, and what do you want to testify about that?
    <br>From Monday we started to have conversation, and it was more calm, in the sense that he could listen,
    <br>I could finish my sentences without him biting my head off.
    <br>We started talking, communicating very well.
    <br>There is an open communication now, whereby I can explain something to him and he would listen attentively
    <br>and acknowledge that he had heard what I had been saying.
    <br>God has delivered us and it is permanent, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Tell us; ever since the deliverance, do you still have that urge to smoke or drink or go outside?
    <br>Well, since the deliverance I don't have the urge for anything.
    <br>I'm calm, I'm at peace with myself.
    <br>Those things happened when I was angry - I just snapped - I was like, "Well, let me just go out there".
    <br>But now, I'm very much at peace.
    <br>I really thank God for delivering us.
    <br>How have you been sleeping ever since that deliverance?
    <br>I sleep really peacefully.
    <br>I find it easy to sleep.
    <br>I don't turn and toss, start thinking of the way forward or way back.
    <br>I just believe that all is well with me and my family.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Finally, last week, publicly the divorce letter was brought out and the man of God actually handed it over to you.
    <br>Tell us - what is your decision concerning that particular letter.
    <br>Well, the divorce papers are with me right now.
    <br>When I go back to South Africa...
    <br>They were issued from the High Court in Pretoria.
    <br>When I go back now, I will speak to my lawyer and I will withdraw the divorce
    <br>because I know that our marriage has been healed.
    <br>We are looking forward to greater things, and peace and harmony.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almighty, how God has truly intervened in this marriage and thank God, through this word
    <br>of prophecy and the deliverance that came with it, the couple is no longer going to go through divorce
    <br>but is going to continue to live together in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Indeed, this is the power of prophecy.
    <br>We give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Finally, madam, I believe with the experience you have passed through in this marriage,
    <br>you have a lot of advice and lessons for people to learn from.
    <br>What is your advice to people watching you right now, especially to married couples?
    <br>What I would advise is: seek the face of God and the foundation of the marriage is very important.
    <br>We got married when we were very young.
    <br>There was no proper foundation, there was no God there.
    <br>I think that people need counselling before they get married.
    <br>They need to know God, they need to know what they are putting that marriage into.
    <br>Right now, I believe that our marriage has a new foundation.
    <br>I thank God for the prophecy, for the generosity in this place, for the love that was given to us.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Right now, we would like to hear a few words from your husband as well.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome.
    <br>If you could introduce yourself to us and tell us your own experiences and your own testimony.
    <br>My name is Maxwell Ejiogu.
    <br>First of all, I thank God Almighty who made it possible for us to be here.
    <br>Last week, when we were here, I was standing here with my wife
    <br>but we were not able to look into each others' eyes.
    <br>Today, we can look into each others' eyes.
    <br>So...
    <br>I thank God for that and I thank our Prophet T.B. Joshua who described the problem in the family.
    <br>Because to me, I had already decided to welcome this divorce.
    <br>She knows me.
    <br>It can take me a minute to decide what I want to do.
    <br>She knows what I am capable of.
    <br>But God saw it and picked it and dealt with it - glory be to God.
    <br>Tell us, sir, ever since you spoke out last week in the service...
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua said it was deliverance
    <br>that was needed both on your side and on her side.
    <br>He prayed for both of you.
    <br>What are the changes in your relationship with your wife ever since then?
    <br>That last Sunday, when I came here, when I had a handshake with the man of God, I felt something;
    <br>something happened in my life.
    <br>At the beginning I was very angry with my wife and I said that there was nobody who could change my mind.
    <br>I told her, she knows; that as long as you have already given me these summons, I'm fine.
    <br>After my handshake with the man of God, I felt something.
    <br>My anger started to reduce.
    <br>I couldn't know what to say any more so I just kept quiet.
    <br>When he said that this marriage was from Heaven, I was finished, I couldn't...
    <br>Since that day the man of God conducted the deliverance for both of us,
    <br>to be honest, I'm very calm; I'm no more stressed.
    <br>I don't think of worldly things.
    <br>I'm okay.
    <br>We can talk, we can interact, we can relate now.
    <br>We can share ideas.
    <br>I believe everything is normal as husband and wife.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>What a wonderful testimony.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for restoring and reconciling this marriage.
    <br>Indeed, only our Lord Jesus Christ could do this.
    <br>Right now, sir, your wife has just said that she is going to withdraw that divorce letter.
    <br>How do you feel hearing that?
    <br>I felt good because the order is from above; she has to do it.
    <br>So, I'm happy that she is withdrawing the summon.
    <br>Hallelujah. We thank Jesus Christ for indeed restoring this marriage.
    <br>We can actually see that you have your children here.
    <br>We just want to hear a quick word from your daughter as well.
    <br>Sister, tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Ejiogu Ngozi.
    <br>What can you say about what Jesus Christ has done for your parents?
    <br>I am so happy for what Jesus Christ has done for me because
    <br>when I heard that my father and mum wanted to divorce, I felt so sad and I felt like crying.
    <br>But right now?
    <br>I feel happy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>To the glory of God, we want to encourage this family, now that they have made the Word of God
    <br>the standard for their lives - they must continue to stay close to Jesus.
    <br>We can see that our mother here is crying tears of joy knowing that God has finally reconciled this marriage.
    <br>We want to encourage you to continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives,
    <br>as you do so, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Maxwell Ejiogu & Family
