  <p>    
    <br>Open your lips now and pray with me.
    <br>Merciful God,
    <br>merciful Father,
    <br>I acknowledge my guilt.
    <br>Have mercy on me. Prayer.
    <br>I COMMAND RESTORATION!
    <br>Mass Prayer With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Whatsoever that has been taken away from you will be restored today, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it your health, the area of your health,
    <br>area of your business,
    <br>area of your finances,
    <br>in the name of Jesus,
    <br>I command restoration, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatsoever that has been taken away from you will be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your business - be restored!
    <br>In your career - be restored!
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>You are not the one that offers this prayer.
    <br>I am praying for you, just as our Saviour prayed for the disciples.
    <br>I just need your agreement.
    <br>Listen once again.
    <br>You have asked for mercy and have acknowledged your guilt.
    <br>You have asked for mercy and the Son of David has shown mercy on you.
    <br>Whatsoever that has been taken away from you, in your health, business, career, finances, marriage -
    <br>I command restoration, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Do you know what it means for a prophet of God to command restoration?
    <br>I don't know that area, but Jesus knows.
    <br>Whatsoever that has been taken away from you,
    <br>that has been taken away from your life,
    <br>your business,
    <br>your finances,
    <br>your health,
    <br>in the name of Jesus, I command restoration!
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Begin to command restoration.
    <br>Say: Son of David, restore me!
    <br>Restore my business!
    <br>Restore my health!
    <br>Restore my finances!
    <br>Restore my marriage!
    <br>I COMMAND RESTORATION!
    <br>Mass Prayer With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>He is the Restorer, our Saviour,
    <br>the Repairer, the Roadmap, the Lord Jesus.
    <br>Ask Him to repair your business.
    <br>Ask Him to repair your way.
    <br>Ask Him to repair your finances.
    <br>Ask him to repair your career,
    <br>your marriage, your destiny,

    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>He is the Roadmap.
    <br>He can show you the way.
    <br>When He shows you the way,
    <br>you have direction.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: When He shows me the way,
    <br>I have direction,
    <br>I have purpose,
    <br>I have focus,
    <br>I have a goal.
    <br>Say: Roadmap, show me the road,
    <br>show me the way,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command your career,
    <br>your finances,
    <br>your marriage,
