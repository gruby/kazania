    <br>There was no way for Moses, if the Red Sea was not divided.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>There was no way for Moses, if the Red Sea was not divided.
    <br>Moses was at the crossroads.
    <br>He looked here, he looked there, there was no way.
    <br>The only way was to cross the Red Sea.
    <br>In the same way, many of you are at the crossroads; there is no way.
    <br>In any area of your life that you find difficult to penetrate,
    <br>I want you to raise your prayer mantle, prayer sword and begin to part, divide
    <br>and make a way where there is no way.
    <br>Are you ready with me?
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>I cant hear you.
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>You know your prayer has a sword.
    <br>When you raise the voice, confession of The Holy Spirit, it is a sword, a weapon
    <br>that can divide and make a way where there is no way.
    <br>You just need this Word.
    <br>I am going to anoint your word - every word you are going to speak, I am going to anoint it.
    <br>Every word you are going to speak at this moment - be anointed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every word that will come out of your voice, your utterances - be anointed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When your word is anointed, you can divide and make a way where there is no way in your business
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your career
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your finances
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your health
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your career,
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your marriage.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to talk right now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I anoint your word!
    <br>The word that will come out of you - be anointed!
    <br>From now, the Word that will come out of you - be anointed!
    <br>Because you don't believe yourself and you don't believe you can part, you can divide,
    <br>you don't believe you can walk with your word,
    <br>you don't believe you can open with your word.
    <br>I anoint your word. Be anointed!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
