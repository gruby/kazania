    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua moves in the midst of the people, prophesying into their lives,
    <br>as the communicator between the visible and the invisible world.
    <br>As he continues to prophesy, he encounters this woman.
    <br>This is a baby girl.
    <br>I want to see you. Go and wait for me.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Jovita.
    <br>Beside me are my husband and my baby.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Last year, 2012, I was pregnant.
    <br>On December 23rd, we came for the service.
    <br>During the service, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua walked up to me and said, "I can see a baby girl."
    <br>Meaning that I would give birth to a baby girl.
    <br>Before then, I was thinking of going for a scan.
    <br>After the service, I went back to hospital to confirm the prophecy.
    <br>The scan result was that of a baby girl.
    <br>This year, on the second of March, I gave birth;
    <br>the same prophecy still came to fulfilment.
    <br>This is the baby girl.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My advice to everyone is that there is nothing impossible for our God to do.
    <br>Are you listening to that?
    <br>The woman is telling you that your case is possible.
    <br>Say to the woman, "Thank you."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Thank you.]
    <br>She is telling you, your case is possible.
    <br>She is not the one that is talking; God is using her tongue, her voice to communicate.
    <br>He is telling you, your case is possible
    <br>and I am expecting you to agree immediately and say, "Thank You, Lord!"
    <br>Thank you, madam, for allowing yourself to be used.
    <br>If you receive a word of prophecy, always believe that it will come to pass, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The woman is telling me that God says I should talk to you.
    <br>Are you ready to hear your prophecy?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The way out for me has come!"
    <br>Face your neighbour, "The way out for my family has come!"
    <br>Face your neighbour, "The way out for my business has come!"
    <br>Face your neighbour, "The way out for my finances has come!"
    <br>I cannot hear you. The way out for my destiny has come!
    <br>The way out for my career has come!
    <br>Say, "The way out for me has come!"
    <br>Laugh Louder In Jesus' Name | Prophetic Prayer With TB Joshua
    <br>I want to believe that you cannot hear me clearly - I will repeat it.
    <br>Because the way you laugh - you don't laugh louder.
    <br>I want to hear a crazy noise!
    <br>Laugh Louder In Jesus' Name | Prophetic Prayer With TB Joshua
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>In the story of blind Bartimaeus; the Bible says there was a multitude of people.
    <br>Multitude means they could not give a number; there were thousands of people.
    <br>Imagine, the voice of one person among thousands of crying people.
    <br>But it was his voice that reached the Heavenly Father.
    <br>That was a crazy noise.
    <br>Can I hear your crazy noise?

    <br>She said your case is included.
    <br>Say, "My case is included."
    <br>Say, "All things are possible, including my case."
    <br>She said it is possible; you will be delivered today.
