    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>I am Arodis and I am from New York.
    <br>I went to the crusade because I was depressed and anxious, and I had suicidal thoughts,
    <br>so I wanted to be delivered and cured.
    <br>When I was younger, I suffered from depression
    <br>and during high school I could not connect with people or trust people.
    <br>Eventually when I went to college, my depression got worse,
    <br>and I had suicidal thoughts.
    <br>I felt that I was not worthy of anything.
    <br>I dropped out of college and I gave up on life.
    <br>All I did was stay at home and I was anxious.
    <br>At the age of 18, I went to a mental health facility
    <br>and they diagnosed me with anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder.
    <br>I wanted to get cured and I tried so many things.
    <br>This led me to practising witchcraft, trying to know the future and reading tarot cards.
    <br>Nothing helped; nothing cured me.
    <br>People prayed for me, but I was still depressed and believed that I could not be cured.
    <br>I recently hurt myself and I have scars on my arms because I believed that I had deserved it.
    <br>I made all of these cuts on my arms on one day.
    <br>My depression got worse and I hated myself, until now.
    <br>You had cut yourself to the point of bleeding heavily.
    <br>Yes, I cut myself until I bled very heavily.
    <br>I took pictures and I showed them to my mom.
    <br>She was very worried about me, so she told me to attend The Dominican Republic Crusade with her.
    <br>When I was younger it was frowned upon to like witchcraft or anything like that because my parents were Christians.
    <br>My sister and I were very curious,
    <br>so we would read books about spells and experiment with them.
    <br>This led to us reading tarot cards for each other, going to witchcraft stores and buying many witchcraft things.
    <br>We would then read tarot cards for each other and other people.
    <br>They would ask a question and I would shuffle the tarot cards.
    <br>Each tarot card would basically determine the future of the person, based on the question asked.
    <br>I always admired weird things.
    <br>I intentionally watched movies that were witchcraft themed.
    <br>I had heard about Prophet TB Joshua before
    <br>and my mom wanted me to attend the crusade because I said that I was depressed and wanted to be hospitalised.
    <br>So, I went to The Dominican Republic Crusade.
    <br>They kept telling me testimonies about how God has used Prophet TB Joshua to cure many people.
    <br>At first I was hesitant.
    <br>Then we attended Day 1 of the crusade.
    <br>When I was in the stadium, I was very scared to be close to Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>After he prayed for me, I felt better.
    <br>Ministration Of Prayer & Deliverance
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Man of God, I need help.
    <br>I practised witchcraft. I am from New York, and I suffer from suicide and depression.
    <br>Ministration Of Prayer & Deliverance
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>She said that she is from the USA and she has thoughts of suicide and she is also involved in witchcraft.
    <br>Once he touched me, I blacked out, I fell to the ground shaking and I was scared.
    <br>When I got up, I felt as though every pain, everything I had ever dealt with, was gone.
    <br>When I walked, I felt happy and perfectly fine. All my problems had disappeared.
    <br>So in that moment the depression, the spirit of suicide, witchcraft just left you.
    <br>Yes, everything left me and I feel perfectly great and happy.
    <br>Now I pray.
    <br>Ever since the crusade, I pray before I go to sleep and I constantly talk to God.
    <br>Previously, I did not pray.
    <br>But now I feel so happy and I don't feel alone anymore.
    <br>I don't feel depressed or scared anymore,
    <br>and I can finally live my life.
    <br>Wow. Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give all the glory to God for this wonderful deliverance in your life.
    <br>What would be your word of advice especially to those who may still be having a similar problem -
    <br>depression, suicide, or even those who have practised witchcraft.
    <br>What do you really want to tell them based on this new life that you have experienced after your deliverance?
    <br>Definitely to look for God, because He is the only One who can cure you.
    <br>No matter what you do that is bad, God will always help you and cure you of whatever you have done,
    <br>and He will never judge you.
    <br>Regardless of whether you think you deserve it or not, you do deserve it and you should look for God to help you.
    <br>We thank God for your life
    <br>and we pray that you would maintain this deliverance by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>And we believe the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
