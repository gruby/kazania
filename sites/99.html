  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities
    <br>which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen, right now.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>it is time to receive.
    <br>East, South, West, anywhere you are -
    <br>underground, in the air, on the sea, wherever you are;
    <br>receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I break sin's power over your life!
    <br>I break sin's power over your life,
    <br>over your marriage,
    <br>over your home,
    <br>over your family,
    <br>over your children,
    <br>over your career,
    <br>over your destiny!
    <br>Be broken!
    <br>SIN'S POWER OVER YOUR LIFE, BE BROKEN!
    <br>Prayer with T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I say, "Sin's power over you, be broken,"
    <br>I mean, whatever sin might have brought to your life.
    <br>Poverty, affliction, setback, sickness, disease -
    <br>whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to those things,
    <br>I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers at home, say to sin, say to sickness:
    <br>I disconnect myself!
    <br>Poverty, I disconnect myself!
    <br>Setback, disappointment, I disconnect myself!
    <br>Take a step out of that.
    <br>I am out of poverty!
    <br>Step out!
    <br>Begin to step out!
    <br>Step out!
    <br>Say: Poverty, I am out!
    <br>My past is over!
    <br>You sickness, you are a stranger!
    <br>Out of my life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Move!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say: Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God
    <br>as you send your testimony.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
