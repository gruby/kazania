  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>My testimony is this:
    <br>My name is Mata Williams.
    <br>I am 54 years old.
    <br>I am a mother of six children.
    <br>I am from Bradford, UK.
    <br>I was going up to Glasgow from Bradford to hear my daughter in a performance.
    <br>It's five hours by train.
    <br>This was on January 22nd, 2011.
    <br>The next day as I was travelling back, at 4pm I started feeling violently sick;
    <br>I was vomiting and having diarrhoea for five hours.
    <br>I vomited all the way down to Bradford.
    <br>By the time I arrived there, I was very weak.
    <br>I thought that maybe it had finished, that I couldn't vomit anymore
    <br>and that there was nothing left in my body.
    <br>Then when I went home to lie down, a new case of vomiting started.
    <br>This time it felt as if my intestines were coming out of my body
    <br>and I didn't know what to do.
    <br>It was 12 midnight, so I called my children to bring me my laptop.
    <br>I knew I was dying but I thought at least let me find somebody who could pray for me.
    <br>So, I told them to find 'Christian healing'.
    <br>When they searched on YouTube, Prophet T.B. Joshua's face appeared.
    <br>He then started praying; he prayed very strongly.
    <br>As he prayed, my body started to shake.
    <br>Then he said, "Touch the screen". So I touched the screen,
    <br>and my body was going crazy in the bed.
    <br>Then after that...
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I knew that I couldn't get to a hospital because there wasn't enough time;
    <br>I knew that I was actually dying and this was the only chance that I had to live.
    <br>God was speaking to me that I needed to be prayed for.
    <br>As the prophet was praying for me, I didn't know who this person was.
    <br>He was just praying strongly.
    <br>After that, he said to me, "Get up!"
    <br>He told everybody to 'Get up!'.
    <br>So, I got out of my bed and then I felt some strength come inside my body
    <br>and this huge monster or whatever it was, leaving me.
    <br>I was surprised because I had been lying in bed all this time, I couldn't move
    <br>but then through the internet, Prophet T.B. Joshua was telling me
    <br>to get out of bed, to 'Get up'.
    <br>So, I got up, went to the bathroom and looked at my face.
    <br>I had lost so much weight from my body.
    <br>I looked at my face and I saw the mask of a skeleton.
    <br>I then realised that this life and death situation was just by the grace of God...
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Through this man of God, I am alive today.
    <br>I never saw him before in my life.
    <br>The next day, I got my children to find out who he is, where he's from, what's his church.
    <br>They found out he is in Nigeria.
    <br>So I thought, "I want to go and thank him".
    <br>I thank God for this.
    <br>I am indebted to God and to Prophet T.B. Joshua that I am alive today.
    <br>It's a very big privilege.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Have you listened to that?
    <br>Through YouTube.
    <br>Just like that.
    <br>She never knew that this was from Nigeria.
    <br>But after the prayer, the solution came,
    <br>and she then said, "Let me look for (this church)".
    <br>That's all - YouTube!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
