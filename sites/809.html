    <br>This woman has come 
    <br>to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations
    <br>with the problem of difficulty 
    <br>in walking due to rheumatoid arthritis
    <br>and she's using a wheelchair for the past 7 years.
    <br>You can see the bandage tied around her 
    <br>knees which she uses to reduce the pain
    <br>she encounters on a daily basis.
    <br>This is the wheelchair she uses every day 
    <br>to move from one place to another
    <br>because she cannot walk with her legs.
    <br>Her family members demonstrate the difficult task of carrying her into the wheelchair
    <br>in order to move her around.
    <br>Jesus Christ healed and still heals all manner of sicknesses and diseases.
    <br>Never a sickness, He cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease, He cannot cure.
    <br>Never a healer like Jesus Christ.
    <br>My name is Diane Ebele Okeke.
    <br>I am from Abuja.
    <br>I'm 30 years old.
    <br>I cannot walk due to rheumatoid arthritis,
    <br>which has affected all of my body
    <br>and I am now confined to a wheelchair.
    <br>I have been having this sickness - rheumatoid arthritis - for the past seven years.
    <br>I have been confined to a wheelchair for the past four years because I cannot walk.
    <br>I have tried all solutions to no avail.
    <br>I have gone to different hospitals, prayer houses, churches, herbalists
    <br>but there was no solution.
    <br>It has affected me to the extent that I cannot do my house chores.
    <br>I have a small baby. I am supposed to nurse my baby ordinarily
    <br>but it is my husband who is helping me to bathe her
    <br>and my sister helps me to feed and take care of her.
    <br>I can't do anything on my own. I can't bathe. I can't even feed.
    <br>I am a graduate and this problem started after my youth service.
    <br>Since that time, I'm not happy
    <br>because I can't do anything on my own.
    <br>I can't even finish my career.
    <br>It started when I was 23 years old - seven years ago. Now, I am 30.
    <br>For the past seven years, I have been at a standstill.
    <br>Nothing - I can't do anything.
    <br>I'm not happy because when I see my age mates and see where they have reached,
    <br>I feel so sad.
    <br>She has come to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations
    <br>with the belief in her heart that with just a touch from Jesus Christ
    <br>through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>she will get made holy in Jesus' name.
    <br>Her sister demonstrates how she pushes her from one place to another in the wheelchair
    <br>due to this problem of rheumatoid arthritis.
    <br>I believe that by stepping into this place, the arena of liberty,
    <br>she will be healed. She will not go back the same.

    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>You're my last hope, Man of God! I am dying!
    <br>For the past seven years, I cannot walk. I have been using a wheelchair for the past four years.
    <br>I'm from Abuja. Man of God, help me! I'm dying!
    <br>I'm too young for this sickness. Man of God, I can't carry my baby.

    <br>My name is Diane Ebele Okeke.
    <br>I'm from Abuja.
    <br>I could not walk due to rheutmatoid arthritis for the past seven years.
    <br>I had been to different places - hospitals, native doctors, different churches
    <br>but I could not get a solution until I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I could not hold anything with my hands or carry my baby.
    <br>I could not to my house chores. My husband had been doing everything for me.
    <br>I could not cook, wash clothes or eat because it affected my gums and teeth.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me today!
    <br>I came all the way from Abuja with my sister to The SCOAN.
    <br>I had been using the wheelchair for the past four years.
    <br>My sister introduced me to Emmanuel TV and I have been watching it.
    <br>She told me that we should come to The SCOAN because it was Prophet T.B. Joshua's birthday.
    <br>I had the opportunity to be registered and right now, I can walk.
    <br>I could move, after the man of God touched me.
    <br>I am healed; thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for healing me today!
    <br>Thank You for using the man of God, T.B. Joshua, to wipe away my tears of seven years.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>For the past four years, I had been on a wheelchair.
    <br>I could not move or do anything.
    <br>After my service, this problem of rheumatoid arthritis started, seven years ago.
    <br>I started having pain all over my body and joints.
    <br>I could not move my hands or fingers.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My sister has been healed!
    <br>My name is Madu Veronica.
    <br>She is healed now and she can walk.
    <br>She had not been walking for four years.
    <br>This sickness had been holding her down for the past seven years.
    <br>She could not do anything in the house except with the help of her husband.
    <br>Sometimes, when I visited her, I would help out.
    <br>She has a small baby in Abuja that she could not do anything for.
    <br>She could not even breastfeed her.
    <br>We came all the way from Abuja and thank God we came to the arena of liberty
    <br>and she is healed by the prophet of our time.
    <br>She is healed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Diane Ebele Okeke.
    <br>I come from Abuja (Nigeria).
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of rheumatoid arthritis,
    <br>which affected my whole body - my joints, neck, legs and knees.
    <br>I could not walk for the past seven years
    <br>and I was confined to a wheelchair for four years.
    <br>I had been to different hospitals from 2009, when I finished my NYSC
    <br>but there was no solution.
    <br>They gave me all kinds of medications and the pain became worse.
    <br>This affected me that I could not conceive anymore.
    <br>All the drugs they gave me did not work; they caused me stomach pain.
    <br>They told me that I would not be able to conceive again.
    <br>I had been praying to God to show me the solution.
    <br>I had been to different hospitals but there was no solution.
    <br>The pain affected me so much that I could not do my house chores or carry my baby;
    <br>even when I gave birth to my baby, it was by the grace of God that I managed to give birth to her.
    <br>After delivering her, I could not breastfeed or carry her.
    <br>My husband helped me to do all the house chores with my sister beside me.
    <br>I could not dress myself or cook; I could not do anything by myself.
    <br>Then, I decided to go to church.
    <br>I went to different churches and prayer houses, all to no avail - no solution.
    <br>My sister called me to say that I should go to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty,
    <br>to finally get my solution.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN from Abuja and the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Immediately the man of God prayed for me, I felt an electric shock
    <br>and all my whole body began to vibrate.
    <br>I didn't know what was happening
    <br>until he said, "Stand up and walk!"
    <br>I stood up and started walking.
    <br>I don't know how to thank God.
    <br>Come on - you can do better than that! Put your hands together!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Mrs Diane Ebele Okeke
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>What a God of miracles!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: What a God of miracles!
    <br>What a God of miracles!
    <br>As a young lady, for the past seven years, since I was 23, I had not been happy.
    <br>But today, I thank God that I can do what I could not do before.
    <br>I am so happy that I can use both of my hands to dress myself again.
    <br>I can eat, unlike before when it affected my teeth and jaw.
    <br>I am so happy that I am healed.
    <br>Amen. Well, indeed, we want to rejoice with you.
    <br>Can you walk to the glory of God, in the midst of the children of God?
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>Mrs Diane Ebele Okeke
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>That is the very lady who received her healing in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Walking freely to the glory of God!
    <br>My name is Madu Veronica.
    <br>The lady beside me is my sister.
    <br>The man at the other side is our uncle.
    <br>The problem started seven years ago.
    <br>She called me on the phone and said that both knees were hurting her.
    <br>I thought it was a normal pain until, as time went on, the pain got worse.
    <br>It affected all her joints and her whole body.
    <br>She could not do anything by herself, except with the help of her husband, house help
    <br>or me, whenever I had the chance.
    <br>It affected her so seriously that she could not even bathe herself.
    <br>I knew that immediately she would step on this land, she would not go back the same.
    <br>Mrs Madu Veronica (Diane's Sister)
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>We had gone to various churches, hospitals and herbalists but no solution was found.
    <br>In fact, people of God, I used to watch these things on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>This is our first time of coming here.
    <br>Yesterday, I was right behind her, looking at her.
    <br>The man of God prayed for her and touched her.
    <br>The next thing I saw was that she started vibrating.
    <br>I was so joyous and happy.
    <br>I want to tell you that yesterday, when we got home, she started sleeping.
    <br>She slept like a baby from 7pm, when we got to our hotel, till 9am.
    <br>This is something she could not do before.
    <br>This morning, I was expecting her to call me
    <br>but I had told myself that if she called me to help her put on her clothes, I would not.
    <br>Fortunately, she did not call me because she dressed herself. I thank God!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Madam, what can you say concerning this miracle?
    <br>How can you describe the miracle that took place in the life of your sister?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I told my sister, "Let's go to the arena of liberty".
    <br>I want to tell you that Prophet T.B. Joshua is the prophet of our time.
    <br>With what I saw yesterday, I am so happy.
    <br>It's real; it's not magic, it's not rocket science - it happened live.
    <br>You experienced it live and direct.
    <br>It happened in the life of your family; indeed, it happened in the life of your sister
    <br>and you witnessed first-hand that Jesus Christ is real.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Right now, we want to hear from your sister once more.
    <br>How is your body now? Are you still experiencing those pains that you had before?
    <br>No, I'm free; I can do what I could not do before.
    <br>I can raise my leg, I can shake my body and neck; I can do everything I could not do before.
    <br>Oh, hallelujah! Clap for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Indeed, whom the Son of God sets free is free indeed!
    <br>I want to advise the whole world, especially young people,
    <br>suffering with this kind of pain or sickness that has confined them to a wheelchair.
    <br>They should be patient and wait for God's time.
    <br>I never knew I would walk again as medical people had told me I would not walk again.
    <br>I want to advise them to be patient and trust in God.
    <br>One day, He will surely answer them.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Indeed, God is with us. Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>Wonderful advice: Be patient and wait for God's time.
    <br>Once again, we rejoice with you, madam, for the wonderful healing
    <br>that has taken place in your life
    <br>and we know that as you continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>that this healing will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
