  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever medium you are using to watch this service, I say, stay blessed.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>I am taking you to the book of Ephesians 3:17.
    <br>"Then Christ will make his home in your hearts."
    <br>Christ will make his home in your what?
    <br>[Heart.]
    <br>In your heart.
    <br>This means, that is the place Christ dwells.
    <br>That is the residence.
    <br>Many times we hear the song, "Inner my heart, Lord, I want to be like Jesus, inner my heart."
    <br>In our hearts, we want to be like Jesus, not in our face.
    <br>Here it says, "Christ will make his home in your hearts".
    <br>Our heart is the communication point – a dwelling place for Christ.
    <br>A contact.
    <br>If you are to hear from Christ, it is through your heart, not your ears.
    <br>Many would say, "Jesus, what are You saying?"
    <br>You can't hear Christ through your ears but your heart.
    <br>This makes it possible for us to talk to you and at the same time, to Christ
    <br>because we are not using the same medium.
    <br>I will use my mouth to talk to you and I will use my heart to talk to Jesus.
    <br>Jesus also will talk to me and at the same time, a man can talk to me
    <br>because it’s not the same medium.
    <br>If someone is telling you, "Look, I'm praying, don't disturb me" - I question his spirituality.
    <br>You can be talking to me and at the same time, I pray to Jesus.
    <br>We are not using the same medium.
    <br>As I am talking to you now, I am talking to Jesus.
    <br>Jesus is talking to me and I am talking to you at the same time.
    <br>I am praying and at the same time, I am talking to you because I'm not using the same medium.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION
    <br>That is the topic this message.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>“… as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong."
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Christ will make your heart a dwelling place.
    <br>A dwelling place – a place of living – your heart.
    <br>Faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>Anywhere in the Bible that refers to heart, refers to the spirit.
    <br>Man’s heart and man’s spirit are the same.
    <br>Don't get confused.
    <br>Faith is of man’s heart, not of man’s body, flesh.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>The Word of God builds Christ’s nature into us.
    <br>What builds Christ's nature?
    <br>The Word of God builds Christ’s nature into us, that is building Christ's nature into individuals.
    <br>When you want to end your letter as a Christian, you say, "In Him".
    <br>When your are writing a letter to a friend or... in the end you say, "In Him".
    <br>That is; in Him I live, move, talk – do all.
    <br>The Word builds Christ’s nature into us.
    <br>In other words, God is building Himself into us, making Himself a part of us
    <br>as the Word dominates, take note of that; building Himself into us
    <br>as the Word dominates, rules and satisfies our spirit nature.
    <br>This means faith is perfected by our acting on the Word.
    <br>Faith is perfected by our what?
    <br>[Acting on the Word.]
    <br>That is?
    <br>The Word must dominate us.
    <br>The Word must live in us.
    <br>This is the secret of faith.
    <br>We say; faith is perfected by our acting - it means; Word must dominate us, live in us...
    <br>This is the secret of faith.
    <br>If the Word has not dominated you, you cannot act faith.
    <br>The Word must dominate you, live in you – this is the secret of faith.
    <br>You can easily know a man of faith by a mere looking at his attitude.
    <br>Faith is not imitation – it cannot me imitated.
    <br>When you see a man "copying" people, imitating...
    <br>Faith is not imitation – it cannot me imitated.
    <br>When you look around you say, "I like that style of a haircut. When I leave here, I am going to do the same.
    <br>Look at the suit this man wears - I am going to buy the same."
    <br>You keep comparing yourself to others; you are not content.
    <br>Faith is not imitation – it cannot by imitated.
    <br>It must arise in each person’s heart based on the Word of God because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>It must arise in each person’s heart according to the Word of God.
    <br>Because faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>When you see a man of faith, he doesn’t copy.
    <br>Follow the majority - no.
    <br>He does according to his heart.
    <br>He speaks according to his heart.
    <br>He doesn't look at the people's appearance; "this man is light in complexion - I'm going to bleach my body.
    <br>This man is slim - I'm going to do exercises to get slim.
    <br>This man has a very long hair - I'm going to tie something to my hair to get it long."
    <br>Faith does not neglect.
    <br>It does not neglect responsibilities.
    <br>Are your with me?
    <br>Faith does not neglect.
    <br>It does not neglect responsibilities.
    <br>You see a man of faith - this is a man who recognized his responsibilities.
    <br>It is easy to know the man of faith - it is simple, regardless of what they say
    <br>by mere looking at this formula you will able to know; "hey, it is not a man of faith".
    <br>Faith is not a panic button to push.
    <br>Oh, sorry, sorry, I have not fastened that button, please camera...
    <br>It is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.
    <br>Today, you see Christians coming to God when they are in trouble; running to church for healing, praying,
    <br>reading the Bible - Psalm 35, putting it under the pillow, on the stomach...
    <br>They have nightmares - they run from place to place.
    <br>But when the going is smooth - you would not see them.
    <br>Faith is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.
    <br>It is a lifestyle of trusting in God.
    <br>Faith is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.
    <br>In the time of trouble they will say, "I rebuke in the name of..."
    <br>When you see people in trouble they will go for fasting of 3-4 days because they are in trouble.
    <br>That is not a man of faith.
    <br>Faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God.
    <br>When the going is good you see them praying, fasting - they do the same when the going is hard.
    <br>Faith is not a denial – it does not deny the existence of a problem.
    <br>When you are sick, you say, "I am sick" because they know that a man can be sick and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Today, you learn that many ministers of God died suddenly - they have been sick for a long time
    <br>but they didn't want people to know that they were sick.
    <br>They were afraid that people would think the the sickness is a result of their sin.
    <br>So, they die suddenly.
    <br>Some of them commit suicide - ministers of God...
    <br>Faith is not a denial – it does not deny the existence of a problem.
    <br>We are still talking about faith.
    <br>The question - how come about faith?
    <br>Where can I get faith?
    <br>Where is the faith?
    <br>It does not originate from us.
    <br>If faith originates from saints, it would be fragile, weak.
    <br>I am talking of saints - s a i n t.
    <br>If faith originates from saints...
    <br>Not even you - you are not a saint.
    <br>Saint Apostles; if faith originates from them - it would be fragile, weak.
    <br>Faith originates from God.
    <br>This is why you must pay attention to God.
    <br>This is why you must pay attention to whom?
    <br>[God.]
    <br>What do I mean by 'pay attention to God'?
    <br>Look to God, look at God, meditate on God – you will have faith.
    <br>The more you look to God, look at God, meditate on God, the more you will have faith.
    <br>It comes spontaneously, naturally.
    <br>This is why you see many great ministers today who never attended any theology school.
    <br>This is why you see the rustic boy being raised as a great apostle today.
    <br>This is why you see a farmer or a fisherman becoming a great apostle -
    <br>without education, not being able to read a letter.
    <br>You will be surprised that he is not educated. 
    <br>How come?
    <br>How somebody not educated can manage to be a great apostle and to preach the Word? - No
    <br>If faith originates in you; no illiterate would be raised, no rustic boy or fisherman
    <br>would become a great apostle.
    <br>If faith originates in you.
    <br>You would begin to look for a professor to anoint you.
    <br>You would begin to look for personalities, rich, great famous people to anoint you.
    <br>If faith originates in you.
    <br>This is why faith does not originate in you, it originates in God.
    <br>This is the area we Christians neglect today.
    <br>As a result of this our conversion becomes questionable.
    <br>You can know if your conversion is questionable.
    <br>When you cannot act with God and know God's opinion about yourself and others,
    <br>it means your conversion is questionable.
    <br>You may know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation - yet; something is missing.
    <br>What is missing?
    <br>No.
    <br>You may have faith but not enough.
    <br>The father of the demon-possessed boy came to Jesus saying, "I have brought my son to Your disciples,
    <br>they could not have delivered him because they had no power".
    <br>Jesus said, "No. They had power. Their faith was not adequate to release that power they needed."
    <br>Faith is a Heavenly currency.
    <br>The little currency you have is the little Heavenly material you can buy -
    <br>the little resources you can obtain.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Faith is a Heavenly currency."
    <br>[Faith is a Heavenly currency.]
    <br>You go to a market, you cannot purchase more than your money.
    <br>Your responsibility should not be greater than your spiritual life.
    <br>Today, our responsibility seems to be much more than our spiritual life.
    <br>Therefore, whatever blessing you receive, is like dropping a stone in the ocean.
    <br>If I'm talking to you.
    <br>Your responsibility seems to be much greater than your spiritual life.
    <br>Whatever blessing you now receive is like dropping a needle in the ocean.
    <br>When you receive a big blessing; by the time you get home you realize that it is not enough.
    <br>OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION
    <br>My success depends on my meditation and confession.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If you have been mediating before prayer, you will get to God.
    <br>You know I said it from the beginning, faith is not a panic button to push – only in time of trouble, you pray.
    <br>Only in times of trouble, you seek the face of God.
    <br>Only in times of trouble, you fast and pray.
    <br>Only in times of trouble, you begin to run helter skelter.
    <br>That is not faith.
    <br>Faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God.
    <br>How can you trust in God without mediation?
    <br>This is why I gave you faith-bracelets.
    <br>If you want to get it as a Christian - now meditation starts.
    <br>In your office, "Take more of me, oh God; give me more of You."
    <br>If you use it for one month - you don't need it.
    <br>It will become a habit to your heart to say, "Take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>While you are talking to your boss, your heart would be saying, "take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>While you are inside the bus, "take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>While you are sitting down, your heart is supposed to be saying that, "take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>If you are not saying it, and you are only looking at me; this means that this message will not get you
    <br>anywhere in your life.
    <br>You only hear it and you get it out of your head.
    <br>This is why you cannot make use of the message.
    <br>As you are looking at me now, your heart should be busy saying, "take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>Oh Lord - give me more of You...
    <br>As you listen to me, continue to meditate on that.
    <br>Let that become your habit.
    <br>That is what you mean by a lifestyle of trusting in God.
    <br>It is not a prayer.
    <br>You pray only in time of trouble.
    <br>As you are looking at me, begin to engage your heart, "take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>That is the best language to use for now.
    <br>Don't go too far.
    <br>I said to you at the beginning; the Word builds Christ's nature in us.
    <br>The Word builds what?
    <br>[Christ nature.]
    <br>Christ possesses a nature that makes it easy for me and you to trust in Him.
    <br>What is His nature?
    <br>His nature – faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, humility, purity -
    <br>the fruits of the Spirit are the nature of Christ.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>That is the nature of Christ is what you demand for.
    <br>More of Your faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, purity - because you are more of yourself.
    <br>More of yourself is unfaithfulness, disobedience, impurity.
    <br>More of yourself is disobedience.
    <br>More of yourself is opposite of the fruits of the Spirit.
    <br>You want Him to take more of you and give you more of Him.
    <br>Right now, I hope your heart is engaging in that.
    <br>Let me see if your heart is engaging that.
    <br>Right now it is a task.
    <br>When you leave here, when you will be eating, you will be in the restroom, nothing should stop your heart
    <br>from meditating on this.
    <br>While you are talking... - and I told you we are not using the same medium.
    <br>When you are talking, you are talking with your mouth to a man, and with your heart to God.
    <br>It is not the same medium.
    <br>You can do both at the same time.
    <br>Please, let me see your hand.
    <br>Your heart, right now, is engaging that.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You.
    <br>When you say, "Take more of me, give me more of You" that is -
    <br>more of God is faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, purity,
    <br>obedience, humility – these are the nature of God.
    <br>This makes it possible for you to have faith.
    <br>This makes it possible for you to increase your faith.
    <br>You can increase your faith; you can have faith.
    <br>We have faith when we have more of the fruits of the Spirit – more of God.
    <br>The more your meditation, the more you have faith.
    <br>Please, let me see your hand.
    <br>So, you think that if you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation that you have faith - no.
    <br>There is nothing bad about it - it is good to read the Bible.
    <br>Faith originates from God.
    <br>If faith originates from God, you must acknowledge His faithfulness and trustworthiness.
    <br>Acknowledging is by meditation in your heart.
    <br>Right now, let me see your hand if your heart is engaged in this now.
    <br>We want to stand up and promise that nothing will stop me,
    <br>nothing will break my heart, nothing will stop my heart from meditating.
    <br>Nothing; when I'm in the bedroom, when I'm eating, when I'm talking to my colleague...
    <br>Even you pastors, when you minister...
    <br>As I minister to you, my heart is yearning for this, my heart is communicating this, my heart is talking this.
    <br>My heart is saying something.
    <br>Take more of me...
    <br>Let me see your hand if your heart is meditating now.
    <br>Let's rise up and make a promise.
    <br>Everyday I talk about this.
    <br>You don't know how serious it is.
    <br>I don't know how you can grow; you can never, it is not possible.
    <br>Reading the Bible from Genesis to Revelation every week - that cannot make you grow.
    <br>You need God.
    <br>Viewers, anywhere you are, whatever medium you are using to view us right now,
    <br>I want you to join us in this promise before God.
    <br>The Lord says, "I will make your heart a dwelling place. I will make your heart My home".
    <br>How can God make our heart home when we are not inviting God into our heart?
    <br>This is an invitation to God.
    <br>Out of abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
    <br>Out of abundance of what?
    <br>[Heart.]
    <br>Some of you will say, "Out of abundance of the stomach".
    <br>What is in your stomach?
    <br>Rice.
    <br>Out of abundance of your stomach the restroom takes.
    <br>Out of abundance of what?
    <br>Say "Heart!"
    <br>[Heart.]
    <br>This is the language for Christians.
    <br>Not for others; others will say, "Out of abundance of the stomach."
    <br>It is not from our stomach.
    <br>Out of abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
    <br>When you are pregnant of God, you speak of God.
    <br>Viewers at home, nothing should stop you or break you from meditation.
    <br>OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION
    <br>That is the topic of this message.
    <br>OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR MEDITATION AND CONFESSION]
    <br>But you believe our success depends on our prayer - the number of prayers you pray.
    <br>Which kind of prayer is that when you are not living the life of God and you are praying?
    <br>A break in faith is a break in God.
    <br>When you break in faith, you break in God.
    <br>Already, you have broken that relationship and you are now calling and inviting God to rescue you.
    <br>No - you must flow with God before you can pray.
    <br>Meditation makes you to flow with God.
    <br>A break in faith is a break in God.
    <br>In order not to break in faith, we must invite the nature of God.
    <br>Now - there should be no break.
    <br>Rise up your hand and make this promise - "Take more of me..." - speak it loud, before we register in our heart.
    <br>Oh Lord, take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>More of Your faithfulness, honesty, obedience, purity, kindness, goodness, and self-control.
    <br>Oh Lord, take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>More of You...
    <br>This is what your heart should be yearning for all the time, should be speaking all the time.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You.
    <br>Because you are more of yourself, that is why you misbehave.
    <br>That is why we cannot control ourselves.
    <br>What we are not willing to do is what we find ourselves doing.
    <br>"I will not do this again" but you still go back and do it.
    <br>You have made a promise – "Take more of me; give me more of You".
    <br>Your lips should not move.
    <br>When your heart is talking, nobody would know it.
    <br>When your lips are moving, it shows that you are talking.
    <br>It is your heart that is talking this time.
    <br>There should be no break.
    <br>When you are about to sleep... yes - you are going on the wonderful journey.
    <br>You say this before going sleep - what a wonderful dream.
    <br>This is why you don't understand your dream; you have broken the relationship before you pray.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You have broken the relationship before you pray".
    <br>Whom are you praying with?
    <br>You have broken the relationship before you sleep.
    <br>Who will guide you?
    <br>Which is true of you?
    <br>Before now, you were just coming to the altar wanting to pray.
    <br>You have broken the relationship; now you are starting to pray...
    <br>You want to sleep; you have broken the relationship before sleeping.
    <br>This relationship should not be what?
    <br>[Broken.]
    <br>Should not be broken.
    <br>This is when you can carry God along.
    <br>This is like you have asked me to leave you and I left you.
    <br>Later, when you have a problem and you start to call me.
    <br>You start to call, "T.B. Joshua, please help".
    <br>You know that you have asked me to leave you.
    <br>That is the case of God.
    <br>A break in faith is a break in God.
    <br>Now, in order not to have that break again – meditation.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Meditation in the Word of God is a visit with God.
    <br>When you continue to meditate, "Take more of me; give me more of You", you have visited God.
    <br>Before you know it, you begin to see revelation.
    <br>Before you know it, you dream a dream.
    <br>The promise of God will now come to your life.
    <br>You don’t need money to have peace.
    <br>You just need a revelation and relationship with God.
    <br>When God asks you, "Go to this place and get your money, contract, go and rest.
    <br>Today you are not going out".
    <br>OK - relax.
    <br>"Don't worry, go to this country; they will get you money. You need to rest .
    <br>You need to meet Me - go and fast for 3 days."
    <br>These are the things you need.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You need an appointment with God".
    <br>[You need an appointment with God.]
    <br>You know; it is possible to have an appointment with God.
    <br>When you are eating, you are about to finish - God would say, "Stop. Meet Me."
    <br>That is fasting.
    <br>And you have eaten the half of the food - right now meet Me.
    <br>You wash your hands, you go straight to your bedroom, you lie down and start praying.
    <br>God says I should meet Him.
    <br>Appointment with God will change the course of your life.
    <br>You don't have an appointment with God.
    <br>Tell me, how long you hear God saying, "Go and meet this man - he will give you a business".
    <br>I want to stand here as a Prophet telling you today:
    <br>"The key I have given you today is the key of success."
    <br>Don’t be too excited and forget your meditation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don’t be too excited with whatever happens on the outside and forget your mediation."
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, this is what has happened.
    <br>Suddenly you see somebody saying, "I have a contract of 3 billion dollar".
    <br>You would be overwhelmed, "How much?"
    <br>You would forget your mediation because of money.
    <br>Just because you heard of such money you forgot about the meditation.
    <br>But when this man disappoints you, you will remember your mediation.
    <br>If I'm talking to you.
    <br>When you are disappointed you will do what?
    <br>You will remember your meditation.
    <br>That man says now, "I am sorry. I will not be able to do it".
    <br>Oh, take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>If you see people rushing to pray - they have a problem.
    <br>That is not faith.
    <br>Faith is not a panic button to push only in times of trouble.
    <br>Faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>For there is no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>But to trust and obey
    <br>This would not allow you to talk too much.
    <br>You would not talk too much, when you know that you are not like others.
    <br>You think you are like others when you are not here.
    <br>Here you are not like others, outside you are not like others, in the market you are not like others,
    <br>in the political party; when you are there negotiating - don't forget you are not like others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Here, you are not like others."
    <br>[Here, you are not like others.]
    <br>Outside there, you are not like others.
    <br>[Outside there, you are not like others.]
    <br>At the bus stop, you are not like others.
    <br>[At the bus stop, you are not like others.]
    <br>In your political circle, you are not like others.
    <br>[In your political circle, you are not like others.]
    <br>In the market, you are not like others.
    <br>[In the market, you are not like others.]
    <br>In the business circle, you are not like others.
    <br>Don't forget, you are not like others!
    <br>[Don't forget, you are not like others.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not like others, you have forgotten yourself.
    <br>Only when you are in church, you believe you are not like others.
    <br>Immediately you leave here, you forget what you stand for.
    <br>You have forgotten.
    <br>This is why you return to your past life.
    <br>This is why you return to your past glory.
    <br>You always return to your past glory.
    <br>If I have been returned to the past glory you would not come here today.
    <br>When you leave here, you forget yourself.
    <br>You are not like others.
    <br>Even inside the plane... at the airport, when you are sitting down, remember - you are not like others.
    <br>Your meditation - tell your neighbour, "You are not like others - your meditation".
    <br>It is your meditation that makes you different.
    <br>When you meditate with your heart, you will not have time to talk anyhow.
    <br>You will not give yourself to anything out there.
    <br>When you are at the airport to connect your flight, and it is delayed, you say, "Thank You, Jesus -
    <br>an opportunity to meditate".
    <br>But you - you say, "Oh my God. God will punish them."
    <br>Whom God will punish?
    <br>When your flight is delayed, it is an opportunity to meditate.
    <br>When you are inside the aircraft - "Wow, an opportunity to meditate".
    <br>You are not like others.
    <br>You only believe in prayer because the Bible says, "Prayer is the key".
    <br>Sing down there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why can't you open that door?
    <br>Prayer is the key.
    <br>You fail to do what you need to do before the prayer.
    <br>The processing - there is a processing before the prayer.
    <br>You want to make a soup; you need so many ingredients to put together.
    <br>You need water, you need salt...
    <br>If any of these things misses it will give a different taste.
    <br>The soup will have a different taste.
    <br>The processing you need to pass through before prayer - you fail to pass through it.
    <br>Come brother.
    <br>This is God.
    <br>You have to get to God before you can call Him.
    <br>You can't stand here and say, "God!"
    <br>That is not a nature of God.
    <br>You need to meditate to get to God.
    <br>It is the meditation that will get you to God.
    <br>Now, it is time to pray.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Wait there.
    <br>The nature of God does not permit us to shout from here, "God! I need a biscuit, I need food!" - No.
    <br>It is wrong.
    <br>This is what you are doing.
    <br>Because from here to God there are so many obstacles, that will stop your voice from reaching God.
    <br>If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>From here to God there is so many obstacles; your unfaithfulness, unkindness, disobedience,
    <br>demon in your house, all sorts of things.
    <br>They are there to block your voice from reaching God.
    <br>Now, you have a role to play.
    <br>It is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to you.
    <br>You have a role to play and God has a role to play.
    <br>God is to hear you when you get to Him.
    <br>To get to Him, it is by meditation.
    <br>Meditation in the Word is a visit to God.
    <br>I'm going to visit God now.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>It will help me to overcome these obstacles.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>If you get to God, you will know.
    <br>Your spirit will tell you that you are getting to God.
    <br>You'll hear voices in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The closer you get to God the more you begin to sense the presence of holiness.
    <br>You will sense it immediately as you get closer to Him.
    <br>Now I'm here - I sense it: a visit with God.
    <br>Now, what do I need to do?
    <br>Lord, thank You for your grace, mercy...
    <br>He will tell you what to pray for.
    <br>Not you, dictating Him, but He will tell you what to ask for.
    <br>You should not ask; He will tell you what to demand for.
    <br>You should not demand.
    <br>Here.
    <br>This is the meaning of mediation.
    <br>When you get here, revelation will come.
    <br>Who gives revelation?
    <br>God!
    <br>Revelation does not come from us, human origin or senses but from God, just like faith we are talking about.
    <br>Now, you sense that revelation.
    <br>What is a revelation?
    <br>Revelation means He will tell you what to ask for, what to demand for, how to pray, when to pray -
    <br>that is revelation.
    <br>You may not be able to maintain this all days.
    <br>You are here already and you are supposed to stay here, and continue to be with God.
    <br>Because of the wall you find yourself against...
    <br>You go to work, you are working under, ... environment is not conducive - you go back.
    <br>That is why you should meditate all the time.
    <br>A break in meditation - you cannot get to God.
    <br>Please, don't be too excited and overwhelmed with what is on the outside and forget you meditation.
    <br>If you don't meditate, you cannot get revelation.
    <br>If you don’t have revelation, what are you praying for?
    <br>We don't know how to pray; the Holy Spirit teaches us.
    <br>Do you know that prayer has its own language?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, you have to bow down your head and say, "I will not break this relationship".
    <br>I will not break my meditation.
    <br>Nothing will be too exciting on the outside to make me break my meditation.
    <br>You have been given the anointed word: "Take more of me; give me more of You."
    <br>This is the anointed word given to you.
    <br>Right now, make this promise.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This makes you different from others.
    <br>When you are out there, you are not like others.
    <br>Others live life of the outside - what they see on the outside dictates their direction;
    <br>what you see on the inside dictates your direction.
    <br>What they see on the outside dictates their direction.
    <br>But you – you are not like others.
    <br>This is why you have to invite God into your heart.
    <br>God says, "I want to make your heart My home".
    <br>Right now begin to speak the word: Take more of me; give me more of You in your heart.
    <br>Believe it and He will bring it to pass.
    <br>Right now.
    <br>Begin to meditate this word in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Meditate this word and believe it; He will bring it to pass.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Don't be too excited and forget your meditation.
    <br>Continue and this will become a lifestyle of trusting God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A lifestyle of trusting God".
    <br>A lifestyle of trusting in God - I cannot hear you.
    <br>[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[A lifestyle of trusting in God.]
    <br>Don't be afraid that you don't meditate while you are talking - no.
    <br>You can be saying it and at the same time the meditation continues.
    <br>The message you have received will come in your meditation.
    <br>Meditation will allow you to remember all you have seen and happened around you.
    <br>By meditation, you will have revelation about your friends -
    <br>there are many friends you have but they are not friends.
    <br>There are many companions you have but they are not.
    <br>People around you are so many – you need to know whom they are, what they stand for.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
