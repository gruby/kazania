  <p>    
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say "Emmanuel".
    <br>Greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel"!
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>You are all welcome once again, in Jesus' name to the presence of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, what a God we have to worship!
    <br>What a Son we have to praise!
    <br>What a future lies before us!"
    <br>You may have your seats in Jesus' name.
    <br>My name is Chris and I have the wonderful privilege to share with you the Word of God today,
    <br>which I believe will strengthen your faith.
    <br>I pray that this Word will penetrate deep into your hearts, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>At the beginning of this message I made a very simple statement - I said:
    <br>What a God we have to worship!
    <br>I think you would agree with me that we serve an awesome God.
    <br>We serve a great God.
    <br>We serve a good God.
    <br>We serve a faithful God.
    <br>In fact, there are no human words that we can really use to describe how awesome and great God is.
    <br>I just want to mention a few of the qualities that make God who He is;
    <br>the God that we are here for today, that we worship, the we reverence, that we adore.
    <br>Firstly, God is eternal – as the Bible says in Psalm 90:2.
    <br>God is eternal – He is everlasting.
    <br>Secondly, God is omniscient – that means He is all-knowing, as 1 John 3:20 says.
    <br>As you are sitting down right now, as you are watching live on Emmanuel TV right now,
    <br>God knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>He knows your worries; He knows your weaknesses.
    <br>He knows your struggles; He knows your stress.
    <br>He knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>He knows your failures; He knows your faults.
    <br>He is omniscient, all-knowing.
    <br>Before you even pray, He knows your petition.
    <br>Before you ask a question, He already knows the answer – He is God.
    <br>Thirdly, God is omnipotent – that is, He is all-powerful.
    <br>Genesis 18:14 asks the question, “Is there anything too hard for the Lord?”
    <br>And the answer is no.
    <br>To God’s power, nothing is impossible!
    <br>Fourthly, God is omnipresent – that is, He is everywhere present.
    <br>Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>In the North, He is there.
    <br>In the South, He is there.
    <br>In the East, He is there.
    <br>In the West, He is there.
    <br>In your heart, He is there!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>David captured this truth in Psalm 139:7.
    <br>He revealed that God surely has perfect knowledge of man and his ways
    <br>because we are under His eyes.
    <br>Everything that is created is under His influence and nothing is hidden from Him.
    <br>The things that are beyond man to discern are within His knowledge and under His control.
    <br>He is God – the cause of all things, the fountain of all perfection,
    <br>without parts or dimensions, filling the Heaven and the earth,
    <br>pervading, governing and upholding all things – that is our God!
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Our God is an awesome God!
    <br>Why I mention the qualities and attributes of God at the beginning of this message?
    <br>For this very simple reason:
    <br>in the lights of this, acknowledging who God is, I want to ask you a probing question.
    <br>Why is it that so many of us today tend to approach God as if He does not know us?
    <br>I repeat it again.
    <br>Why do so many of us approach God in prayer today as if He does not know us,
    <br>know our situation, know our challenges, know our condition?
    <br>This will lead us to the title of today's message.
    <br>HOW TO APPROACH GOD IN PRAYER
    <br>The proof text for today's message will be taken from the Book of Matthew 6:7-8.
    <br>I read.
    <br>“And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans,
    <br>for they think they will be heard because of their many words.”
    <br>Prayer is not saying words.
    <br>Idle words may entertain men but not reach God.
    <br>This is what the Scripture is saying here.
    <br>“And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans,
    <br>for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
    <br>Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.”
    <br>I have had the privilege to live in the church for many years.
    <br>Living in the church you hear different kinds of prayers that people offer.
    <br>I would suggest to you that the kind of prayer a person offers tells us a lot about the kind of person they are.
    <br>I want to mention to you today four types of prayers that I often hear,
    <br>that are the wrong approach to prayer.
    <br>Perhaps you can identify with one, two or more of them.
    <br>By God's grace this message will help you to make adjustments.
    <br>Four types of prayer that are wrong ways of approaching God in prayer.
    <br>Number one:
    <br>Petitional Prayer – prayer controlled, dictated to you by the circumstances you are facing.
    <br>Number two:
    <br>Instructional Prayer – that is when you instruct God in the way He should go.
    <br>"Do this, do that, bless this, bless that!"
    <br>Number three:
    <br>Conventional Prayer – prayer that is born of tradition and convention
    <br>rather than conviction and faith.
    <br>Number four:
    <br>Desperate Prayer – casting and binding.
    <br>"Die by fire, you enemy!"
    <br>Desperate prayer.
    <br>I'm going to look at these different types of prayer one by one.
    <br>Firstly,
    <br>Petitional Prayer – prayer that is controlled by the kind of situation or circumstance you are facing.
    <br>Yes, it is true, the Bible says in Matthew 7:7, ‘Ask and you shall receive,
    <br>seek and you shall find, knock and the door will be opened unto you’.
    <br>Yes, the Bible says that clearly.
    <br>Jeremiah 33:3 says, ‘Call unto Me and I will answer you, says the Lord’.
    <br>This is God’s invitation to pray and His promise to answer
    <br>but the Bible is not referring to asking out of feelings.
    <br>We ask out of feelings when the happenings around us dictate the direction of our prayer.
    <br>When there is trouble, we pray against that trouble.
    <br>If the goings are good, our prayer is of thanksgiving.
    <br>When the goings are tough, our prayer becomes directed against that.
    <br>If there is poverty today, we direct our prayer against it.
    <br>If there is war around us today, we direct our prayer against it.
    <br>The situation and circumstance around us dictate the direction of our prayer.
    <br>This is petitional prayer.
    <br>Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>A lot of people see this prayer as an avenue to list their complains to God.
    <br>If you listen to the kind of prayers people offer, when you have the opportunity to hear people pray,
    <br>you see them begin to list a long list of problems, "God, please heal me, I have diabetes,
    <br>my father had diabetes, my grandfather had diabetes, my great-great grandfather had diabetes,
    <br>my forefathers had diabetes".
    <br>You begin to list out all problems to God, as if He does not know your problem.
    <br>God - the owner of your body, future, life.
    <br>When you begin to tell God, "I'm sick; heal me. I'm poor; bless me",
    <br>you are indirectly saying that He doesn't know your challenge.
    <br>Let me try to be practical here.
    <br>If I approach this gentleman... - just stand up, sir.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>If I approach this gentleman and I say to this gentleman,
    <br>"Sir, you are wearing a black suit and a red tie", what would you say?
    <br>Thank God for that.
    <br>He thanks God for that.
    <br>Of course, he is wearing a black suit and a red tie!
    <br>He is the one that got dressed this morning.
    <br>He is the one that put on this suit and put on this tie and put on these shoes,
    <br>but you are telling him as if he does not know what he himself is wearing.
    <br>This is an embarrassment.
    <br>Can you see what we do each time we come to God and tell Him, lament, complain about our problems,
    <br>as if God does not know we are facing that problem?
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Let God know you know He knows you."
    <br>You may have your seat, sir.
    <br>I don't know if you follow this example.
    <br>Maybe you can relate.
    <br>When it is time for prayer, you see people list out whole truckloads of problems.
    <br>They use the time of prayer as an opportunity to mention every situation they are facing,
    <br>whereas God knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>The Scripture we just read says before you even pray, He knows your need.
    <br>This is petitional prayer.
    <br>The wrong approach to prayer produces the wrong results.
    <br>Frustration, disappointment.
    <br>"I have been a member of this church for so many years - why am I facing this?"
    <br>Comparing yourself with others - this is the result of the wrong approach to prayer.
    <br>Secondly; let's move on to the next one.
    <br>Secondly, instructional prayer.
    <br>Very often, our attitude in prayer is to instruct God in the way He should go
    <br>when we are facing unpleasant situations
    <br>without finding out whether what we are going through is meant to glorify His name.
    <br>Because you have dropped your offering, this, that, you say, "I have a right to receive this from God".
    <br>You feel as if you are bargaining with God.
    <br>"God, I have come to this church, I have paid my offering, I'm a faithful member of this church,
    <br>You must give me that contract by next week, or else..."
    <br>You are instructing God in the way He should go, rather than seeking His opinion, His will.
    <br>People of God, our lives are in God’s hands.
    <br>We cannot control Him; rather, He is the One to control us.
    <br>We cannot instruct Him; rather, He is the One to instruct us.
    <br>We cannot direct Him; rather, He is the One to direct us.
    <br>But listen to the prayers of people today; you see people commanding and demanding from God.
    <br>Instructional prayer.
    <br>Let me share a very quick story to backup this point.
    <br>A few years ago, after the service, the evangelists were handing out the anointing sticker to people.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, given the grace - everyone in the church should receive anointing sticker.
    <br>I was handing out the anointing sticker.
    <br>I got to one momma, elderly woman; I gave her the sticker.
    <br>She looked at me and said, "No, I don't want it".
    <br>"You don't want the anointing sticker?"
    <br>I looked twice, I wanted to be sure that momma knew what I was giving to her.
    <br>She said, "No, I don't need them".
    <br>I was shocked because most people would ask for two or three or even more.
    <br>I said, "Why?"
    <br>She said, "I collected that thing last year, I put it on my shop - it doesn't work".
    <br>As you can imagine, hearing this kind of...
    <br>I felt I should take it upon myself to counsel momma, to advise and encourage her.
    <br>I told momma, "Look, if you put it the first time, and you didn't see the result,
    <br>that does not mean God is not working.
    <br>God is working in your life, you just have to continue to be faithful to Him.
    <br>Take this new sticker and put it there.
    <br>I guarantee you will come back with the testimony."
    <br>Finally, momma received the sticker.
    <br>As I was about to go, something just struck my heart.
    <br>I said, "Let me ask momma what she is selling in that shop".
    <br>I came back and said, "Momma, in the shop you put sticker on - what are you selling there?"
    <br>She looked at me and said, "I cannot lie in the house of God. I sell there ogogoro."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank God; as I've been in Nigeria for several years I understand what that is.
    <br>For those who do not know; that's referring to a local type of very strong alcohol.
    <br>Momma wanted the anointing sticker to bless her sales of alcohol.
    <br>She was wondering why the anointing sticker did not produce a positive result in her business,
    <br>whereas what she is doing in that business is not in line with God.
    <br>You may laugh but many of us take similar actions.
    <br>We try to instruct God in the way He should go.
    <br>We want God to follow our own tune, to follow our own path, to do what is in our mind to do,
    <br>without confirming if it is His will and ensuring that our life lines up with His Word.
    <br>If you just receive these anointed materials here at the Synagogue,
    <br>and take them home and feel that just putting them or using them or praying with them
    <br>suddenly result will come...
    <br>You should remember, they must be followed by a thorough reformation of heart and life.
    <br>The anointing sticker, the morning water, will not work by itself or on its own, we have to make it work.
    <br>Instructional prayer.
    <br>This ties with the next one - conventional prayer.
    <br>"In Jesus' name" - that's what we have been taught since we were small.
    <br>When the pastor says, “In Jesus’ name,” you respond, “Amen”.
    <br>When the pastor says, “Rise up for prayer,” you rise up whether you believe or not.
    <br>Many prayers today have become just a formality of religion; reality has disappeared.
    <br>We are just praying because our fathers and our grandfathers taught us to pray.
    <br>We have a book that says, "Offer this prayer. Pray in this way. Face this direction when you pray" -
    <br>conventional prayer.
    <br>Let me give you another example of this.
    <br>Many people today have come to church praying for God’s approval
    <br>on a plan they have already concluded.
    <br>They have already made up their mind - they are going this direction,
    <br>but they want God to just crown their efforts with success,
    <br>without knowing if it is God's will for them to take such a step.
    <br>Let me tell you another story.
    <br>I met a young man a couple of years ago.
    <br>He came to the church, he met me and said, "Brother, I want to know God's opinion about my marriage.
    <br>I want to get married."
    <br>I said, "This is wonderful. This is the right thing to do.
    <br>A young man - he wants to know God's opinion before jumping into a marriage - excellent, well done.
    <br>OK, tell me more - is the concerned lady aware?"
    <br>He said, "She is here".
    <br>The lady he wants to marry is behind him.
    <br>I looked at the lady.
    <br>"Is she aware that you have come to the church today because you want God's opinion on the marriage?"
    <br>He said, "Yes! She is aware. In fact, we are living together."
    <br>"- OK, you are living together? So, your parents...?
    <br>- Yes, I have already paid the dowry."
    <br>Now, he looks at me and said, "And the truth is brother, she is already pregnant".
    <br>So, after you have got the lady pregnant that you now want to come to the church to say,
    <br>"Is this God's opinion for my wife?"
    <br>You have already gone too far.
    <br>You have already taken the step.
    <br>You have already taken the action.
    <br>You have already gone ahead.
    <br>At the last minute you say, "Let me quickly run to God, just in case".
    <br>If a problem now arises in the future, they will say, "Ah, I went to church..."
    <br>Conventional prayer – pray for the sake of it.
    <br>We put “Amen” at the end of our prayers like it is a full stop at the end of a sentence,
    <br>not because it springs from our heart.
    <br>Let me tell you one vital truth today, brethren.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, and I quote,
    <br>“I cannot help anyone who does not accept Scriptural solution”.
    <br>If what you are here for today is not sanctioned by Scripture,
    <br>no amount of prayers and tears and fasting can release it.
    <br>No amount of prayer in tongues...
    <br>No amount of that can release what you are here for, if it is not sanctioned by Scripture,
    <br>if you are not in line with God.
    <br>This is conventional prayer and the result of this is frustration, disappointment, disillusionment,
    <br>complaining, grumbling, comparing yourself, inferiority complex.
    <br>This is the result of the wrong kind of prayer.
    <br>That's why we received a message just two weeks ago, where Prophet T.B. Joshua said,
    <br>“Filling your prayer with Scripture helps to ensure that your prayer lines up
    <br>with God’s Word and intention for your life”.
    <br>Let's quickly go to the next one - desperate prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Desperate prayer".
    <br>You know this kind of prayer - casting and binding.
    <br>"My enemy, wherever he is right now - die by fire!
    <br>Whichever, whatever... - die by fire!"
    <br>The Bible says that God will prepare a table for you in the presence of your enemies.
    <br>If they die by fire who will witness the glory of God in your life on the table?
    <br>I ask this question, if Prophet T.B. Joshua offered that kind of prayer, how many people would be here today?
    <br>If we are sincere with ourselves, many of us in the past have bound and loosed Prophet T.B Joshua in prayer.
    <br>We bind him, then we loose him again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God is not interested in the death of a sinner but that he should come to repentance.
    <br>We are not fighting flesh and blood.
    <br>You are fighting your neighbour, mother in law, father in law, they are the cause of my problem,
    <br>they are witches, they are this - God should strike them down.
    <br>You are fighting the wrong kind of battle.
    <br>This is a very simple example.
    <br>See this door.
    <br>I hope camera can see this door.
    <br>Let me show you what you do anytime you are praying against your enemies.
    <br>Here you are praying against your enemies, "God should destroy them, finish them, wherever they are.
    <br>I curse them right now!"
    <br>The door that your enemies are using to attack you is open.
    <br>Satan rules through sin; your enemy can only attack you through sin.
    <br>You are busy praying against your enemy but the route that he is going to use to inflict you,
    <br>you have opened it.
    <br>Do you understand?
    <br>You are busy praying, trying to strike the root of that problem - the door is open!
    <br>What do you need to do?
    <br>Close the door.
    <br>How do we close the door?
    <br>Stop praying against your enemies and start praying against your weakness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your weakness is the route, the avenue, that satan uses to enter and hit you,
    <br>afflict you and touch you.
    <br>And you are busy saying, "Die by fire...", whereas the door is open.
    <br>You have to close the door.
    <br>What is the summary of this?
    <br>We should be more concerned about relationship than about results.
    <br>Relationship with God.
    <br>We should be more concerned about relationship with God than results.
    <br>Breakthrough, blessing, healing, deliverance - it is available for you on the table.
    <br>What should concern you now is relationship.
    <br>That Scripture I read - Matthew 6:7-9...
    <br>Verse 9 shows us how we should approach God in prayer.
    <br>We have read it and can quote it; it's the Lord's prayer.
    <br>It simply says,
    <br>"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
    <br>your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
    <br>Give us today our daily bread.
    <br>And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
    <br>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."
    <br>Every sentence of the Lord’s Prayer is a sermon in itself.
    <br>I just want to bring out two very vital points, when God Himself is instructing us how to approach Him in prayer.
    <br>Number one:
    <br>Acknowledge who God is.
    <br>‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
    <br>your kingdom come, your will be done,
    <br>for yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory and honour forever.’
    <br>Acknowledge who God is.
    <br>We pray not to pull God to our mind but to bring ourselves to His.
    <br>Acknowledge who God is.
    <br>Number two:
    <br>Acknowledge who you are before God.
    <br>‘Forgive us our sins, Lord as we forgive those who sin against us.’
    <br>Any time you approach God in prayer, picture yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are a mere shadow.
    <br>How can clay tell the potter what to do?
    <br>We are a mere shadow.
    <br>James in the Bible describes man as a beautiful flower that blossoms for a while and then withers,
    <br>a vapour that appears for a while and then disappears.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yet we approach God as if He does not know who we are;
    <br>we approach God without acknowledging who we are before Him.
    <br>In the Bible there is a wonderful example of Peter in Luke 5:8.
    <br>Peter did not dare to enter the fire of Jesus’ purity and the light of Jesus’ holiness.
    <br>He got on his knees and he said, ‘Depart from me, Lord for I am a sinful man’.
    <br>He acknowledged his position before God as a sinner in need of salvation,
    <br>not coming to demand blessing, demand healing, demand breakthrough, demand prosperity.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the same vein the centurion in Matthew 8:8; when he told Jesus about his situation,
    <br>Jesus said, "I will come with you to your house",
    <br>the centurion said, "No. I'm not deserving that you even enter under my roof - just say the Word".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This means,
    <br>no one is too rich or poor to acknowledge their weakness,
    <br>just as no one is too good or bad to qualify for God’s grace.
    <br>Today we are no longer conscious of our sin, our weakness, when we enter the presence of God.
    <br>That is why we can dare to enter His purity and holiness
    <br>and begin to demand for blessing as if it is our right, as if we deserve it.
    <br>I'm not trying to tell you, people of God, that God has not promised good and wonderful and abundant
    <br>blessings for His children.
    <br>God knows how to take care of His children.
    <br>I’m just simply telling you our approach to God matters.
    <br>Brethren, in conclusion, I want to read a very inspiring Scripture in the Book of Romans 11.
    <br>I want you to listen carefully to the words of the Scripture.
    <br>Romans 11:33-36
    <br>It reads thus,
    <br>“Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
    <br>How unsearchable His judgements, and His paths beyond tracing out!
    <br>Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counsellor?
    <br>Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?
    <br>For from Him and through Him and for Him are all things.
    <br>To Him be the glory forever! Amen.”
    <br>The duty of prayer is founded on the sufficiency of God.
    <br>In other words, God has all you need.
    <br>Therefore, let us not limit or restrict God to certain answer by just praying for specific needs.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our prayer should be of thanks,
    <br>not just for what God has done but for what He is able to do
    <br>for He is able to do more than we could ever dream.
    <br>The way out now is for you to be more concerned about your relationship with God than the results
    <br>because at God’s time, everything is beautiful.
    <br>God takes care of His good and faithful children.
    <br>But God will not release a blessing unto you
    <br>if He knows that blessing may likely lead to a temptation that will take you away from Him.
    <br>He is more interested in your eternal glory than your present comfort.
    <br>Take care of your relationship with God and Jesus will take care of the results.
    <br>May God bless His Word
    <br>in the midst of our hearts
    <br>as we are not just a hearer of the Word but a doer of the Word, in Jesus’ name.
