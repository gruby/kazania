  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, let me stretch my hand to the screen.
    <br>I want you to believe - anywhere you are, right now, it's about to happen.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Right now place your hand.
    <br>Anywhere - place it.
    <br>Chain of fibroid -  be disconnected!
    <br>Chain of fibroid,
    <br>low sperm count,
    <br>worm,
    <br>tube blockage,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Open your mouth.
    <br>SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Watch the screen and see what is happening.
    <br>More people are vomitting out.
    <br>Just continue to watch the screen and see what is happening live and direct in our midst.
    <br>SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Watch the screen.
    <br>That is another one right there.
    <br>You can see what is coming out of her body.
    <br>Watch the screen, see what is coming out!
    <br>You have three fibroids and two have come out.
    <br>It remains one and it will come out right now.
    <br>Two are out already, one is to go.
    <br>SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Watch the screen.
    <br>Something has fallen into my pants, as the man of God has said.
    <br>Thank you, I am going to the toilet.
    <br>Watch the screen.
    <br>This is happening right now, right here.
    <br>The woman vomitted what has been the tube blockage in her life.
    <br>Watch your screen right now.
    <br>That is the one that dropped in her pants.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>It has come out already, all the fibroids in her system.
    <br>Open your eyes and watch.
    <br>Stretch your hand and say, "Lord, manifest Yourself in my life". Prayer.
    <br>SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Low sperm count,
    <br>tube blockage,
    <br>worm,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>That is fibroid.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>There is a woman passing out her fibroid right there.
    <br>SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Place your hand.
    <br>Keep watching your screen.
    <br>SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Keep watching your screen.
    <br>Here I am with all I have
    <br>I raise my hands to worship You
    <br>I wanna say thank You
    <br>O thank You
    <br>For everything for who You are
    <br>You cover me and touch my heart
    <br>I wanna say thank You
    <br>O thank You
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>Begin to give thanks to God and share your testimony with your neighbour.
    <br>If you must receive, you must learn to plant.
    <br>I told you some weeks ago how to start this.
    <br>Get a carton and make a hole and cello tape it round.
    <br>Every day should be your offering.
    <br>We are not saying you should bring it to the church.
    <br>Every day.
    <br>Do not depend on your salary.
    <br>God does not know anything about your salary.
    <br>He promised to bless you every day.
    <br>If you want to be receiving blessing, mercy and favour,
    <br>every day, have this carton. Put it inside your bedroom.
    <br>As you go out and come in, put something inside this carton -
    <br>something your life depends on.
    <br>Towards the end of the week, anytime you are free,
    <br>take the money; don't count the money. Put it inside an envelope.
    <br>Take it to the fatherless, widows, physically challenged.
    <br>Everything about you is supposed to be new.
    <br>Your destiny needs to be reshaped.
    <br>Giving offers us an opportunity of reshaping our destiny.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Giving offers us an opportunity of reshaping our destiny".
    <br>When we say 'giving',
    <br>what you give does not matter, but the way and manner you give it.
    <br>Whatever you want to give must be given cheerfully.
    <br>Cheerfully.
    <br>Before you can give something cheerfully, that thing must be something
    <br>your life depends on - something you need, not something you don't need.
    <br>It's not all the time you give what you don't need.
    <br>Many times, you should give what you need also.
    <br>Something you want, you should be able to give it.
    <br>The problem we are facing is not too far.
    <br>Not that you don't give but you give what you don't need.
    <br>You should be able to give two days in a week out of seven days -
    <br>something you need.
    <br>Ah, I need this thing. I need it.
    <br>Open your warehouse, your garage. Take a new tyre, not a used tyre.
    <br>Can you imagine how many people you have killed in the past
    <br>through your offering; through your unworthy offering.
    <br>You keep giving tyres you don't need - used tyres - and
    <br>these people you're giving - they cherish it.
    <br>They would now use it for a vehicle that is going for a long distance.
    <br>Before they know it, the tyre bursts, and thousands die.
    <br>Can you imagine what your unworthy offering has done?
    <br>Out of seven days in a week, you must be able to give two days -
    <br>something your life depends on - something you need.
    <br>If not, your offering is unworthy.
    <br>I want you to make this decision.
    <br>Let me see your hand up.
    <br>Right now, decision!
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>Stretch it forward.
    <br>As you stretch your hand, you are ready to make a decision.
    <br>Don't wait till you have a box. Get a carton.
    <br>You and your husband, put the money together.
    <br>You housewife, you don't have a job or husband, whatever little you are doing.
    <br>The best time to give is when you don't have.
    <br>When you begin to have so much, you cannot give what your life depends on.
    <br>But when you have little, if you can give out of that little,
    <br>wow!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The best time to give is when you don't have".
    <br>So thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
