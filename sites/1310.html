  <p>    
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Where are your things, your property?
    <br>My husband has moved everything to the village.
    <br>Are you not surprised that I asked about your property?
    <br>I am not surprised.
    <br>My sister even sent me a text in church that she dreamt you spoke to me today.
    <br>Where is your husband now?
    <br>I don't know where he is right now.
    <br>Probably, he is in the village; we are not talking.
    <br>Are you not surprised a man is asking you where is your property.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I am seeing the property has been taken to the village - everything.
    <br>And the man is not in the village.
    <br>You too, you are now becoming a bad woman.
    <br>A condition should not make people to misbehave
    <br>Your condition is now making you to misbehave.
    <br>A situation you are supposed to get out off under one year
    <br>you may spend twenty years and still remain in that situation.
    <br>We are not supposed to stay long in our situation because it is a test.
    <br>When you are doing examination, do you stay at examination for one year?
    <br>When you enter examination hall, it's for a while.
    <br>After the test, the result comes out -  you will be promoted.
    <br>But when a situation remains for a year, two years, three years - it's not normal.
    <br>But when you don't see it as a test, you try to avoid it, do all sort of things, manipulate - satan dislodges you.
    <br>Our situation is a test, examination.
    <br>Read, sit for the exam, get it.
    <br>Put it behind you.
    <br>There was a text you husband saw one day.
    <br>I will not say what will destroy your marriage.
    <br>I will say what will bring...
    <br>because this man still loves you.
    <br>He still loves you but you believe that you are too much - you are very beautiful.
    <br>You keep looking at the mirror - your mirror keeps deceiving you.
    <br>So, I want to see you, okay.
    <br>This marriage, whatever we can do -  the man still loves you.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Listen to me. You are a stubborn woman.
    <br>I know.
    <br>You do not respect the man.
    <br>You are very stubborn; you gave the man a tough time.
    <br>He asked me to leave my banking job...
    <br>Stop that! Which banking? You are talking about the bank as if banking... Everyone there is suffering now,
    <br>about the banking and everything.
    <br>Why are you mentioning bank?
    <br>Is it special? What is special in a bank?
    <br>If she was selling okrika, she would not mention okrika.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>If she was selling fish, she would not say: "He made me to leave fish work".
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Why is it starting with the word 'banking'? That is to tell you she is a stubborn woman.
    <br>Because I'm not expecting her start to introduce herself: "He made me to leave my banking work."
    <br>Which kind of banking? Is it the general manager?
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>No. She is not supposed to start from the banking.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>"He made me to leave my banking work." What is special in a bank?
    <br>Why are you telling me you are working in the bank?
    <br>The man - I am defending the man. I don't know the man; I have never met the man.
    <br>You are the cause of this marriage...
    <br>You are the cause; very stubborn woman.
    <br>Go and wait for me. I will do every proper thing to unite this marriage.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Are you not interested?
    <br>I am interested, we have two kids together.
    <br>You mention kids again.
    <br>Please, sir.
    <br>She mentions kids again.
    <br>See me, oh...
    <br>"Are you interested in the marriage?" "I am interested." Why do you mention kids?
    <br>You have kids, you allow your own marriage to go that way.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Where does your husband work?
    <br>He is in Arbijan.
    <br>Where is he working?
    <br>He works, he stays in Arbijan, he works there, he does his business there.
    <br>Can you imagine that. She cannot tell the kind of work he is doing. But she is working in the bank.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>And the husband is working in the air.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>She is telling us that the husband has no job.
    <br>So you the one feeding your husband?
    <br>So you the one feeding your husband, you work in the bank as MD of the bank. Are you MD?
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>What are you doing in the bank?
    <br>I was a cashier there. A teller.
    <br>Is cashier a job? Go and sit down.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Please, I want to see her.
    <br>All this is to humble her, she very proud.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Rose Umeghalu. 
    <br>The man standing by my side is my father, retired Commander Llukwe,
    <br>and this is my immediate younger sister Ifeyinwa Walter Okafor,
    <br>and this is her husband, my in-law Ikechukwu Walter Okafor.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God came to me and asked me where my property was.
    <br>He also said that my husband had moved all my things to the village.
    <br>All the prophecies the man of God gave me on Sunday are true.
    <br>Because for almost a year, my husband and I have not been talking.
    <br>We had problems and we separated.
    <br>I moved my things on the 29th of December last year to my father's house.
    <br>After the prophecy, the man of God said that he wanted to see my husband,
    <br>and I know he is here.
    <br>Mrs  Rose Umeghalu & Family 
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My name is Retired Commander Emmanuel Llukwe.
    <br>Last Sunday, we were at home watching Emmanuel TV with members of my family in Anambra State.
    <br>Then, suddenly, the man of God spotted my daughter.
    <br>Everybody shouted - we were not aware that she was here.
    <br>We shouted and became interested. We heard the prophecy the man of God gave.
    <br>Everything he said is very correct.
    <br>What really happened was that about five months ago...
    <br>Why do you want to disturb baba?
    <br>Baba is out of this issue. He only came here to support the marriage. Baba, please. Don't disturb baba.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As for me, I don't know there is...
    <br>Just introduction. I don't want to hear anything because I don't want anything to affect this marriage.
    <br>This is marriage from God and we are not in law court.
    <br>It's purely divine message given by God.
    <br>So, sir, your name. Are you the one we are looking for?
    <br>My name is Chukwuma Umeghalu. I am a Nigerian from Anambra.
    <br>So you are the husband of my sister?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So you have listened to the message.
    <br>And I am very sorry that I will not allow you to talk because after service I want to see the family.
    <br>And do you have anything against what the Holy Spirit has said?
    <br>No.
    <br>Or I should allow you to talk for 2-3 minutes?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But I don't want you to say anything that will affect our marriage. Ok, let's hear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She is my wife and I still love her.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He says he still loves her. I think we can listen to you a bit.
    <br>So because nothing bad will come from love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok.
    <br>The problem started when we wanted to wed
    <br>and she needed a Hummer jeep for the wedding.
    <br>Ok, don't worry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My brother, I have said everything. I said my daughter here is very stubborn 
    <br>and when you are stubborn, you want to use private jet.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok. So thank you very much and I will not want him to talk more than that,
    <br>I want to see them immediately after the service.
    <br>I will host them, we'll pray together. Everything will be alright, ok?
    <br>This is purely message from God.
    <br>This marriage is from God. There is nothing we can do about it.
    <br>So, please, I'm sorry. So thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prophet T.B.Joshua hosted Mr and Mrs Umeghalu and family at the SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God prayed with and counselled the family.
    <br>Let us hear their story.
    <br>I want to thank God for bringing my family back together.
    <br>Before I came here, from the onset of my home, it has been war, problems,
    <br>more of tears and absence of joy, a lot of issues.
    <br>But God has done it today - He has restored peace into my family once again.
    <br>Before I came here, I didn't know I was the cause of the key problem.
    <br>It was God that revealed it.
    <br>I didn't know that it was my duty first to be submissive before any other thing.
    <br>I wanted to be always right.
    <br>Because of all these issues, last year, he asked for a divorce, that he wanted us to separate.
    <br>That was in May. So, from May 'til last year week Sunday, we were not talking.
    <br>I had to leave my matrimonial home and move my kids to my father's house.
    <br>The man of God sent for my husband.
    <br>He prayed for me and also said he was going to talk to my husband and invited him over.
    <br>Since then, peace has come into our lives once again.
    <br>We are now communicating. We don't talk much but we are talking more now.
    <br>He's telling me a lot of things and I'm telling him a lot of things.
    <br>There's communication because then, we lacked communication.
    <br>We didn't talk; we only reacted!
    <br>Those reactions were often negative?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>My name is Chukwuma Umeghalu. I am a Nigerian from Anambra State.
    <br>I thank God today and I thank the man of God T.B. Joshua for saving my family.
    <br>I'm so happy today and I thank God for everything.
    <br>Now, my family is back again. I am so glad.
    <br>I don't have much to say. I'm just thanking God for saving my family.
    <br>My wife and I are so happy now; we are living as husband and wife again.
    <br>I am so glad. I thank God for everything.
    <br>I didn't expect that I would pass through this for 13 years. But today I am happy.
    <br>I am retired Commander Emmanuel llukwe.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of God in my family. I am so excited, I am so happy.
    <br>Prior to now, we were warming up for war.
    <br>Seriously, we were preparing, I started making contacts
    <br>because about six months ago, my son-in-law called me on the phone.
    <br>I was not aware that there was any problem.
    <br>He called me on the phone and told me in a very shocking manner that he was no longer interested
    <br>in being married to my daughter, without even giving me reasons.
    <br>Outrightly, I told him that if he was not going to stay married to my daughter,
    <br>it was the court he should go to, that I would meet him there. I rested my case.
    <br>I later called my daughter to find out what was amiss.
    <br>What she told me was not cogent enough
    <br>but then, I shouldn't take sides because she was my daughter.
    <br>I dare not take a decision just from one person's point of view.
    <br>Subsequently, I received a telephone call - my in-law called me.
    <br>He normally called me on screened number.
    <br>He screened the number so that I wouldn't know the number to call him back.
    <br>I chose to maintain my cool.
    <br>At some other time, he called me. I raised those issues my daughter told me
    <br>and he didn't deny them. He made one funny allegation which he couldn't substantiate.
    <br>I called his people - I took the initiative and called his seniour brother and his cousin
    <br>to tell them what was happening.
    <br>I didn't get any response from them.
    <br>Then, I concluded that maybe it was a family decision and since I knew I was up to the task,
    <br>I had to prepare myself, call my family members and inform them of the situation.
    <br>I wasn't expecting this.
    <br>I thank God because it is not my prayers to see any of my children divorced - I don't like it.
    <br>I have been married for 40 years now
    <br>and my father was married to my mother for over 50 years before he died.
    <br>My grandfather never divorced any of his wives.
    <br>We have a tradition in our home and I want that tradition to be maintained.
    <br>I give glory to God for what has happened today.
    <br>Retired Commander Emmanuel llukwe & Family Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>About 10 days ago on Sunday we were at home watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>It's a religion in my house, we were just watching it,
    <br>when my daughter was spotted and called by man of God.
    <br>We all raised an alarm; we listened and said God had spoken.
    <br>Since God had spotted my daughter, that meant God had something to say in this marriage
    <br>So, all our anger, pain, disappointment - we had doubt at the moment
    <br>but I knew God had something to say.
    <br>That goes to confirm that where there is no prophecy, people perish.
    <br>From that moment, it was joy. I am thanking God.
    <br>I'm thanking the man of God because this is a miracle that just happened.
    <br>I appreciate God and return the glory to God.
    <br>It is my prayer that God sustain the man of God, give him more anointing
    <br>so that other people would benefit  from this kind of anointing.
    <br>It is amazing what I have seen. When I looked at them, it was as if nothing had happened before.
    <br>For this, I give the glory to God.
    <br>I would say that if you miss God, you miss everything.
    <br>Whatever problem you have, call upon God; He will answer you
    <br>because He said you should cast your burdens on Him.
    <br>All this while, we had been praying and God has answered.
    <br>If you have a problem, call upon God; He will surely answer you.
    <br>Children of God - Emmanuel! ( God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Ifeyinwa Okafor.
    <br>I am so happy to be here at the SCOAN.
    <br>I just want to bless the name of the Lord for this great day,
    <br>for what He has done for my family.
    <br>Indeed, it has been marvelous.
    <br>I thank God for directing our steps to the SCOAN. God is indeed working here.
    <br>Three weeks ago, I was at home sleeping
    <br>and I had a dream where the man of God came to my home in Delta State.
    <br>He came to my sitting room and stood in front of my TV,
    <br>He stretched forth his hands towards my elder sister Mrs Rose Umheghalu,
    <br>laid his hands on her and she fell under the anointing.
    <br>I was watching her and he turned to my direction and laid his hands on me
    <br>and fell down and I felt this sensation of an electric shock all over my body.
    <br>I stood up in that dream and said," This is the deliverance I have been watching
    <br>on Emmanuel TV. So, this is what it feels like!"
    <br>Immediately I said that I woke up. It was almost 2am.
    <br>I said, "Indeed, the Lord has visited my home."
    <br>In the morning, I called my husband and my elder sister who happened to be staying with me
    <br>since the crisis started and I narrated my dream to her.
    <br>We thank God for the deliverance.
    <br>About a week later, she told me that she wanted to come down to Lagos to seek the face of God
    <br>concerning the marital crisis she has been having in her home.
    <br>Then she came.
    <br>She travelled on Saturday. We waited at home;
    <br>we didn't go for our regular church services just so we could watch the Live SCOAN service
    <br>because we knew my sister was there.
    <br>And we knew He will meet the case and also wanted to pray with her.
    <br>And we were at home.
    <br>I woke up a bit late, about 8:30 am and realised the service had started,
    <br>and I noticed one funny thing -
    <br>I had another dream where I saw the man of God speaking to my sister.
    <br>I was so happy because I had heard testimonies that when the man of God speaks to you,
    <br>it is a breakthrough already.
    <br>Immediately I picked up my phone to call her, it was ringing.
    <br>I checked my TV and saw that the praise and worship had started.
    <br>I knew that she would not be able to answer the call anymore,
    <br>so I sent her a text that said, "My sister, all is well with you;
    <br>I saw when the man of God spoke to you."
    <br>To my amazement, after the sermon, when the man of God was speaking and prophesying to people,
    <br>he went to my sister. He went straight to the point; he did not mince his words.
    <br>He asked: "Where is your property?"
    <br>And that time, my sister did not even know where her property was.
    <br>Her husband had moved; she had not seen her husband for a year.
    <br>The husband moved her properties to the village.
    <br>They had not spoken. There was crisis everywhere.
    <br>She had been seeking the face of God to know whether this marriage would work or not.
    <br>The Lord located her and I knew the dream and the deliverance had come to pass.
    <br>That is why we all came to celebrate and since we came, it has been wonderful!
    <br>Emmanuel! ( God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I have never seen my sister happier. It is as if they got married yesterday.
    <br>Since the deliverance, they have been inseparable; they have been together,
    <br>moving together, eating together, staying together.
    <br>I just want to thank God for this mighty deliverance that has come to her,
    <br>to myself, to my husband, to my home. There is so much peace.
    <br>It looks as if you can even see the peace physically.
    <br>God indeed has done great things in my family and I return all the glory to Him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>My advice to people that are having this kind of problem, all over the world - seek the face of God.
    <br>Genuinely seek the face of God; He is a God that answers prayers.
    <br>He will locate you. Just seek the face of God and He will locate that problem
    <br>and will solve the problem because God answers prayers. Amen.
    <br>Wow! I am so happy. I am happy to be part of this reconciliation.
    <br>Indeed, it is worth being here.
    <br>Truly, I have always longed to be part of the SCOAN.
    <br>When all these things started happening, I saw it. My wife rushed into the room that morning
    <br>to tell me that the man of God had spotted the elder sister amongst millions of people
    <br>in this big SCOAN. I rushed in immediately and saw the man of God talking to Rose.
    <br>What was going through my mind was that God indeed is God.
    <br>This revelation came before now, just like what my wife has said.
    <br>We immediately concluded that no matter what happens,
    <br>we are going to be part of this reconciliation.
    <br>We are happy that God has done it and He has done it for us all.
    <br>My word of advice, like the man of God said - he is always talking about love -
    <br>love is the greatest thing in life.
    <br>With love, I believe that most marriages having challenges today
    <br>will be able to condone themselves and will be able to bear a lot of issues.
    <br>No man is perfect; no woman is perfect.
    <br>Let us all key into the words of man of God.
    <br>His key words are love and faith
    <br>because these are the things that are going to propel us beyond every obstacle of life.
    <br>I thank God that love has come back to it's real self and today, we are all happy to be here.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The word of advice I would give to people is to have patience
    <br>because sometimes God has many ways to prove Himself.
    <br>I thank God today for my family and for my wife. I love her so much.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world who have a problem like this -
    <br>I would say, keep trusting in God.
    <br>Just keep trusting because one day, God will have something to say about any situation in your life.
    <br>Don't be in a hurry.
    <br>Don't be in a haste because when you are in a haste
    <br>you might make a very drastic mistake in your life.
    <br>Just keep trusting and ask God because, like what the man of God normally says,
    <br>if God does not release you, you have no right to release yourself,
    <br>if not, you will make another mistake. You will keep making more and more mistakes.
    <br>Just keep holding on, trust in God, be patient and one day He will address the issue in your life.
    <br>And the man of God here is also blessing this family with a cash sum of 200,000 Naira
    <br>to facilitate your transport back to where you are coming from and also
    <br>the man of God has asked us to also encourage you in faith to remain true to God,
    <br>to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and also remember, the past must not be brought to account anymore.
    <br>I want to say a big thank you to Prophet T. B. Joshua. I am very grateful.
    <br>He's been a father to me because last week, when I came here,
    <br>he gave me a sum of N50, 000 and he is still blessing me again.
    <br>From the depth of my heart, I am really happy and very grateful.
    <br>I just want to thank God for his life and I pray that God will keep him
    <br>and give him more grace in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Emmanuel! Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>Mr Umeghalu & Family Receive N200,00 From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>We thank God. Emmanuel!
    <br>I love you!
