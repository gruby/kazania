  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I say to you, be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being restored!
    <br>I can see your health being restored!
    <br>I can see your career being restored!
    <br>I can see your finances being restored!
    <br>I can see your business being restored!
    <br>Be restored!

    <br>What is the position of your health?  Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Your liver, kidneys, blood, muscles, bones, tendons -
    <br>be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua - Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Any of your organs - be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Any of your faculties - be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Dry bones shall rise again!
    <br>Come back!
    <br>Say, come back!
    <br>My life - come back!
    <br>My business - come back!
    <br>My finances - come back!
    <br>My career - come back!

    <br>Listen, your destiny can never be changed!
    <br>If something happened to your destiny and you know that something has happened,
    <br>it means that you have abandoned your destiny and followed someone else's destiny.
    <br>Viewers, resurrection is to bring back your destiny
    <br>so that you can become an authority in your calling.
    <br>Right now, this an occasion!
    <br>Bring back my destiny!
    <br>If you are destined to be a fishermanm you'll become an authority in it.
    <br>If you are destined to be a carpenter, you'll become an authority at the end of the day.
    <br>If you are destined to be a vendor, you'll become an authority.
    <br>Right now, I pray, in the name of Jesus, be restored!
    <br>Be restored, in the name of Jesus!
