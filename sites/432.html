    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Confess in the presence of God.
    <br>Remember our message today.
    <br>When a farmer gets his seed into the ground,
    <br>he does not dig it up everyday to see how it is doing
    <br>but believes it is aright and settled.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I believe my case is settled."
    <br>I can't hear you, face your neighbor.
    <br>I believe my case is settled!
    <br>I believe my business is settled!
    <br>I believe my finances are settled!
    <br>Begin to believe right now.
    <br>Believe, believe!
    <br>My case is settled!
    <br>My finances are settled!
    <br>My health is settled!
    <br>My career is settled!
    <br>I believe, in the name of Jesus, my case is settled in Heaven!
    <br>It is settled
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My business is settled in Heaven."
    <br>I believe!
    <br>You should believe your case is settled!
    <br>Believe now your finances are settled!
    <br>I believe! Begin to confess your belief, right now.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Remember our message today, it is a very vital issue for you.
    <br>When you get home sit down.
    <br>Once you place your seed into the soil and cover it,
    <br>you do not go back to check whether it is doing well.
    <br>You believe it is settled.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I believe my case is settled!
    <br>I believe my finances are settled!
    <br>I believe my health is settled!
    <br>It is well with my soul!
    <br>It is well with my body!
    <br>It is well with my finances!
    <br>My business - it is well! It is a new dawn!
    <br>I say, "Good Morning" to you, my finances!
    <br>I say, "Good Morning" to you, my health!
    <br>I say, "Good Morning" to you, my finances!
    <br>It is done!
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>If you believe this message of a farmer,
    <br>that once they put their seed in the soil, they don't go back there
    <br>to dig it up and see how it is doing.
    <br>In the same vein, if they could believe in nature,
    <br>why not believe in the God of nature?
    <br>Why not believe in imperishable Seed?
    <br>The Word of God says it is well!
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Can you hear what the Word of God says?
    <br>If the farmer says it is well with the seed they buried in the soil,
    <br>they never go there to dig up to see how it is doing
    <br>but they say, it is settled!
    <br>Say, "My case is settled!"
    <br>Do you hear what the Word of God says?
    <br>The Word of God says, "Let the weak say, 'I am strong'.
    <br>Let the poor say, 'I am blessed'.
    <br>Let the sick say, 'I am healed'." Confess!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I want to send a signal to your spirit.
    <br>The message today is very powerful.
    <br>It really revives everyone.
    <br>I want to remind you.
    <br>Everyone of us was once a farmer; 90% of us.
    <br>Even if you go back to the village now, your father is a farmer.
    <br>If you go back to the village for 3 days, you will likely go to the farm for 1 day.
    <br>If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>If you go to the village as a visitor for 5 days,
    <br>you will likely go to farm for 2 days out of those 5 days.
    <br>You want to go and see where you grew up.
    <br>Those days when you were very small, you were setting traps to catch...
    <br>You still want to go and see it.
    <br>We are all farmers.
    <br>Back, to help your faith. 
    <br>In those days - remember...
    <br>When you put your seed into the ground or soil and buried it,
    <br>you did not go back there again to see how it was doing.
    <br>You said, "it is well!"
    <br>Until today, that is the principle of farmers.
    <br>If they could believe so much in nature,
    <br>why don't you believe in the imperishable Seed, the Word of God?
    <br>The Word of God says, "Let the weak say, 'I am strong'.
    <br>Let the sick say, 'I am healed!'.
    <br>Let the poor say, 'I am blessed'.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>'I am blessed'.
    <br>Let the prisoner say, 'I am free!'."
    <br>Confess it right now!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You don't need to wait and see the prison open.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I don't need to wait to see my body healed! I am healed!
    <br>I don't need to wait to see my money being paid! My money has been paid!
    <br>Confess it right now!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You don't need to wait to see your career flourish. My career is flourishing!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer 
    <br>That should be your confession.
    <br>You don't need to wait and see your body being healed! I am healed already!
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>Faith is expecting God to do what He promised to do!
    <br>What does He promise to do?
    <br>To heal, deliver, bless and promote you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I don't need to wait to see my body being healed! I am healed!"
    <br>I don't need to wait to see my business flourish!
    <br>My business is flourishing already!
    <br>In the same vein, farmers do not wait to see their seed grow.
    <br>They believe it is growing! That is their belief,
    <br>Farmers do not wait to see their seed grow.
    <br>They believe it is growing; it is settled.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer 
    <br>The problem you are facing now is that
    <br>you are waiting to see your body being healed.
    <br>When the man of God says, "You are healed", you say, "Am I healed?"
    <br>That is where satan waits. 
    <br>This is where obstacle comes.
    <br>When you don't apply faith, you can't receive.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you don't apply faith, you cannot receive".
    <br>When the man of God says, "You are healed" - by faith, I am healed!
    <br>When a man of God talks to you by faith, you receive it by faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When a man of God speaks to you by faith, you receive it by faith."
    <br>When a man of God says, "You are healed", receive it by faith!
    <br>Faith!
    <br>The issue of farmers is applicable to everyone, to our Christian life.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>When a farmer puts his seed into the soil,
    <br>he does not go back there to see how it is doing; he says, "Thank You, Lord".
    <br>No matter the weather, condition, or season, they believe it is settled.
    <br>Forever oh Lord
    <br>Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>Forever oh Lord
    <br>Your Word is settled 
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>Forever oh Lord
    <br>Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>Forever oh Lord
    <br>Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven is is settled
    <br>That is, your case is settled!
    <br>Your business is settled!
    <br>Your finances are settled!
    <br>Someone is somewhere settling your business!
    <br>Someone is busy settling your finances!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Someone is somewhere settling my business!"
    <br>Someone is busy settling my career!
    <br>Someone is busy settling my business!
    <br>Someone is busy settling my finances!
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Hallelujah!  Thank you.
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again.
