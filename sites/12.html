    <br>WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS
    <br>A journal of prophecies for the outgoing years, by TB Joshua
    <br>Rushed Out
    <br>Emmanuel! My name is Ruth reporting for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>God is with us! If God is with you, He will strengthen you to remain calm and determined
    <br>even when everything around you seems to be unquiet.
    <br>On Sunday the 29th of June, 2008
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua reveals a prophetic message about one of the world leaders.
    <br>Let's listen to what he said.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Remember Tuesday and Thursday
    <br>and pray for one of your leaders that will be rushed out of the country.
    <br>Pray.
    <br>A lot is happening on the other side.
    <br>I see the body being rushed, in order to save the soul - rushed out of the country.
    <br>So pray.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Let the will of God be done.
    <br>This is flag. I'm seeing a flag.
    <br>But I will not say anything more than that flag.
    <br>Is it flying or flying down?
    <br>That is...
    <br>Baba God knows.
    <br>What is happening to the flag? Is it coming down? What is wrong?
    <br>So, over to Baba God.
    <br>On the 6th of July, 2008
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua further explained the revelation.
    <br>Let's listen to what he said.
    <br>You remember, there is a message I gave that one of our leaders would be rushed out suddenly.
    <br>Where there is gathering, meeting, something will happen that they will rush him out.
    <br>Since then, I have been praying that the Lord should save this soul.
    <br>We have been fasting and praying.
    <br>A lot I have seen - and the outcome of that vision, I have seen it.
    <br>I am only just saying it but we are praying.
    <br>I'm still seeing the battle going on in the spirit.
    <br>Is it up, down?
    <br>We pray everyday for the whole world.
    <br>Each time the Lord shows something on the other side, we pray everyday.
    <br>We are still praying that the Lord should rescue the life
    <br>because I'm seeing the other side - a lot is happening on the other side.
    <br>The man of God then led the congregation and the viewers worldwide
    <br>in a time of prayer for the leader whom the message concerned.
    <br>When God says, 'Yes', no one can say, 'No.'
    <br>We are only trying to say, "God, please" to know His mind about the matter.
    <br>What we are talking about is going up, is going down.
    <br>We need prayer to make it stable.
    <br>Let us go on our knees.
    <br>I'm coming back to the heart of worship
    <br>When it's all about You
    <br>It's all about You Jesus
    <br>I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made it
    <br>When it's all about You
    <br>It's all about You Jesus
    <br>It's all about You, Lord. We are here, Lord, in humility, Lord.
    <br>Ask Him for salvation, mercy and favour.
    <br>Your mercy and favour we ask for the leader whom the message concerns.
    <br>Lord, Your mercy and Your favour.
    <br>Let Your will be done.
    <br>Rise up!
    <br>I don't mean any other leader than the heads of states.
    <br>The head of a country.
    <br>But I'm standing here to tell you that I'm praying.
    <br>For the past six days now, I have been praying.
    <br>That flag means life - the life that goes up, down.
    <br>Please, use Psalm 61, most especially verses 3 and 4.
    <br>Pray with it and fast.
    <br>Let the will of God be done.
    <br>There is nothing we can do.
    <br>Can you please read Psalm 61.
    <br>Psalm 61, verse 3 and 4.
    <br>"For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe, I long to dwell in your tent forever
    <br>and take refuge in the shelter of your wings."
    <br>Read it and pray. Take note of verses 3 and 4 which I told you are very important.
    <br>Offer your prayer.
    <br>Like I have said, let the will of God be done.
    <br>So, take it as your own personal duty and pray for the soul.
    <br>On Tuesday, the 1st of July 2008, Zambian president Levi Mwanawasa was rushed to Paris
    <br>after suffering a stroke.
    <br>According to the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua which said: "Pray for one of your leaders
    <br>that will be rushed out of the country" - this is precisely what happened.
    <br>A Zambian president Levi Mwanawasa was air lifted from Egypt to a hospital in Paris, France,
    <br>whilst he was in a coma.
    <br>He had suffered a stroke and brain hemorrhage on the 29th of June on the eve of African Union Summit.
    <br>On Thursday, the 3rd of July 2008,
    <br>numerous news reports offered conflicting information regarding state of health of the Zambian president.
    <br>Some reports stated that the president had died,
    <br>while others refuted those reports claiming that the president was alive and in a stable condition.
    <br>Let's watch the report of what happened.
    <br>BREAKING NEWS
    <br>This news just coming in to CNN - the president of Zambia Levi Mwanawasa has died.
    <br>The 59-year-old was at the African Union Summit in Egypt where he fell ill and was transferred
    <br>to a Paris hospital with an apparent brain hemorrhage.
    <br>There were earlier reports that he died which have been denied by the information minister of Zambia.
    <br>But now we are receiving confirmation that indeed,
    <br>the president of Zambia Levi Mwanawasa is dead in a Paris hospital.
    <br>These contradictory reports together with unstable health condition of the Zambian president
    <br>confirmed the explanation given by the man of God when he said,
    <br>"I am seeing flag. Is it flying or flying down? Baba God knows."
    <br>On a subsequent Live Sunday Service Prophet T.B. Joshua gave another word of prophesy
    <br>concerning this important person that the world still needs.
    <br>Let's listen to what he said.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Remember the message I gave last week and I said we should pray
    <br>and we should fast and pray for protection for someone whom the world still needs.
    <br>I'm seeing such person taking his luggage.
    <br>How soon?
    <br>He's arranging his luggage, going to eternity -
    <br>a house of no return.
    <br>I gave that message last week.
    <br>We fasted and prayed.
    <br>And I'm seeing this affecting not just his family or whatever but a nation.
    <br>Can you imagine how big, how important the person is?
    <br>They will do everything in terms of science, technology to revive the situation but no way.
    <br>When Jesus says, "Yes", no one can say, "No."
    <br>On Tuesday, the 19th of August 2008,
    <br>at 10 am president Levi Mwanawasa died in hospital in Paris at the age of 59 -
    <br>49 days after he was first rushed to Paris after suffering a stroke.
    <br>Let's watch the report.
    <br>BREAKING NEWS
    <br>Now this is just in to CNN. Zambian president Levi Mwanawasa has died in a Paris hospital.
    <br>He has been battling ill health for a year now, including second stroke back in June.
    <br>Official say the country is planning seven days of national mourning.
    <br>Two months after he was hospitalized in Paris for stroke Levi Mwanawasa was 59.
    <br>He led the country from 2002 and was widely praised for his economic savvy.
    <br>He also defied the traditional code of silence in Africa by criticizing the autocratic style of Robert Mugabe,
    <br>president of neighbouring Zimbabwe.
    <br>Mr Mwanawasa fell ill in late June at an African Union Summit in Egypt.
    <br>The cause of death was not revealed but the Zambian president had a long history of poor health.
    <br>In confirmation of the Prophet's words: "They will do everything in terms
    <br>of science and technology to revive the situation but no way."
    <br>During Mwanawasa's hospitalisation at the Percy Military Hospital in Paris
    <br>he underwent many treatments and surgeries.
    <br>Despite reports that he was making progress in his recovery, his condition remained critical,
    <br>until finally, on August 18 his condition deteriorated and the following morning he passed away,
    <br>in further confirmation of the Prophet's words:
    <br>"I'm seeing it affecting not just his family or whatever but a nation."
    <br>News of the president's death was met with grief in the Zambian nation
    <br>where the vice president Banda declared seven days of national mourning.
    <br>President Mwanawasa was the third president of Zambia
    <br>after it's independence from Britain in 1964 and served the country twice as president
    <br>and once as vice president.
    <br>He was well-known for his integrity, his stand for democracy in Southern Africa
    <br>and his fight against government corruption.
    <br>In a statement, French president Nicolas Sarkozy called Mwanawasa's death
    <br>a great loss for the Zambian people, who respected and had great affection for him,
    <br>as well as a great loss for the African continent as a whole which appreciated his political courage;
    <br>and also a loss for democracy for which he was an ardent defender his whole life.
    <br>He ended with the words: "France salutes his memory full of courage and liberty."
    <br>US president George W. Bush commented that he was saddened by the death of the Zambian president
    <br>saying: "President Mwanawasa was a champion of democracy in his own country and throughout Africa."
    <br>As president of Zambia, president Mwanawasa launched a sweeping anticorruption campaign
    <br>and dedicated himself to improving the welfare of all Zambians.
    <br>We extend our sincere condolences to President Mwanawasa's wife, his family and all Zambians
    <br>during this difficult time.
    <br>We at Emmanuel TV and The SCOAN thank God for the prophetic messages
    <br>He has revealed His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We pray for the family of President Levi Mwanawasa, the government and the citizens of Zambia.
    <br>To the departed soul, we say "Shalom", to the friends and well-wishers we say "Emmanuel",
    <br>to the Almighty God we say "Hello!"
