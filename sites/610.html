    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Good morning, Church!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers, we recognise you; wherever you are, whatever position you are in, Jesus knows better.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Today we will look at some challenges that relationships face.
    <br>The Book of Romans 12:1-2, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy,
    <br>to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God -
    <br>this is your true and proper worship.
    <br>Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
    <br>Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - His good, pleasing and perfect will."
    <br>Let me take you to the verse 19 there.
    <br>Romans 12:19-20, "Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath,
    <br>for it is written: 'It is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord.
    <br>On the contrary: 'If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.
    <br>In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.'"
    <br>I will take the last verse now - verse 21 says:
    <br>"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good" - Romans 12:21.
    <br>When you look at the Book of Proverbs 10:12:
    <br>"Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers all wrongs."
    <br>Countless Christians are imprisoned by offences.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because of wounds and hurts which offences have caused in our lives,
    <br>most of us cannot function properly in our profession.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can do better than what you are doing
    <br>but because of offences, you find that you cannot function properly in your profession.
    <br>I mean, in your working place.
    <br>You cannot function properly.
    <br>When you look here - offence; here - offence.
    <br>Offence has become an epidemic, everywhere.
    <br>Suddenly, your boss at your working place can just look at you and say, "OK, I demote you".
    <br>"What have I done?"
    <br>Suddenly, you will see someone who is subject to you, who submits to you,
    <br>who you instruct every day, will be asked to be your boss.
    <br>You say, "Ha!"
    <br>Someone whom you were sending on errands in your working place, your junior,
    <br>someone you trained over time to become what he is.
    <br>Your boss will suddenly give the instruction that he should be your boss and you should submit to him.
    <br>How would you take that?
    <br>Someone, whom you have trained over time in your working place, in the same company
    <br>and because he is a family member of the owner of the company, he is a relation,
    <br>suddenly, the instruction will just come for him to become your boss and you are to submit to him.
    <br>He himself will suddenly change his tactic and strategy.
    <br>Before, he would submit to you and say, "My boss. Good afternoon, sir".
    <br>But suddenly, when he becomes your boss, he will avoid you.
    <br>He will now begin to send someone to you, that you should report there.
    <br>How would you take it?
    <br>By the time you get to the conference, you will find him sitting in front of you,
    <br>in the position of boss, giving instructions.
    <br>You know how they look like,
    <br>"Yes, this is very important. We should carry out this instruction..."
    <br>You know - there are "dark shades" nowadays.
    <br>Do you know "dark shades"?
    <br>OK, when you don't want to see someone around you, you put on "dark shades".
    <br>He will now begin to say, "Yes, we have to take the instruction.
    <br>The head of marketing (he is referring to you) should immediately tomorrow make sure
    <br>that this department is being taken care of,
    <br>and he should submit the form and report to me the next day.
    <br>Thank you. This is just an instruction I wanted to give you. Bye". He will stand up.
    <br>And if the boss has not gone, you cannot stand up.
    <br>You cannot leave or stand up at the same time as your boss.
    <br>He has to leave.
    <br>Because of wounds and hurts which offences have caused in our lives,
    <br>most of us cannot function properly in our profession.
    <br>Each time you carry out an assignment, you will remember someone you trained.
    <br>You will not want to give your best, and your best is needed.
    <br>You begin to think.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We cannot function properly because we are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>We cannot function properly because we are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.
    <br>It is difficult.
    <br>We carry anger, hatred, bitterness, and hurt against someone.
    <br>You believe you can function properly when you are carrying anger and hatred.
    <br>That is self-imprisonment.
    <br>Self what?
    <br>Self-imprisonment.
    <br>It is not that we are asked to go to prison; there are many of us in prison.
    <br>And this is a most serious prison.
    <br>When we talk of prison, we only think about those who are inside the prison.
    <br>There are countless people...
    <br>90% of the whole world are in what?
    <br>[In prison]
    <br>Self-imprisonment.
    <br>Many are victims of self-imprisonment.
    <br>You are imprisoned by anger, hatred, bitterness, hurt and unforgiveness.
    <br>Offence imprisons countless Christians, severs relationships
    <br>and widens the existing breaches between us.
    <br>Unless we release ourselves, God will not hear us.
    <br>We are hindered and handicapped from fulfilling our full potential.
    <br>To hold an offence against someone hinders and handicaps us from fulfilling our full potential.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence, as a Christian.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence against someone.
    <br>Listen to our Lord's prayer - we don't take it seriously.
    <br>It is fundamental.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning to move with Jesus - this is fundamental.
    <br>Remember the Lord's prayer.
    <br>He said, "Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us".
    <br>Have you? Do you forgive?
    <br>"Daily bread" means each day has its own grace.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence against someone.
    <br>Some of our offences emanate from our close and dearest ones.
    <br>The higher the expectation, the greater the fall.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The higher the expectation, the greater the fall".
    <br>Some of our offences emanate from our close and dear ones such as father, mother, wife, husband or children.
    <br>The Book of Psalm 55 - I will take my reading from verse 12,
    <br>"If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it".
    <br>I like that.
    <br>"But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend." – Psalm 55:13
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Some of our offences emanate from our close and dearest ones.
    <br>If my enemy had offended me, I would not have bothered
    <br>but for you, my close friend, a man of my equal, my companion, my acquaintance.
    <br>Our families and our homes, which are meant to be a source of inspiration,
    <br>protection, provision and growth, where we learn to give love and receive love,
    <br>are often the very root of our pain -
    <br>brother against brother, father against brother, son against father and mother against son.
    <br>Battlefield of fight – family, home, a fellow Christian brother, a close friend, companion.
    <br>Rise up, and let us pray.
    <br>You want to release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you.
    <br>Release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you.
    <br>Begin to release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you and promise that you will do restitution.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, begin to release yourself.
    <br>Promise you will do restitution.
    <br>Open your lips, viewers all over the world.
    <br>Those who have wronged you in one form or another.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I release you, in the name of Jesus, from the pain of the past!
    <br>I release you from deep hurt – be released!
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, once again, listen:
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus, from the pain of the past!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold onto an offence.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Countless people, I mean, countless Christians are imprisoned by offence.
    <br>It is a trap; it is an effective instrument used by satan.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>If you are a victim, I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Release yourself – this is the key.
    <br>Release yourself; whether you are wrong or right, you have no right to hold onto an offence.
    <br>Right now, release yourself by forgiving those who have wronged you in one form or another.
    <br>You have been imprisoning yourself for so long.
    <br>You have been imprisoning yourself – blessing has been looking for you but you are in the prison.
    <br>Victory has been looking for you for so long but you are in the prison.
    <br>Deliverance has been looking for you but you are in the prison.
    <br>Healing has been looking for you for so long but you are in the prison.
    <br>Promotion you are looking for has been looking for you for so long whereas you are in the prison.
    <br>Self-imprisonment -
    <br>you create that; you put yourself in the prison.
    <br>You say, "I'm right. They abuse me. They misjudge me."
    <br>Healing you are looking for has been looking for you for so long now, whereas you are in the prison.
    <br>You have to release yourself.
    <br>When you release yourself - that is the key - then they will find you.
    <br>Offence imprisons countless Christians, severs relationships
    <br>and widens the existing breaches between us.
    <br>There is trouble already, before that offence comes.
    <br>When the offence now comes, it widens.
    <br>Our Lord's prayer - "Forgive us" - this is what you ask God for, but He gives us a condition;
    <br>"I will forgive you only if you can forgive others".
    <br>That is the condition He gave you.
    <br>The condition is: "I will forgive you as far as you are ready to forgive others".
    <br>Those who wronged you - whether you are wrong or right...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You have been imprisoning yourself for so long".
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Say, "I have been imprisoning myself for so long".
    <br>God says, "I will not do for you what you can do yourself".
    <br>You say, "It is difficult for me".
    <br>No. You have to.
    <br>He will not do for you what you can do yourself.
    <br>When you release yourself, healing, deliverance and protection will find you.
    <br>Just name it.
    <br>That is my secret.
    <br>That is the secret to move forward now because you have imprisoned yourself.
    <br>You made a promise you failed to fulfill.
    <br>We made a vow we failed to fulfill – "Forgive me, Lord, as I forgive those who sin against me."
    <br>When you are not forgiving others, what you are asking Him, He will not give.
    <br>I want everyone of us to open our mouth and say this,
    <br>"Forgive me as I forgive those who sin against me".
    <br>Did you?
    <br>You know the meaning of covenant.
    <br>People pay with their blood when they break a covenant in this world.
    <br>Covenant keeping God
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Alpha Omega 
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Covenant keeping God
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Alpha Omega 
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Covenant keeping God
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Alpha Omega 
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Covenant keeping God
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Alpha Omega 
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Covenant keeping God
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Alpha Omega 
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>It is a testament - meaning covenant.
    <br>The word testament.
    <br>You are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Say, "I am holding someone hostage of unforgiveness".
    <br>Tell yourself.
    <br>[I am holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[I am holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.]
    <br>Viewers, listen to me.
    <br>You are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.
    <br>What do I mean, viewers?
    <br>I mean, you carry anger, hurt, bitterness, envy and jealousy against someone.
    <br>To hold an offence against someone hinders and handicaps us from fulfilling our full potential.
    <br>You see that there is a restriction; the key is to release yourself.
    <br>To release yourself is your role.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus, from the pain of the past!
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong – be released!
    <br>Hurt, deep hurt – be released!
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong – be released!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I release you in the name of Jesus,
    <br>from the pain of the past, from hurt, deep hurt - be released!
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, once again, listen – I release you, in the name of Jesus, from the pain of the past, from hurt -
    <br>I mean, deep hurt - be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold onto an offence.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Countless people – I mean, countless Christians are imprisoned by offence.
    <br>It's a trap; it's an effective instrument used by satan.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>If you are a victim,
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's not too late; God's time is the best.
    <br>Now, you are released.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Say, "I'm released!"
    <br>Begin to rejoice in your release!
    <br>Rejoice.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm guilty of hatred and unforgiveness.
    <br>I'm holding many people hostage but I never knew because when some certain things happened to me,
    <br>instead of me to let go of that particular thing, I would just continue to hold onto that.
    <br>I never knew it would be like this; I don’t understand.
    <br>I think the problem is from upbringing.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>He knows the value of what we are talking about.
    <br>He knows where he is supposed to have been.
    <br>Many of us don't understand what we are talking about.
    <br>When you know where you are supposed to be and you are not there, it's very painful.
    <br>Look at me.
    <br>I - T.B. Joshua - for the last 35 years, revelation keeps coming concerning my future.
    <br>Imagine I am not where God wants me to be today.
    <br>I don't know what would have happened to me.
    <br>Because we don't have revelation about ourselves.
    <br>You don't know what God has in store for you.
    <br>If you have been dreaming, seeing where God is taking you to and you are not there,
    <br>and you know this is where you are supposed to be but you are not there,
    <br>you will take the issue seriously.
    <br>Have you released yourself now?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You have released yourself.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's carry on.
    <br>The more your pain, the greater your experience.
    <br>You stayed so long in the same class.
    <br>In each class at university, you are supposed to spend one year, but you have a carry-over - a retake -
    <br>and you spend three years in the same class.
    <br>If you are serious, you would be more intelligent and wiser and learn a lot of lessons.
    <br>I think it is not too bad if you stayed long in a class.
    <br>You need to learn what you need to know before getting to where God wants you to be.
    <br>If not, you will be dislodged and replaced by satan.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You need to learn enough experience.
    <br>If not, you will be dislodged – I mean, replaced by satan".
    <br>You need to know the pain of being a poor man so as to maintain the position of a rich man.
    <br>You need to know the pain of being a sick man so as to maintain the position of good health.
    <br>You need to know the pain of being disappointed so as to maintain the position of appointment.
    <br>Brother, you are released.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>And I want to assure you - you are released.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
