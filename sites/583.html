  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If we sang songs of faith more and talked less,
    <br>the world would be more Heavenly.
    <br>The POWER Of Change!!! | TB Joshua
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The POWER Of Change!!! | TB Joshua
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>I know you know - this is your day.
    <br>The POWER Of Change!!! | TB Joshua
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of John 4:17.
    <br>That will be our proof text - John 4 from verse1.
    <br>"Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees
    <br>had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John
    <br>though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples,
    <br>He left Judea and departed again to Galilee."
    <br>Let's go to the proof text there - verse 17.
    <br>"The woman answered and said, 'I have no husband.'
    <br>Jesus said to her, 'You have well said, 'I have no husband,'
    <br>for you have had five husbands,... "
    <br>This is the woman that says, "I have no husband".
    <br>Jesus is now saying, "...for you have had five husbands,
    <br>and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly'."
    <br>This is a prophetic word.
    <br>After she tried to say her "own",
    <br>Jesus is now telling her things of the Spirit - this is prophecy.
    <br>"The woman said to Him, 'Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet'."
    <br>That is, "For You to know this without me telling you - wow, what a Prophet".
    <br>Verse 20:
    <br>"Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, and you Jews say that
    <br>in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship."
    <br>It is only the power of change that can do this.
    <br>From darkness to light.
    <br>Faith is the transformative power of the universe.
    <br>The power of change.
    <br>A change from sickness to good health.
    <br>A change from yoke to deliverance.
    <br>A change from weakness to strength.
    <br>A faithless generation to a faithful generation.
    <br>A change from poverty to blessing.
    <br>Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well.
    <br>He mentioned that she had had five marriages and pointed her to her future.
    <br>He promised that He would give her water and she would never thirst again.
    <br>Perhaps you were given a vision or dream and you never believed it
    <br>because it overwhelmed you, more than you could imagine.
    <br>No matter the circumstance, no matter what happens, with God all things are possible.
    <br>No matter the circumstance, no matter what happens...
    <br>It could be your business or your health.
    <br>It could be your marriage, your career.
    <br>With Jesus in your life, you would be in a future state
    <br>as if it were already true or here.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be a tomorrow thinker!"
    <br>When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, He becomes your coach.
    <br>When Jesus becomes your coach,
    <br>you would be asked to see what is not yet seen;
    <br>you would be asked to do what is not yet done
    <br>and you would be asked to say what is not yet said.
    <br>When Jesus becomes your coach,
    <br>you would be asked to do what is not yet done and
    <br>you would be asked to say what is not yet said.
    <br>Until you experience Jesus, there would be dissatisfaction in your life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Until you experience Jesus, there would be dissatisfaction in your life."
    <br>A sense of hunger to know what life is all about.
    <br>A desire to know what happens after life is over.
    <br>Until you experience Jesus, there would be dissatisfaction in your life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Until you experience Jesus, there would be dissatisfaction in your life.]
    <br>When Jesus becomes your coach,
    <br>you would be asked to see what is not yet seen;
    <br>you would be asked to do what is not yet done and
    <br>you would be asked to say what is not yet said.
    <br>Jesus is a problem solver.
    <br>Never a burden He cannot bear.
    <br>When you have exhausted your mental and emotional resources,
    <br>you can no longer rely on yourself.
    <br>You simply need to trust something,
    <br>someone stronger, wiser and smarter than yourself.
    <br>Jesus who can raise the dead is our choice.
    <br>That is why we are here today.
    <br>He delivered me and He can deliver you.
    <br>He rescued me and He will rescue you.
    <br>He will, in the future.
    <br>"Stay where you are" - tell your neighbour.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stay where you are, hold steady and trust."
    <br>Never a problem He cannot solve.
    <br>Never a burden He cannot bear.
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot cure.
    <br>Don't listen to the temptation to act out of character.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't listen to the temptation to act out of character."
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Don't listen to the temptation to act out of character.]
    <br>Don't listen to the temptation to act out of character
    <br>or react badly to the emotional weight that you are experiencing.
    <br>All honour
    <br>All glory
    <br>All power to You
    <br>All honour
    <br>All glory
    <br>All power to You
    <br>Holy Father we worship You
    <br>Blessed Jesus our Saviour
    <br>Holy Spirit we wait on You
    <br>For fire
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Jesus loves me just as He does any of His apostles."
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Jesus loves me just as He does any of His apostles.]
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The POWER Of Change!!! | TB Joshua
    <br>Remember, don't listen to the temptation to act out of character.
    <br>Your temptation talks, your situation talks.
    <br>It will be telling you, "Your prayer will not be answered. There is no way".
    <br>Doubts, telling you 'unfaithfulness', condemning everything you are saying,
    <br>telling you, "Don't pray, don't listen to Him".
    <br>Jesus is the answer!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't listen to the temptation to act out of character
    <br>or react badly to the emotional weight that you are experiencing."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
