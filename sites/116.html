  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet TB Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen right now.
    <br>Engage with God
    <br>Viewers at home, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Right now, join me.
    <br>Begin to break your will, satan's will.
    <br>Right now, I break your will, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I break satan's will in your life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I break your will, satan's will in your life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your will says this way; satan's will says that way.
    <br>In this case, Jesus cannot be involved.
    <br>He wants to take control of your life.
    <br>He will not wrestle with your will and satan's will.
    <br>He wants to be your landlord.
    <br>He doesn't want to be a tenant.
    <br>Jesus cannot be a tenant in your life.
    <br>This is a house.
    <br>Jesus wants to be the landlord, not a tenant.
    <br>Your will, satan's will be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Sin's power over you be broken!
    <br>Sin's power over your life, be broken!
    <br>Power of immorality, be broken!
    <br>Power of idolatry, be broken!
    <br>Power of unfaithfulness, be broken!
    <br>Disobedience, be broken!
    <br>Anger, be broken!
    <br>Pride, be broken!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet TB Joshua 
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God
    <br>as you send your testimony.
    <br>Engage with God
