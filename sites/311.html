  <p>    
    <br>Madam, can I help you?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You shouldn't surrender just like that.
    <br>Okay, sir.
    <br>It's too quick for you to just say that you have surrendered.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>What happened is a matter of settlement. 
    <br>Let them settle the matter.
    <br>Okay, sir.
    <br>You are at fault.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You know, you are at fault?
    <br>How?
    <br>All my friend said was true and what I did to my family.
    <br>The things I did to my family are all true.
    <br>My name is Chidiebere Agba
    <br>and this is my family.
    <br>I'm a native of Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>Last week Sunday, the man of God came to me and prophesied that
    <br>I shouldn't surrender, that it is all about settlement.
    <br>He said that I was at fault.
    <br>You shouldn't surrender just like that.
    <br>Okay, sir.
    <br>It's too quick for you to just say that you have surrendered.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>What happened is a matter of settlement. Let them settle the matter.
    <br>Okay , sir.
    <br>You are at fault.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You know, you're at fault?
    <br>Which is true.
    <br>I've grown up to be a sadist in society.
    <br>When the force comes, I can't control myself.
    <br>It all started when I was in Madona, a missionary school.
    <br>My intention was to go to that school and afterwards go into a convent
    <br>but when I entered, I met other things in the school.
    <br>In the missionary school, we were not meant to go out
    <br>but we always jumped the fence and went clubbing.
    <br>That was in SS1 (Senior Secondary School),
    <br>we started clubbing and hanging out with university graduates.
    <br>Before I graduated from Madona,
    <br>one of my friends and I never liked seeing people happy.
    <br>Whenever we saw friends talking, my friend would come and ask me
    <br>who they were because they would eat and go to the canteen together.
    <br>They wouldn't say anything to me but thoughts would go through mind;
    <br>I would call one of them out and say some things,
    <br>if she did not buy into my idea, I would leave.
    <br>Some weeks after, I would go to the friend's corner.
    <br>Any night I wanted to go to the toilet, I must penetrate people's corner.
    <br>I would take what belonged to one friend and plant it in the other girl's bag.
    <br>I then happened to be a prefect in school.
    <br>I started handling posts in my JSS3(Junior Secondary School).
    <br>Then I was the Assistant Social Prefect.
    <br>When they called for a prefect meeting,
    <br>I would make a suggestion which would be part of my plan.
    <br>When the person was caught, she would be disgraced
    <br>and sometimes be brought before the school panel.
    <br>If you are caught three times in a missionary school stealing,
    <br>you would be expelled from the school.
    <br>Some people were expelled because of me.
    <br>That was how I grew up.
    <br>My parents are the best thing that ever happened to me.
    <br>They made sure I had whatever I wanted.
    <br>Before the visiting day at school, they would send me whatever I wanted
    <br>such as two sets of large provisions but I would never eat it.
    <br>I would keep it and take it home to them.
    <br>I didn't touch my provisions, I would rather take from other peoples'.
    <br>I never ate mine, I would rather send it back to my family.
    <br>When I took my girlfriend's provisions, I would plant them in another person's bag.
    <br>My guardian at school flogged me one day and I set her up
    <br>because I didn't like someone correcting me.
    <br>Before I left Madona, something happened;
    <br>There was a day I went clubbing; my parents never told me that they were visiting
    <br>and surprised me but I was not in the school premises.
    <br>They called me and my girlfriend never told me that she was returning.
    <br>She came back without my knowledge while I was still in the campus in Akwa,
    <br>Nnamdi Azikwe University, hanging out with those guys.
    <br>When my parents called, I went back but they had already left and were angry.
    <br>The school punished me because of that.
    <br>The only friend I called 'friend', I could never hurt her
    <br>but because of what she did, my parents were angry with me.
    <br>I hurt her to the core.
    <br>When I left the school, it continued.
    <br>I could never respect you, no matter who you thought you were.
    <br>No one corrected me; the only person I listened to at times was my father.
    <br>My mother could not stand me, I would insult and walk out on her.
    <br>I only heard the voice of my father and didn't know why.
    <br>I was very good at making friends but the friendship would not last more than two days.
    <br>The longest a friendship with me could last was one week
    <br>before we would have serious issues.
    <br>This continued, I would take from people and plant it on others
    <br>so that the person would be embarrassed.
    <br>Recently, I no longer do that to people, rather I would keep things to myself.
    <br>Why the man of God said that I needed to settle is because I am not in good terms
    <br>with any of my friends or family.
    <br>I was meant to serve in Abuja but I left because of what happened.
    <br>In the camp, I had a very good friend, the only girl who stood by me,
    <br>believed me and worshipped me,
    <br>she washed my clothes and did everything for me.
    <br>On a sit out, I took her phone and switched it off.
    <br>I even personally reported the case to the Camp Commandant
    <br>that they needed to find the phone
    <br>because the Camp Commandant was my friend.
    <br>He went around the whole camp looking for that phone.
    <br>I was the hostel leader and helped him to look for that phone,
    <br>even in my own bag although it was inside my bag.
    <br>I opened my provisions, put it inside the milk and closed it.
    <br>Nobody could find it until my brother came to visit me.
    <br>This is my brother.
    <br>This continued and none of my brothers could help me out ever since I started this.
    <br>My brother here was the only one who stood by me.
    <br>No matter what I did, he would pay my bills.
    <br>Whatever I wanted, he made sure that I didn't lack.
    <br>There was something I did one day and he beat me.
    <br>I got angry and vowed to destroy him.
    <br>The only girl he ever loved, I said a lot of things about him to the girl,
    <br>that he was infected with diseases and that the girl should keep off.
    <br>I even tried to take the girl's phone to see if I could get her parent's numbers, but I couldn't.
    <br>Then, I didn't know what else to do.
    <br>When I was in the camp, I took that phone and sold it to him.
    <br>I wanted to give it to him but I told him that I didn't have money, knowing that I was a student.
    <br>He gave me money for the phone and I gave it to him.
    <br>The person in question happened to be my close friend.
    <br>She was always in my house 24/7.
    <br>We ate together, she stayed with my parents,
    <br>she would enter my brother's room and they would chat.
    <br>I knew that definitely she would see the phone there.
    <br>When she caught him with the phone, they embarrassed him.
    <br>This is my brother.
    <br>He dealt with me seriously that day.
    <br>I never knew what came over me but then, they never knew what I was doing.
    <br>I tried to make him have a serious accident.
    <br>I tried to open his car's fuel tank but it was always locked.
    <br>I couldn't open the bonnet.
    <br>Early every morning, if my parents could remember,
    <br>the dog always barked as early as four.
    <br>There was a particular knife I always slept with; I would come out and puncture the tyres.
    <br>Whenever he was driving, he had a flat tyre.
    <br>That continued.
    <br>One day, my mother said to me, "This quarrel you have with your brother,
    <br>he is suspecting that you are the one puncturing the tyres".
    <br>I didn't know where to damage his car, I just wanted to see him have pain
    <br>because he scratched my body and blood dropped, I wanted his own blood to flow.
    <br>That was why I wanted to do that.
    <br>There was no way I could plant anything into his car but to puncture his tyres.
    <br>The last time, my parents had to come and bail me out
    <br>and they told me that they would never do it again.
    <br>This continued but after the phone incident, I was so ashamed of myself.
    <br>Another thing I did was that on a sit out with you, you may like me as a guy
    <br>but I wouldn't be interested in dating you.
    <br>It may seem as if you can pass by me and park your car to toast me,
    <br>my revenge would be to take your phone and look for your wife's number and save it.
    <br>Instead of sending you a text message, I would forward it to your wife,
    <br>"I am waiting for you, where are you?"
    <br>so that she would get offended and the two of you would have issues.
    <br>That was the only thing I would do to make you feel bad.
    <br>My sister here is a very good person; she does business and sells men's clothes.
    <br>When I saw that she was really moving up, I'd go to her house,
    <br>she would tell me how many customers she had to meet
    <br>and I would say, "Very good, let me wait for you".
    <br>It hurt me when people turned my offer down.
    <br>She would tell me that she wanted to lock her house.
    <br>This made me to think that she felt I would steal her things.
    <br>I would ask her where she was doing her supply and she would tell me.
    <br>I would then tell her that I was going home either to my house or to my family's house.
    <br>I am very well known in Bwari, Abuja where she stays.
    <br>So, if I entered anywhere, I would spoil that market for her.
    <br>Some people even owe her and cannot pay her anymore because of what I said.
    <br>I would make sure that I gave the number out to the wife of that man,
    <br>"My sister is not selling clothes to your husband, she is busy sleeping with him".
    <br>Just to afflict pain on her and her business.
    <br>I didn't like to see people happy.
    <br>Regardless of that, my family still stood by me.
    <br>Why do you not want to see people being happy?
    <br>I was the evil spirit in me; I was a sadist.
    <br>I didn't see me and a husband together.
    <br>I moved on my own.
    <br>I didn't know why they would always stop but I didn't want to date them.
    <br>I didn't want to but they'd keep pestering me.
    <br>So, I would cause problems for them and go
    <br>and cause them to have issues in their homes.
    <br>The truth is that after dating in my secondary school and passing through those things
    <br>and what my friend introduced me to and following men,
    <br>the way they mess you up and just leave you, I vowed that I didn't want to get married.
    <br>But people kept coming.
    <br>I did not want to see anyone.
    <br>None of my friends could open their mouths and tell me they were getting married;
    <br>I would spoil that relationship.
    <br>Tell me the guy; I would tell her she would have to watch this guy -
    <br>he is a womaniser, instead of encouraging them.
    <br>Out of being a friend, she would take me to the guy's house.
    <br>I would go back and spoil it for her.
    <br>I would rather introduce her to another man.
    <br>When she was with the man, I would take photos of her
    <br>and record their conversation and send it to the man who wanted to get married to her.
    <br>That was how they would keep breaking up their relationships.
    <br>Can you see why you should examine everything?
    <br>Whatever you hear from your husband, no matter how serious the issue is,
    <br>whatever you hear from your wife, no matter how serious the issue is -
    <br>you need to ask God.
    <br>You need to find out the truth.
    <br>Fifty percent of marriages today are divorced, because of these fetish lies.
    <br>My father is a contractor and well respected in my church
    <br>but because of this, he would hardly get jobs.
    <br>People insulted them in public.
    <br>When they came back home, they were always in tears.
    <br>When my father was sad, I'd ask him what the problem was but he wouldn't tell me.
    <br>Later, when he was scolding me, he would mention it.
    <br>Those who are owing him for the last job he did, upon asking them for the money
    <br>they would say that he should ask his daughter to steal and give to him.
    <br>That has brought a lot of shame to the family.
    <br>My mum is suffering from high blood pressure because of me.
    <br>Those were the reasons I left Abuja because I couldn't stand watching my family in shame.
    <br>I couldn't even walk on the street because my friends called me names.
    <br>Man of God, all I ask is for your help to deliver me.
    <br>For how many years has this spirit been tormenting you?
    <br>Since I was in secondary school.
    <br>I know that all these started in my JSS3 Junior Secondary School),
    <br>after giving me the post of 'Assistant Regulator'.
    <br>That's when I grew up with this - 12 to 15 years I have been with this but I can't control myself.
    <br>When things were being done, after about 30 minutes, I would get myself
    <br>but there'd be no way I could apologise to these people; I'd rather move on.
    <br>Since the Spirit of God fetched you out, I will not allow you to go, unless you are delivered.
    <br>I ENJOY Making Men CRY!!!
    <br>Tell us, what lesson you have.
    <br>All I will say is that...
    <br>Sometimes, single-sex schools are very bad.
    <br>Female school is very bad because you meet a lot of things.
    <br>Your school mother can keep you as a sex machine.
    <br>A lot of things go on there.
    <br>Either you meet lesbians, people who would encourage you not to follow men
    <br>but to rather be with them.
    <br>Secondly, I would always advise my fellow girls and others
    <br>to try and appreciate those who are happy and be happy with them,
    <br>rejoice with them and don't be a sadist
    <br>because right now, I am really regretting all my acts.
    <br>You know, you have never regretted like this before.
    <br>No, I have never.
    <br>To the extent of crying...
    <br>This is to tell you that the end has come.
    <br>I ENJOY Making Men CRY!!!
    <br>I want to appeal to the family, to extend the hands of deliverance also towards them
    <br>because I know the lady has negatively affected not only the society but the family too.
    <br>Are you talking of the father or the brother or sister?
    <br>Listen to what our sister has said - it is a lesson to everyone of us - big lesson.
    <br>May God help us.
