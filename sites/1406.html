    <br>As T.B. Joshua's vehicle departed the school, due to the heavy rain which had fallen,
    <br>the vehicle loses its tracks and begins to slip and slide in the thick mud.

    <br>Even when the team gets out and pushes the vehicle, after just a short distance,
    <br>the car slides back down even further.

    <br>No Option But To Continue Their Journey On Foot
    <br>It is a long, tiring, almost two-hour walk back to the city,
    <br>made all the more difficult by the thick squelchy mud.
    <br>A local farmer happens to pass by at that exact moment.
    <br>As he sees the team wading through the mud, he offers to take two people with him on the horse.
    <br>Ever the man of compassion, T.B. Joshua allows Mrs Evelyn Joshua and one of the team
    <br>to take the horse ride while they continue on foot along the muddy path.
    <br>Okay, the two of you - tell him.
    <br>For two people?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Two can go with him.

    <br>Viewers, see me eating like any other person on the street.
    <br>Yes, I am running out of food.
    <br>That is humanitarian work for you.
    <br>Many a time we do this humanitarian work for God's sake
    <br>and we run out of what we have given.
    <br>We went to give blessing; now, we are running out of that blessing.
    <br>Occasionally, this has to happen to test our faith, to test our genuineness, to test our gracious giving -
    <br>whether it is genuine or not.
    <br>It is not all the time you give and God supplies.
    <br>At times, you give and the supply will not come.
    <br>Our vehicle cannot go any further.
    <br>They are looking for another vehicle.
    <br>Sometimes, you may not find a vehicle - we will sleep here.
    <br>Are you not ready to sleep?
    <br>We are ready to sleep!
    <br>Yes, sir!
    <br>We are going on a mission and it is not all missions that are smooth.
    <br>Some can be very, very tough.
    <br>We are just experiencing this now - the toughest mission we are experiencing,
    <br>we are going through and it is a blessing.
    <br>What a rare privilege to suffer for the needy.
    <br>There are many people out there but God chose us to come and do this.
    <br>I can see a snail!
    <br>While Walking Back From The School
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sights A Snail
    <br>Come and see the snail.
    <br>Yes, it is a big snail.
    <br>Not snake; it's a snail. Don't let the viewers feel threatened.
    <br>We are not looking for snakes; this is a snail.
    <br>Do you want to take this snail?
    <br>While Walking Back From The School
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sights A Snail
    <br>Wonderful - but we don't know where to eat it.
    <br>We need a fire.
    <br>Let's ask this man if he can help us; we have to eat.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Ask him whether he has seen the horse.
    <br>Did you see someone on a horse now?
    <br>From here? No.
    <br>We are waiting for a horse which was carrying our loved ones.
    <br>When we were coming, the vehicle could not go - we were too many.
    <br>A man with a horse helped to carry two of us; we are waiting for them.
    <br>Where is he living?
    <br>Here.
    <br>Okay, this house? I hope you will host us today if we cannot go?
    <br>Of course, no problem!

    <br>He said that he doesn't live far away and he used to walk here every day.
    <br>The young man, also a local farmer, offers T.B. Joshua and the team a place to take a breather,
    <br>while they wait for the team on the horse.

    <br>You can see the gate of my brother; we are just entering the gate.
    <br>This is the house we are going to.

    <br>Occasionally, times can come this way.
    <br>Whatever comes, we have to accept it.
    <br>We went to give food; we are running out of food now.
    <br>We went to give help; we are running out of help.
    <br>Sometimes, our faith can be tested.
    <br>It is not every time you give help that you will be helped.
    <br>So, this is the man God sent to us this time.
    <br>T.B. Joshua is introduced to the man's family and greets his daughter.

    <br>Thank you very much.

    <br>From The School Opening Day
    <br>He wanted to go to the school but it was raining and he could not make it.
    <br>I want to give them this 100 USD.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>T.B. Joshua blesses the family with 100 USD before he and the team take their leave.

    <br>Waving joyfully even after the long day, Mrs Joshua arrives on the horse
    <br>and the team gets ready to re-enter the vehicles and continue on their journey back to the city.
    <br>Before leaving, T.B. Joshua thanks the farmer who had assisted them with his horse.
