  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Thank you. Have your seat.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let's just dwell on the message we discontinued last Sunday.
    <br>Part 2 this time: Believe And Confess.
    <br>This actually relates to the reality of our daily life.
    <br>Let's take our reading to the Book of Matthew 12.
    <br>I will take my reading from verse 1; back to the proof text.
    <br>"At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath.
    <br>His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
    <br>When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him,
    <br>'Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.'"
    <br>Let's go to the proof text.
    <br>34.
    <br>"For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."
    <br>That shows that the word we speak determines the life we enjoy.
    <br>If heart and mouth both get in accord with God's Word,
    <br>it means the word we speak determines the life.
    <br>But if they are not according to the truth of God's Word,
    <br>they will remain idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>That is, the heart and mouth both get in accord with God's Word.
    <br>Last week, that Book of Romans 10 from verse 8 was our proof text.
    <br>What are we saying?
    <br>In a nutshell, we are saying, confession is part of salvation just as believing.
    <br>Confession is part of salvation just as believing.
    <br>Be a talking Christian, a reporting Christian, not only a doing one.
    <br>If you believe what you are doing, you will report.
    <br>If you believe what you are doing and hearing, you will report.
    <br>For you to be working and working - you are seeing the wrong around
    <br>and you decide not to say it or report it.
    <br>It means, you don't believe what you are doing.
    <br>Reporting should be an expression of believing
    <br>because if you believe in what you are doing, you will report.
    <br>If you believe in what you hear, you will report.
    <br>When we are expectant and you are given an assignment, "Oh, this is a job for you",
    <br>that job will not lead to success, unless you as well report;
    <br>at the same time you report the evil going on around.
    <br>We are expected to work as well as to report the wrong around
    <br>because when you are working without reporting, you are working in vain.
    <br>Working alone cannot help an establishment to grow.
    <br>Any establishment expects two things from you: working and reporting - for their growth.
    <br>That is why your company does not grow.
    <br>That is why our home is not in order.
    <br>When you report what you see, what you hear, it settles issues, it answers questions,
    <br>it provides a way forward, it clarifies doubt.
    <br>When you report what you see and hear, it settles issues.
    <br>A clear example is seen in Matthew 11:2-5 when John the Baptist sent his disciples
    <br>to clarify the identity of Jesus.
    <br>"Who is the man?"
    <br>And Jesus asked them to go and report to John what they had seen and heard.
    <br>Wherever you find yourself, you have to report what you see, what you hear.
    <br>You have to because work alone cannot help any establishment to grow.
    <br>That is why the companies do not grow.
    <br>You work; you see everyone working and working.
    <br>That cannot help the establishment to grow.
    <br>Establishment expects two things from you.
    <br>Working - everywhere working, working. No!
    <br>Working alone cannot help your family, your company, your ministry.
    <br>This is why Jesus said, go into the world and preach the Gospel.
    <br>What is the purpose of Emmanuel TV?
    <br>If not Emmanuel TV, you people would have clouded me here
    <br>and given me a name that Jesus has not given me.
    <br>You would have changed my name, if not Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That is reporter.
    <br>Say, "Good reporter".
    <br>Emmanuel TV - good reporter.
    <br>You can see everywhere - silent.
    <br>Emmanuel TV silenced them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The pharisees and sadducees - this Emmanuel TV has silenced everyone.
    <br>When you are telling people, "This is white", they say, "No, we have seen it is yellow".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have the mind of Christ.
    <br>1 Corinthians 2:16.
    <br>Don't be afraid to say you don't know if you don't.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Don't be afraid to say, "I don't know", if you don't know.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Don't be afraid to say, "I don't know", if you don't know.]
    <br>Satan hates an independent mind - a mind that will think for itself,
    <br>a mind that is determined to find out the truth from God.
    <br>"No! What you are telling me, I need to pray over it."
    <br>Satan hates that heart.
    <br>"No, what you are telling me... Ok. I need to pray over it.
    <br>I need to know the truth from God." - Satan hates that.
    <br>Satan wants you to take everything you hear and see without questioning.
    <br>Everything - "Oh yes, it's right."
    <br>Satan wants us to take everything we hear and see without questioning.
    <br>That is satan; he hates an independent mind - a mind that will think for itself,
    <br>that will determine to find out the truth from God.
    <br>He hates it; that is satan for you.
    <br>I just want to prepare you for this week you are about to enter.
    <br>That is why I'm here.
    <br>Working and reporting scrutinizes the relationship among us.
    <br>If you know I'm a very good reporter, you will be very careful to come near me.
    <br>"You know this man - I know what you are going to say.
    <br>He will report every wrong thing he sees."
    <br>"Oh, this man!"
    <br>You will talk less; go there and say the truth.
    <br>Working and reporting scrutinizes the relationship among us.
    <br>If you are one that works as well as reports,
    <br>people will be very careful the way and manner they work and relate with you
    <br>because they know you will report anything wrong.
    <br>This will naturally select those who will relate with you.
    <br>Naturally.
    <br>For it is said, "Show me your friends and I will tell you whom you are".
    <br>What you are today is a result of your friends.
    <br>You cannot do it alone; you need good friends, informed and disciplined ones.
    <br>But where will you get these in the town around you?
    <br>Where are they?
    <br>The friends we have around today are dividing, subtracting.
    <br>You know what is happening to you.
    <br>To have the right friend, you have to be a good reporter.
    <br>You have to stand to report every wrong that is going on.
    <br>Let the people know that this man - "Hm... He will report anything around him.
    <br>Anything that is wrong, he will report it."
    <br>That is only saving grace to have a like mind.
    <br>When you want to employ people in your company, that is the first question.
    <br>This - I know you will work, I know you are a hard-working guy.
    <br>But as well, you must report every wrong that is going on.
    <br>If not, you have not worked, you have not done anything right.
    <br>We must work as well as report.
    <br>For example, the way and manner your colleagues behave in an establishment
    <br>must be reported to help the establishment grow.
    <br>Unruly behaviours of other employees must be reported to help the establishment grow
    <br>not just becoming a hard worker.
    <br>The devil can work.
    <br>As we are talking now, the devil is working.
    <br>When you see many of your friends that you love so much,
    <br>later you discover it is the devil - they are very hard-working people.
    <br>But this is what the devil will not do:
    <br>The devil will not come to you and say, "Excuse me, there is a man
    <br>that is in a pool of blood there. He needs help".
    <br>The devil will not say that.
    <br>The devil will not say, "Because you are a smoker, that is why you have this tuberculosis".
    <br>He wants you to smoke more - the devil will not report this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So you have been here since morning.
    <br>What report do you have for me?
    <br>That is what we are saying.
    <br>But you want to receive miracle, deliverance, blessing
    <br>and at the end of the day, you do like this... - you are going.
    <br>You have been dancing since morning.
    <br>There are some funny men, funny women that are making noise, disturbing the group,
    <br>playing games on their set, playing games inside the church.
    <br>You see them and you know this is unruly behaviour.
    <br>If you don't report them, you are not here today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know some others, they have been moving from one group to another,
    <br>trying to make connections, sending a paper to groups.
    <br>You don't know what they have written but they keep sending it.
    <br>They are first-class beggars inside the church,
    <br>disturbing others that are here for the salvation of their souls.
    <br>It must be reported.
    <br>If this is in order, the world will be at its best, at peace.
    <br>You have to take this home.
    <br>Reporting should be an expression of believing.
    <br>Because you believe in what you are doing, you report.
    <br>Because you do not believe in what you are doing, you don't report.
    <br>You are here today; you have seen.
    <br>Your duty is to tell the world what you have seen!
    <br>Take time.
    <br>You can even move from one country to another -
    <br>"I just want to share what I have seen." You must be a good giver.
    <br>You are saved to save others.
    <br>You move, you take your time, any time you are back to your country.
    <br>Just take your time; you can fly from one city to another,
    <br>just to share what you have seen today with others.
    <br>Be a good reporter - first to God, then to men.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.

    <br>Don't forget the summary of the message:
    <br>Every establishment, company, ministry expects two things from you -
    <br>work and report.
    <br>You are going now.
    <br>Think of the report you have before you leave.
    <br>You have to look at whatever that is not right -
    <br>you are to report it.
    <br>In your company, everywhere.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are looking for perfection, go to Heaven.
    <br>That is why there is need for report.
    <br>You need to go to Heaven to see perfection.

    <br>Again.
