    314 HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    Today, we take this title:
    <br>OVERCOME YOUR DOUBT
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>This is what everyone is wrestling, battling, struggling with - doubt.
    <br>The best saints have need for the help that can make their faith stronger.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The best saints have need for the help that can make their faith stronger".
    <br>Who are you then, if the best saints...?
    <br>Let's take our reading from the Book of Matthew 11.
    <br>"Now it came to pass, when Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples
    <br>that He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
    <br>And when John had heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
    <br>and said to Him, 'Are you the Coming One, or do we look for another?'
    <br>Jesus answered and said to them,
    <br>'Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
    <br>The blind see and the lame walk;
    <br>the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear;
    <br>the dead are raised up
    <br>and the poor have the Gospel preached to them.
    <br>And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me'."
    <br>When you begin to look at all the Biblical characters...
    <br>Take the case of Abraham in Genesis 15:6.
    <br>Abraham believed but still he wanted a sign.
    <br>He wanted a sign that would make his faith stronger.
    <br>Let's look at Gideon in Judges 6:36-37.
    <br>Gideon believed but still he wanted a concrete sign to strengthen his faith.
    <br>Let someone say, "Overcome your doubt".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>John the Baptist;
    <br>in Matthew 11, John the Baptist believed but also wanted a concrete sign
    <br>to make his faith firm.
    <br>It's not that he did not believe; he believed.
    <br>He wanted concrete evidence, a concrete sign.
    <br>That was why he sent his two disciples there.
    <br>Many people in the Bible whom we regard, consider to be pillars of faith
    <br>had moments of doubt.
    <br>This does not mean that they had less faith
    <br>but their faith was being challenged in a new way.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>What do I mean by "hard moment of doubt"?
    <br>There were situations in their lives that challenged their faith,
    <br>uncommon, unusual things that they came across.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>If you are genuinely seeking salvation from God in the midst of doubt,
    <br>God will not mind because at the end, your doubt will move you closer to Him.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>Where do we go from here
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>How do we continue to live
    <br>Our life the same
    <br>Tell me how do we try to explain
    <br>This experience
    <br>That we have right here
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>Tell me where do we go from here
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>There were situations in their lives that challenged their faith,
    <br>unusual things that they came across.
    <br>There are situations in your life that are challenging your faith.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>What are the situations in your life that are challenging your faith?
    <br>Let such situation move you closer to God, not farther away from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let such situation move you closer to God, not farther away from Him".
    <br>Some would say, "No, I'm poor. No, I'm sick..." - no!
    <br>In cases of prolonged uncomfortable situations
    <br>such as sickness, disease, hardship, poverty and the like,
    <br>one seems to be tempted to doubt His ability and desire to help.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>One seems to be tempted to doubt His ability and desire to help.
    <br>"I have been in the sickness for many years. I have been a Christian for long...",
    <br>and you have friends that are churchgoers, but you - you are a doer.
    <br>Their faith was being challenged in a new way.
    <br>What one has not experienced before in one's life cropping up,
    <br>would generate anxiety, worry, panic and doubt in one's faith.
    <br>... what you have never experienced before.
    <br>You begin to ask yourself, "How does this thing come in? What is happening to me?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Overcome your doubt".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Yes, overcome your doubt.
    <br>When you open the Book of Matthew 14:31 -
    <br>David, John the Baptist and Peter
    <br>along with many other Biblical heroes struggled with various doubts.
    <br>When Peter was asked to drop his net, he said, "Jesus, I have been there for many...
    <br>I have been doing what You asked me to do. Why do you ask me to drop my net?"
    <br>No!
    <br>God does not mind doubt as long as we are seeking answer from God in the midst of it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God does not mind doubt as long as we are seeking answer from God
    <br>in the midst of it".
    <br>Yes, God does not mind doubt.
    <br>But mind you:
    <br>Doubt can become sin if it leads you away from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Doubt can become sin if it leads you away from God
    <br>to scepticism, cynicism and then to hard-heartedness.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>Doubt can become sin if it leads you away from God.
    <br>God does not mind doubt as long as we are seeking answer from Him
    <br>in the midst of it, like John the Baptist or Peter.
    <br>Why should I feel discouraged
    <br>Why must a shadow come
    <br>Why should my heart feel lonely
    <br>And long for Heaven and home
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>As you move closer to God, you will find the strength to trust God.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>As you move closer to Him,
    <br>in the midst of that doubt because you have a genuine desire;
    <br>you will find the strength to trust Him and your faith will grow even stronger!
    <br>One of satan's tactics is to get you to doubt God's goodness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "One of satan's tactics is to get you to doubt God's goodness".
    <br>God's time is the best; be patient!
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>He tries to get you to forget all God has given you
    <br>and he wants you to focus on what you do not have.
    <br>You begin to say, "God, give me..."
    <br>He wants you to focus on what you do not have.
    <br>If you are spending much of your time thinking about what you do not have,
    <br>you may be slipping into unhealthy doubt.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>Today, we only acknowledge the immediate goodness of God when we receive
    <br>and thereafter, never mention that miracle, that blessing,
    <br>that healing, that deliverance.
    <br>That is satan.
    <br>Remember the sickness you had in the past.
    <br>The same sickness others had and died
    <br>while many others are still on the sickbed.
    <br>If you say it was an ordinary sickness - because we have to answer to every question -
    <br>an ordinary headache, an ordinary heart attack,
    <br>people die of the same sickness every day.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Never doubt God's desire or ability to help you".
    <br>Let's quickly look at 1 Samuel 17:37.
    <br>It is just about a rustic boy - David.
    <br>David was brought to the king to defend his cause.
    <br>The Bible says he simply testified of how God had delivered him,
    <br>how God saved him, how God rescued him
    <br>from the mouth of the lion and bear in his tender age.
    <br>But you, if you are called for testimony,
    <br>you will mention just only the immediate day after,
    <br>you will never mention that miracle, blessing God did in your tender age.
    <br>God gives everyone plenty of evidence to believe in Him.
    <br>Let someone say, "God gives everyone plenty of evidence to believe in Him."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Doubt comes when we fail to stop long enough to observe all the evidence.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Listen again.
    <br>Doubt comes when we fail to stop long enough to observe all the evidence.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>Once in a while, you should take time to reflect
    <br>over God's track record in your life.
    <br>This is what I mean.
    <br>Many of us here today were born into poverty-stricken families.
    <br>"Stricken" means - your uncle and grandmother are poor,
    <br>no vehicle, no motorcycle, even no house; everybody is living in the family house.
    <br>Many of us were born into poverty-stricken families,
    <br>sickness-ridden families.
    <br>But today, we are able to live above all that.
    <br>We are like a man who prayed that he had no shoes.
    <br>At last, God answered and he had money.
    <br>He went to the market and saw a man without legs.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you have doubt, review God's track record in your life".
    <br>When you have doubt, review God's track record in your life.
    <br>You would know that you are from nowhere to somebody.
    <br>Review it - God's track record in your life.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>When you take your time to review God's track record in your life,
    <br>that will grow confidence that He will work in your present situation.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>When you are struggling with doubt, take time to remember
    <br>the way God has worked in your life.
    <br>As you recall God's track record, you will grow confident
    <br>that the situation you are in is not like others' but for the glory of God.
    <br>As you recall God's track record, you will grow confident
    <br>that whatever situation you are in, going by the track record...
    <br>Look at me here.
    <br>I spent 20 something months in my mother's womb.
    <br>Why was I not delivered at the ninth month?
    <br>For me to be there for 20 something months and nothing happened to me and I was delivered,
    <br>the seventh day after I was delivered, a stone came from nowhere to hit me and kill me
    <br>but I escaped this.
    <br>Going by my track record in the past - wow!
    <br>Each time I take time to remember the way God has worked in my life,
    <br>as I recall God's track record, it grows confidence in me
    <br>that whatever happens, it's not like others' but for the glory of God.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>As you recall God's track record in your life, it will grow confidence
    <br>that a solution is forthcoming.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>You will grow confident that your present situation will be overcome by God
    <br>as He did in the past.
    <br>You will grow confident that God will never fail or abandon you
    <br>because He has not and never did in the past.
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME DOUBT: Life-Changing Sermon With T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be patient".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Be patient and let God answer your questions on His schedule, not yours.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Be patient and let God answer your questions on His schedule, not yours.]
    <br>Be patient and let God answer your questions on His schedule, not yours.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>At God's time, it is all good!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Rise up.

    <br>So, doubt can move one closer to God.
    <br>If I genuinely seek salvation from God in the midst of doubt,
    <br>God will not mind because at the end, my doubt will move me closer to Him.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.

    <br>God is aware that there are some challenges,
    <br>prolonged, uncomfortable situations.
    <br>One seems to be tempted to doubt God's desire or ability to help.
    <br>God is aware.
    <br>Father, thank You.
