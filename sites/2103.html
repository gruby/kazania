    <br>THE NEW ANOINTING WATER
    <br>HOW TO USE THE NEW ANOINTING WATER
    <br>With this precious gift, you can reach out to your loved ones anywhere they are all around the world
    <br>without going there or touching them.
    <br>Just take your phone, your laptop or any other mobile device and give a call to your loved ones on the sickbed.
    <br>Ask them to turn on their camera so that you can see them, and they can see you.
    <br>Now it is time to spray this new Anointing Water
    <br>Ask your loved ones to ask for God's mercy and forgiveness.
    <br>After that, you can pray.
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be delivered, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be rescued, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Take note:
    <br>Whilst spraying the new Anointing Water, you must have a good motive, a good intention.
    <br>That is all you need - a good motive for salvation - before you start spraying.
    <br>And the person receiving must also have a good intention for the salvation of their soul,
    <br>so they can maintain the miracle they are about to receive.
    <br>Remember, any time you make such a call, make sure you have a video record.
    <br>This is for the glory of God.
    <br>We look forward to receiving your testimonies.
    <br>This is what you are about to see.
    <br>Stay in faith.
    <br>All this is because of social distancing.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>Emmanuel! God with us.
    <br>Because of social distancing, let us bring healing, let us bring deliverance,
    <br>let us bring cure to our loved ones, without going there or touching them.
    <br>God can use any medium to express Himself.
    <br>Never a sickness, never an affliction it cannot heal in Jesus' name!
    <br>Never a problem it cannot solve in Jesus' name!
    <br>Never a burden it cannot bear in Jesus' name!
    <br>THE NEW ANOINTING WATER
    <br>My name is Fanny; I am from Germany.
    <br>To my side is my husband Benjamin.
    <br>He has a spinal problem and is using a lumbar corset.
    <br>Because of this problem and also because of piles, he cannot lie on his back, and he always bleeds.
    <br>These are the medical reports of my husband.
    <br>This is a picture of my husband when he was in hospital because of his spinal problem.
    <br>We want the Lord to touch and heal him.
    <br>My name is Benjamin. I am from Mexico, but I live in Germany.
    <br>I am using a lumbar corset because I cannot walk.
    <br>I am a physiotherapist by profession.
    <br>I cannot do anything and I cannot work.
    <br>I would like the Lord Jesus Christ to heal me.
    <br>THE NEW ANOINTING WATER
    <br>Here is the new Anointing Water for you.
    <br>Never a sickness, never an affliction it cannot heal in Jesus' name!
    <br>You are destined to be healed today in Jesus' name!
    <br>With just a mere spray, the anointing of God inside this bottle will bring about the cure in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Be free of any wrong, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be free of any sin, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be delivered, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be free from that sickness and affliction, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be rescued, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Remember, this man is from Germany, but distance is not a barrier.
    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Rise up from your bed of sickness
    <br>because the Lord has set you free through the medium of this new Anointing Water.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Open your mouth to receive a touch of this new Anointing Water.
    <br>Be free of any sickness in your body, be delivered, be rescued, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Healed Of A Spinal Problem And Piles
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset
    <br>This is the lumbar corset my husband was using, but now he is free to the glory of God.
    <br>He does not need it anymore. We are going to throw it away in the garbage!
    <br>We are free, healed, delivered and blessed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Healed Of A Spinal Problem And Piles
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset
    <br>I don't feel any pain and I can sit down!
    <br>Before, I could only sleep like this, but now I don't feel any pain and I can lie on my back.
    <br>Now, I can get up very quickly.
    <br>Now I can walk normally and do exercise.
    <br>It was difficult for me to do this before, but now I can do this exercise.
    <br>Healed Of A Spinal Problem And Piles
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset
    <br>The moment the evangelist ministered the Anointing Water, I felt a hot sensation in my body -
    <br>in my stomach, back and shoulders - and I don't feel any pain now.
    <br>I feel very good!
    <br>THE NEW ANOINTING WATER
    <br>This is my phone.
    <br>If you receive this new Anointing Water genuinely, you too can take your phone or laptop
    <br>and call your loved ones on the sickbed through a video call and pray with them.
    <br>My advice to viewers around the world is: Whatever sickness or disease you have,
    <br>you can spray this new Anointing Water through your phone on your loved ones
    <br>just as the Emmanuel TV Team sprayed on me, and you will get healed.
    <br>You don't need to be anointed to do this because the bottle is anointed already. Anyone can do this.
    <br>Make sure you get the new Anointing Water in a genuine way.
    <br>How you get it and the motive behind how you get it determines the healing and deliverance in it.
    <br>The Bible says, "Freely we receive; freely we give."
    <br>Don't let anyone deceive you.
    <br>The shipping to get the Anointing Water to you is free.
    <br>The Anointing Water itself is free!
    <br>What else will you pay for?
    <br>No effort to get it should be paid for; that is why it is anointed.
    <br>Anything paid to get it, either the Anointing Water itself or the shipping, means it is no longer anointed.
    <br>Freely we receive; freely we give.
    <br>Don't be duped, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Don't forget to record and send us the testimonies of what happens when you minister the new Anointing Water!
    <br>Emmanuel. God with us.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>My name is Aisha. I live in the UK.
    <br>I am working as a healthcare assistant, as well as a student nurse.
    <br>I was attending to patients when I contracted the virus.
    <br>It has caused me a lot of difficulty in breathing.
    <br>I always experience fever and headaches.
    <br>It's hard to do anything. When I'm walking up the stairs, I get so tired and feel like I can't breathe anymore.
    <br>I always have body pain and cannot do anything by myself.
    <br>This is my medical report from the National Healthcare Service in the UK,
    <br>which confirms that I am this virus positive.
    <br>I believe the Lord Jesus Christ will heal me.
    <br>With just a mere spray, the anointing of God inside this bottle will bring the cure to your life, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Right now, be free of every wrong, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be free of any wrong, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be free of any sin, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Whatever virus in your system, be flushed out in Jesus' name!
    <br>Vomit out that virus from your system, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Whatever is not of God in your system, whatever affliction of virus in your system, in your organs,
    <br>be free in Jesus' name!
    <br>Anything that is not of God, that virus that has afflicted your system, vomit it out in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever is not of God will be flushed out of your system
    <br>through the medium of this new Anointing Water, in Jesus' name.
    <br>This person is far away in the UK, but distance is not a barrier to the move of God.
    <br>Be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be set free, in Jesus name!
    <br>Remember that this person is far away in the United Kingdom,
    <br>and just a mere spray of this new Anointing Water from Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>You can see what is happening in her life.
    <br>Every atom of the virus has been flushed out, and we can see what she has vomited.
    <br>So, right now, you are free, you are delivered and you are set free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Rise up on your feet and share with us your testimony of what God has done in your life.
    <br>Even in my chest, I don't feel something holding me. I am relieved. I can breathe very well.
    <br>I started reacting and felt like the demons were reacting in my body.
    <br>My vomiting shows that distance is no barrier.
    <br>I am a new person! Even the way I speak now is different!
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV, for this new Anointing Water.
    <br>THE NEW ANOINTING WATER TESTIMONY
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>By the grace of God, while watching
    <br>I saw there was a new Anointing Water which was released by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I live in the UK and contracted the virus while attending to some patients.
    <br>I contacted Emmanuel TV and was prayed for through a video call.
    <br>I got my healing; I can breathe very well!
    <br>Before, breathing was so hard, and I was always short of breath.
    <br>Sleeping at night was so hard.
    <br>Walking up the stairs was so hard because I would gasp for air, but now I can do everything!
    <br>My shoulders were painful, but now they are no longer painful. I can shake them very well!
    <br>I am so happy! I feel joy in my heart!
    <br>I advise anyone who has the new Anointing Water - you can do the same as was done to me.
    <br>You can call your loved ones wherever they are - whether they are on the sickbed or in the hospital -
    <br>and minister this Anointing Water just as it was ministered to me.
    <br>I am free now! I can breathe very well!
    <br>Please, try to get this Anointing Water, but it is not for sale.
    <br>People should not deceive you to sell it. It is not for sale; it is free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The Bible says, "Freely we receive; freely we give."
    <br>Don't let anyone deceive you.
    <br>The shipping to get the Anointing Water to you is free.
    <br>The Anointing Water itself is free!
    <br>What else will you pay for?
    <br>No effort to get it should be paid for; that is why it is anointed.
    <br>Anything paid to get it, either the Anointing Water itself or the shipping, means it is no longer anointed.
    <br>Freely we receive; freely we give.
    <br>Don't be duped, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Don't forget to record and send us the testimonies of what happens when you minister the new Anointing Water!
    <br>Emmanuel. God with us.
    <br>Happy New Year!
