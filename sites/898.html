  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>I hope you are thanking Jesus in your hearts.
    <br>Nowadays, we have substitutes - 
    <br>belief for action - which is wrong.
    <br>When we see people saying, "I believe in healing. 
    <br>I believe in salvation. I believe in this, that..." -
    <br>It is not enough to believe in healing.
    <br>It is not enough to just believe in healing, 
    <br>or whatever you are seeking.
    <br>It is something we must reach out, in faith.
    <br>That is why many times we get disappointed.
    <br>"I believe, I believe..."
    <br>Many of you are here because you believe 
    <br>but you must reach out in faith.
    <br>That is, we must speak our faith and act our faith.
    <br>Not just speak, "Yes..."
    <br>It must be from your heart.
    <br>If you want to demonstrate that 'Yes', 
    <br>it must also be from your heart.
    <br>I should not just come out because I believe; 
    <br>I must come out because I have faith.
    <br>If you say you believe, Jesus will work for you
    <br> – belief in our heart is released by faith -
    <br>how will that belief be released?
    <br>The belief in our heart can only be 
    <br>released by faith out of our mouth.
    <br>“I believe Jesus will work for me.”
    <br>Where is your faith?
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>If you believe, where is your faith?
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>If you believe Jesus will heal you, 
    <br>you should also reach out in faith;
    <br>you must have the work of faith in that matter.
    <br>"I'm having a headache. I believe Jesus will heal me."
    <br>If I really believe Jesus will heal me,
    <br> I must reach out in faith to Jesus.
    <br>How do we reach out in faith?
    <br>With that headache I should
    <br> not be distressed, or worried.
    <br>I should not be worried.
    <br>People should greet me;
    <br> I should be able to say, "How are you?"
    <br>"Fine."
    <br>I should not look sad; that means
    <br>I've reached out in faith.
    <br>Today, we say, "I believe Jesus will heal me", 
    <br>but you are still worried, distressed, in anxiety,
    <br>and you say you believe Jesus will heal you.
    <br>Where is your work of faith?
    <br>That means your faith is fake.
    <br>You are expecting money from someone; 
    <br>you don't have money -
    <br>somebody promised you and you 
    <br>believe in God that the man will pay.
    <br>At that moment you should begin to be happy, even begin to look for what you want to buy with this money,
    <br>even reach out to the market saying, 
    <br>"How much is this? 10 dollars, 20 dollars..."
    <br>You have not received that money, but you tell them,
    <br> "I'm coming back. Will you be here? tomorrow?
    <br>I will be here tomorrow. I'm coming back."
    <br>It means you have reached out in faith.
    <br>It is not the situation, where you say, you 
    <br>believe that the man will pay you the money
    <br>but you are still at home, worrying, thinking, 
    <br>"What if the man will not pay me? What will I do?"
    <br>You are worried as if you have never prayed at all.
    <br>I hope you know the work of faith now.
    <br>It is not enough to believe.
    <br>Today, we have substituted belief for action.
    <br>We should not substitute belief for action.
    <br>‘Action’ is still there because belief is released by faith.
    <br>You must speak your faith and act 
    <br>your faith to activate God’s power.
    <br>You cannot activate God’s power without 
    <br>speaking words of faith and acting faith.
    <br>'Fake people' can say, "I believe".
    <br>If you are not genuine, you can hide under 'belief'.
    <br>You say, "I believe Jesus. I'm a believer." - fake people.
    <br>Those who are not genuine,
    <br>"I'm a believer. I'm born-again."
    <br>If you believe, you should have the 
    <br>work of faith in that matter.
    <br>"I believe. Jesus will heal me." - your faith should change immediately, if you have work of faith.
    <br>Smile!
    <br>Greet people around you as if you don't have pain.
    <br>Give a phone call to people, "How are you?"
    <br>Don't look sad, greet.
    <br>If someone around you needs help,
    <br> give out: "What do you need?"
    <br>That's belief; the job is done.
    <br>Healing is something, deliverance is 
    <br>something, salvation is something;
    <br>we must reach out in faith.
    <br>Speak your faith and act your
    <br>faith to activate God’s power.
    <br>Like you are sitting now; if you are really here and you believe God - God will work for you today -
    <br>you begin to be happy.
    <br>When that healing has not happened, begin to be happy.
    <br>Show your joy.
    <br>Smile.
    <br>Help people, as if you are giving testimony; 
    <br>that is work of faith.
    <br>Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised to do.
    <br>Remember father Abraham.
    <br>God is not a man that lies.
    <br>He said He will do it and He will do it.
    <br>If the Son says He will do it, He will do it.
    <br>But if your friend says he will do it, he may not do it.
    <br>If your father says he will do it, he may not do it.
    <br>If your mummy says she will do it, she may not do it but if the Son says He will do it, He will do it indeed!
    <br>That is the work of faith.
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>You must always show your faith when you believe.
    <br>It goes together: faith – belief, 
    <br>just like prayer and Bible reading;
    <br>one is not complete without the other.
    <br>Belief and faith should always go together; 
    <br>one is not complete without the other.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together;
    <br>one is not complete without the other.
    <br>In the same vein, belief and faith should always go together; one is not complete without the other.
    <br>If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>If you say you believe, you must have the work of faith.
    <br>Faith releases belief in our heart
    <br>just as a key opens the locked door.
    <br>Put the key - it will open.
    <br>Faith releases belief in our heart.
    <br>No faith – your belief would be dormant in your heart.
    <br>That is why when you speak, 
    <br>you speak the word of faith;
    <br>act faith to activate God’s power.
    <br>There are two things you noticed today.
    <br>One: prayer and Bible reading 
    <br>should always go together,
    <br>but you on your own - you always pray, 
    <br>without reading Bible.
    <br>Where do you get the Word?
    <br>The Word you use in prayer is the 
    <br>Word of God, not your word.
    <br>The Word you use, "Father, help me..."
    <br>There are two "help" - the language of your own help, and the language of the Bible.
    <br>"Come!" - there are two "come".
    <br>Man has the ability to come; 
    <br>the Holy Spirit comes as He wills.
    <br>It means man has the word, ‘Come’; the
    <br> Holy Spirit also has His own Word, ‘Come’.
    <br>"Good Morning" - there are two "Good Morning".
    <br>Man has the ability to say, “Good Morning”; the Holy Spirit of God also says, “Good Morning”.
    <br>Which one are you using, when you are 
    <br>not reading your Bible before praying?
    <br>There are two "walk" - see me.
    <br>Man has the ability to walk, Holy Spirit walks.
    <br>Who is walking here now?
    <br>Look at me - who is walking?
    <br>You don't know - that is the problem.
    <br>Because you look with man's eyes, 
    <br>not the eyes of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So, you don't know who is walking here.
    <br>That's why you can blaspheme, 
    <br>speak against, do anything.
    <br>An evil thought in your heart, "Look at him, 
    <br>see the way he walks..."
    <br>You don't even know who is walking.
    <br>See - who is walking here?
    <br>You don't know.
    <br>Because you can only know who is walking, 
    <br>when you look with the eyes of faith.
    <br>That is, when the Holy Spirit looks through
    <br> you, you know who is walking.
    <br>If you look, you see a man, but if your look
    <br>is a look of the Holy Spirit, you see God's being.
    <br>That's the problem.
    <br>When it comes to the things of the 
    <br>Spirit in this world, there is a problem.
    <br>If God comes today, He will only show
    <br>mercy of taking you to the Kingdom;
    <br>by His mercy you will go to His Kingdom.
    <br>You cannot see Him, talk to Him, relate
    <br> with Him - how will you live for Him?
    <br>If today is our last day on earth, those of us
    <br>that will go, will go by His highly mercy.
    <br>Not because you live for Him.
    <br>How will you live for Someone you don't relate with?
    <br>How can you live for Someone you 
    <br>cannot even interact with?
    <br>You don't know when He is talking, 
    <br>how He is talking...
    <br>You cannot tell me how you relate with your God.
    <br>That is a big problem, when it 
    <br>comes to things of the Spirit.
    <br>It is very disappointing; after you have 
    <br>finished your Bible, three times, four times,
    <br>from Genesis to Revelation, you can preach
    <br> any verses, even you can write the Bible,
    <br>yet - you don't know God.
    <br>Very disappointing.
    <br>When we are talking of knowing God, there are simple 
    <br>ways to start from, instead of deceiving ourselves.
    <br>"Yes, I have the Word, I've studied the Word..."
    <br>This Word of God, the Bible is the 
    <br>letter inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>If it is a letter inspired by the Holy Spirit of God, it means the thought of it is from the Spirit of God.
    <br>Now, it is the Spirit of God that we should know.
    <br>How do we know Him?
    <br>By having a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that is not locked up by sin.
    <br>What are those things?
    <br>Holding grudges, envy, jealousy, pain of the past.
    <br>These are sins.
    <br>"Somebody has cheated me, embarrassed me" - grieve, grudges, envy, strive, unforgiving spirit - these are sins.
    <br>You cannot have a free spirit when
    <br> you are locked up by sin.
    <br>These are the fruits of the sin.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that is not locked up by sin.
    <br>What are the sins?
    <br>Envy, jealousy, pain of the past, unforgiving
    <br> spirit, just name them – these are sins.
    <br>When those things lock up your spirit, 
    <br>your spirit can never be free.
    <br>A free spirit is sensitive to the Spirit
    <br> of God and if a spirit is locked up by sin,
    <br>it cannot be sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>You want to go for God, you love God - it is not possible,
    <br>because you are locked, you are in the prison.
    <br>The human spirit, when free, is sensitive
    <br> to the Spirit of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The human spirit, when free,
    <br> is sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>If it is bound or burdened, it loses that sensitivity.
    <br>When it loses that sensitivity, what else again?
    <br>Therefore, it is useless as an instrument.
    <br>Many of our spirits are useless.
    <br>The purpose of your spirit is to attract that Spirit of God
    <br>but it’s useless because it’s locked up 
    <br>by envy, jealousy, anger, pain of the past.
    <br>The purpose of your spirit is to attract God, 
    <br>work with God, marry God and admire God.
    <br>"This is God!" - Everywhere, anything of God because He is your Creator!
    <br>You want to admire Him, you want to marry Him, you want to walk with Him,
    <br>but it is useless now because of envy, jealousy - you can think of all those things that locked up your spirit.
    <br>Let someone say, "Free spirit".
    <br>The human spirit, when free, 
    <br>is sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>That is, your spirit when free is sensitive, 
    <br>it attracts, it marries, it loves God.
    <br>If you say you love God, when your 
    <br>spirit is locked, you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>I can see now the reason why we are trying to love God, we try to follow God, we say we love God.
    <br>When there is prayer, you see people
    <br>crying, "Oh, my God..."
    <br>He is trying to love God.
    <br>No way.
    <br>It is better to know your problem than not.
    <br>"This is my problem - OK"; you continue to battle with it.
    <br>"This is my problem. I don't know; I thought I knew the Bible."
    <br>"Oh! This is my problem. My spirit is locked up."
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>This is my problem.
    <br>My spirit is locked up.
    <br>This is my story this is my song
    <br>Praising my Saviour all the day long
    <br>You don't have a problem.
    <br>The only problem you have is
    <br>that your spirit is locked up.
    <br>"My spirit is locked up."
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you agree with me, let me see your hand.
    <br>Please, if you agree with me, 
    <br>raise up your hand that you agree.
    <br>All this, Genesis, this, that - stop that.
    <br>Your spirit is locked up.
    <br>How to open it?
    <br>How to be free and become an instrument?
    <br>That is what we have to talk about now.
    <br>Your spirit is locked up.
    <br>Envy, jealousy, anger, all this, is an instrument that locks my spirit.
    <br>If my spirit is not free, it can never be sensitive to the Spirit of God; it will lose that sensitivity.
    <br>This is nail and magnet; if you bring them...
    <br>But when your spirit is locked up, it can't magnetize.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>You can see the reason why I don't reply critics.
    <br>They say this, that; I will remain silent, because I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will never hear me standing here and 
    <br>criticizing ministers of God, or any church,
    <br>that they are this, that  - 
    <br>I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I will not stand on Emmanuel TV and say, "Hey, miracle - come to The Synagogue and worship".
    <br>No.
    <br>Does it mean other churches are not good?
    <br>I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are coming from the airport, you are supposed to see Synagogue sign boards everywhere.
    <br>No, we don't have any sign boards, no sign posts.
    <br>This is not the only living church; 
    <br>there are other living churches.
    <br>I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When I wake up in the morning and I'm coming to the service, they will put all the dresses, suits, fine ones.
    <br>I say, "No no no. Just give me a simple one.
    <br>Remember, they are here to see Prophet T.B. Joshua, not Mr T.B. Joshua".
    <br>If you pay much attention on Mr T.B. Joshua,
    <br>it becomes a sin.
    <br>It is Mr T.B. Joshua that puts on the dress.
    <br>If Mr T.B. Joshua dresses 
    <br>gorgeously and says, "Hello, hi..."
    <br>and you are sitting down and begin to count, 
    <br>"How much are those shoes?
    <br>How much is this dress? Look at him! Oh my God!"
    <br>It becomes a sin and it will lock up my spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Criticizing, abusing, jealousy, envy...
    <br>You hear something you don't want to hear...
    <br>It is what you want hear, you will hear.
    <br>If people know that you are on the side of God - what is pure, clean, admirable,
    <br>is all what you want to hear - those things will be coming to you.
    <br>But if it is what is condemning, destroying, criticizing, killing, destroying, stealing is what you want to hear,
    <br>those things will be coming to you, to destroy
    <br>your spirit and to lock up your spirit.
    <br>I have been praying for you to know better.
    <br>When you are rebuking me, banning me, 
    <br>praying against me, I keep praying for you,
    <br>because I don't want anything to lock up my spirit.
    <br>Because my spirit is an instrument to 
    <br>attract God's Spirit, to walk with God's Spirit.
    <br>If the spirit were locked, you would not be
    <br>able to come here today.
    <br>All what we are seeing happening in
    <br> the life of T.B. Joshua would not happen.
    <br>It is because my spirit is sensitive, 
    <br>attracting God's Spirit,
    <br>that is why you see miracle, deliverance, 
    <br>all this happen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don’t need to be perfect to be used
    <br>by God but you need to be available.
    <br>You are available, when you do away with 
    <br>those things and allow your spirit to be free.
    <br>Something may have happened to you 
    <br>yesterday - put it behind you.
    <br>I’m married to Jesus
    <br>Satan leave me alone
    <br>My husband is coming to take me away
    <br>To everlasting home
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>I'm married to what?
    <br>Jesus.
    <br>I’m married to love
    <br>Hatred leave me alone
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I’m married to faithfulness 
    <br>Unfaithfulness leave me alone
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the meaning.
    <br>Their nature is what the Bible is talking 
    <br>about; the nature of satan - leave me,
    <br>the nature of God - I'm married with You.
    <br>I'm married to goodness; bad - leave me alone.
    <br>I'm married to faithfulness; unfaithfulness, 
    <br>leave me alone.
    <br>I'm married to humility; pride - leave me alone.
    <br>I'm married to love, hatred - leave me alone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is it.
    <br>But in your own case, you think marrying to Jesus...
    <br>- where will you see Jesus to marry?
    <br>You can only get married to His nature.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Where will you see Him?
    <br>You can only get married to His nature.
    <br>I cannot hear you; stand up!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where will you see Him to do wedding?
    <br>You can only wed who?
    <br>His nature, faithfulness, kindness, 
    <br>goodness, humility, love!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can only marry His nature.
    <br>He is talking about His nature.
    <br>His nature - when you know that, 
    <br>you know how to live your life.
    <br>Leave me unfaithfulness, I'm married with faithfulness.
    <br>Leave me disobedience, I'm married with obedience.
    <br>That is what we are talking about.
    <br>Viewers, thank you.
