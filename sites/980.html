    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Tendani Nematandani.
    <br>I'm from South Africa.
    <br>The reason that made me come to The SCOAN was barrenness for 15 years.
    <br>In 2013, I came to The SCOAN because of barrenness due to my husband's low sperm count.
    <br>The doctors had told us that our chances were very slim for me to fall pregnant.
    <br>There was no way medically that I could fall pregnant.
    <br>They even suggested that I could either do artificial insemination or IVF.
    <br>They gave me the prices of doing IVF and indicated that you can do it up to five times
    <br>and not have a baby.
    <br>When they gave me the prices, it was around 50,000 Rands each.
    <br>If it failed, it meant I was going to pay another 50,000 Rands to do another artifical insemination.
    <br>I went back home with my husband, we sat down and decided,
    <br>"Let's seek the face of God; let's go to The SCOAN".
    <br>Even when we came here, some family friends asked if it could be true that I would fall pregnant.
    <br>Before coming here, tell us what you experienced and how your husband felt,
    <br>knowing that it was because he had low sperm count that you couldn't conceive a child.
    <br>That was a very difficult situation.
    <br>The pain that I endured was so much in such a way that every month,
    <br>instead of, as a woman, being happy when I saw my menstruation,
    <br>for me it was pain because when I saw menstruation, it meant I was not pregnant.
    <br>When people invited me for baby showers and birthdays for the kids,
    <br>I would sit down and think about whether I should go or not.
    <br>When I saw other women talking about children, sometimes I felt that they were talking about me.
    <br>Some people used to confront me to ask how many children I had.
    <br>That is painful if you know you don't have a child and the person is asking you
    <br>how many children you have and how many years you have been married.
    <br>That was so painful.
    <br>I didn't want anyone to ask me about a child or when I was married
    <br>because to me that was a pain in my life.
    <br>I went to different avenues to find a solution but I couldn't find a solution.
    <br>I would sit down and cry alone because I could not take the pain.
    <br>The way it was, there were some times that I felt it was better to leave my marriage.
    <br>Just go without saying anything because I felt like I was an embarrassment.
    <br>My family members would even talk behind my back.
    <br>The experience of not having a child as a woman was so painful.
    <br>So how did you finally hear about The SCOAN and decided to come?
    <br>The other day, I decided to scroll the public channels.
    <br>As I was scrolling, I found Emmanuel TV.
    <br>There was a lady in a passage giving birth within five minutes
    <br>because she was overdue - ten months and when I saw that, I was so surprised.
    <br>I said to myself, "Wow! Is this really happening? Where is this place?"
    <br>I started watching and when my husband came back,
    <br>I told him, "I saw a miracle today! I saw a woman giving birth".
    <br>Then, from there, I started following Emmanuel TV until I found out how to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I came with my husband.
    <br>The man of God prayed for us.
    <br>After praying, he said, "It is well".
    <br>We were also opportune to be given the Morning Water.
    <br>When we went back home to South Africa, as I kept on ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>From there, my menstruation started to be very heavy with lots of big fluids.
    <br>I couldn't understand what was going on but I kept on holding to the Word of God - "It is well".
    <br>For five months, my system was being cleaned because as time went on,
    <br>my menstruation became normal again.
    <br>After ministering Morning Water, we met as husband and wife and after meeting,
    <br>I went to work the next day.
    <br>I started vomiting.
    <br>When I started vomiting, my mind was not yet there.
    <br>When a colleague said, "You are pregnant", I said, "That is impossible; I am not pregnant".
    <br>I couldn't believe it myself.
    <br>I went to the chemist and bought a home pregnancy test.
    <br>Then, I did the pregnancy test.
    <br>I was so shocked when I saw the two red colours.
    <br>I started jumping, saying, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That meant that I was pregnant.
    <br>I was so excited that I didn't know what to do.
    <br>I thanked God, sang, praised God and said, "God, You are a wonderful God!
    <br>You never fail us and even me, You remembered me at Your time".
    <br>While Mrs Nemantandani was several months pregnant,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV Team caught up with her and her husband in South Africa.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nematandani
    <br>Pregnancy Testimony
    <br>As you heard my wife saying, I think she said it all.
    <br>What I am happy about is that God's time is the best.
    <br>We waited so long for this time to happen and here it is.
    <br>I only praise God for what has happened.
    <br>A few weeks later, the Emmanuel TV Team visited Mrs Nemantandani and her husband at the hospital after her delivery.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Visit Mr & Mrs
    <br>Nematandani In Hospital After Her Delivery
    <br>A few weeks later, the Emmanuel TV Team visited Mrs Nemantandani in hospital after her delivery.
    <br>After nine months of pregnancy, I gave birth to a baby girl on the third of May.
    <br>Her name means 'Light' as in Isaiah 61, "Arise and shine as the light has come upon you".
    <br>She will be three years old tomorrow.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus.
    <br>This was the joy that I didn't want to miss out in my life.
    <br>I want to be with her in each every step of the way.
    <br>Even if she cries, that is the joy of being a mother; I enjoy it.
    <br>This is the blessing - God has trusted me with this baby.
    <br>What I do is to ask God to give me wisdom to take care of this baby.
    <br>By myself, I can't. He trusted me after 15 years.
    <br>What I can say is do not concentrate on your situation.
    <br>Leave it for God; then, He will take care of your situation as He did for me.
    <br>Amen. And we know there are many of us here that have been listening to your testimony.
    <br>And we know that we have few questions - one or two questions from the audience here.
    <br>Emmanuel! My name is Xolewa Meche from South Africa.
    <br>My question to madam at the front is for two categories of people.
    <br>I want to know the reaction from the people like your in-laws and the doctors
    <br>when they discovered that you were pregnant
    <br>What was their reaction and what was your response to them?
    <br>My family members couldn't believe it that I was pregnant.
    <br>Everyone was shocked and were busy phoning me to ask if it was real. I said, "Yes".
    <br>The doctor was so shocked, "How can you be pregnant
    <br>whereas we told you, you cannot be pregnant?"
    <br>The doctor was so shocked, also considering my age but I said, "It didn't matter.
    <br>The God who trusted me with this gift will take care of her".
    <br>Amen. Thank you.
    <br>My name is Kaba Mamba from Zambia.
    <br>I just wanted to find out - the years, they were too much, 15 years, and you were in such pain.
    <br>But I heard, if I got you correctly, you talked of after you had come with your husband
    <br>from here SCOAN, you stayed for almost six to seven months.
    <br>I wanted to find out: What was the reaction of your husband during that period?
    <br>My husband was still believing in God because he used to encourage me, saying,
    <br>"Tendani, let's focus on God.
    <br>We went to The SCOAN where things are happening; do not lose hope".
    <br>He kept on encouraging me even when he sensed that I was losing hope,
    <br>he kept on saying, "Let's focus on God and see what God can do for us".
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So finally, if there is anything you would like to say. Over to you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>What I can say is hold on to God and hold on to the promises of God.
    <br>In the Word of God , it is written that His Word will never change;
    <br>it will stay as it is.
    <br>If He said He will heal us, bless us, indeed He will. Amen.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Mrs Tendani Nematandani
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So the Bible itself asked the question, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?"
    <br>[No!]
    <br>So put your trust in Him.
    <br>Amen. It is well, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. It is well.
    <br>Now knowing that it is the Lord who has rescued and delivered you
    <br>and brought about you having this lovely girl in your hands today,
    <br>how are you going to raise and train her?
    <br>I am going to train her towards the way of God.
    <br>That was the reason I said to myself that I should take the baby back and give thanks to God
    <br>as I promised even before I fell pregnant.
    <br>I remember the day that I left The SCOAN, I was telling everyone
    <br>that I was coming back with a testimony and indeed, I have come back with a testimony.
    <br>It is well in the name of Jesus
    <br>It is well with my soul today
    <br>The listeners join Mrs Nematandani to praise the Lord Jesus.
    <br>A fitting conclusion to her wonderful testimony of how God has been with her all the way long
    <br>- through challenges and difficulties until she finally received the promise of God.
    <br>Visitors from around the world at The SCOAN, touched by her life experience,
    <br>came forward to see her baby girl and congratulate the joyful mother.
    <br>A few even posed to take a picture together as a reminder of the goodness of God.
    <br>To God be the glory!
