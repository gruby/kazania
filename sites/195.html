  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is John Bosco.
    <br>I'm from Cameroon.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of God in my life.
    <br>I am from a womb that has delivered 11 times and I am the eleventh child.
    <br>It is sad to say my other siblings are dead including my parents.
    <br>There came a time when I was still very young,
    <br>I was suffering from a dental problem and a neighbour advised me to take tobacco, that is snuff,
    <br>that if I put snuff there, it would solve the problem.
    <br>As I took it, I became drunk and started feeling dizzy.
    <br>The next day, I enjoyed the thing.
    <br>I started taking it until I became addicted to taking tobacco for 19 years.
    <br>I went to Ghana to carry out a crash programme in the Maritime University there.
    <br>I continued taking tobacco.
    <br>At night, I couldn't go to sleep without taking tobacco.
    <br>I would even wake up at 11 or 12 o'clock in the night
    <br>and pass through the graveyard because where I stay, there is a graveyard just by the side.
    <br>I would pass through it at 12 or 11 o'clock in the night.
    <br>I would go and knock that they should please sell me 'asala'
    <br>because in Ghana they call it 'asala' while here, we call it snuff.
    <br>I had been living a nasty life.
    <br>I clubbed, womanised and did certain things.
    <br>There came a day that I started vomiting blood; I became so sick until I was so lean.
    <br>I struggled from Ghana until I arrived to The SCOAN.
    <br>By the grace of God, I attended a church service on a certain Sunday.
    <br>Before then, it had been two months that I hadn't gone to the toilet as I was sick.
    <br>But I had been eating.
    <br>It was like the whole of my system had become blocked.
    <br>That Sunday service, during the end, as the mass prayer was going on,
    <br>it was as if I had received a very heavy slap on my stomach.
    <br>I bent with the pain then I became pressed.
    <br>I rushed to the toilet upstairs, I can remember very well.
    <br>I was passing out blood and faeces.
    <br>Thereafter, I went back.
    <br>By the grace of God, I had the Anointing Water with me.
    <br>On my way going back to where I passed the night, at the bus park on a carton.
    <br>I had a place where I usually passed the night on a carton on the floor.
    <br>After then, on my way back, I had my Anointing Water.
    <br>I could not find my Anointing Water when I wanted to use it on myself.
    <br>It had disappeared; I don't know how.
    <br>I just said to myself that God didn't want me to live anymore.
    <br>Somebody saw me at the back and took me to the hospital.
    <br>Then, I was being diagnosed of gastric ulcer - chronic gastric ulcer and tuberculosis.
    <br>They said this was what had brought about the blood I was vomiting.
    <br>I told the man that I was going back to Cameroon.
    <br>I pleaded with a motorbike rider who helped me by
    <br>providing me with an attachment seat until I got to Calabar.
    <br>I met a certain lady from The SCOAN.
    <br>She too is from Cameroon.
    <br>I pleaded with this lady that my destination was actually Cameroon
    <br>but that I had no money on me that would take me to Cameroon.
    <br>I said, "Please, help me and pay my fare.
    <br>When we arrive, I will call a friend who will give you the money."
    <br>The lady said I should give her that friend's number.
    <br>She called the friend and the friend confirmed.
    <br>Only then, I realised that the lady had abandoned me there and gone inside the ship.
    <br>I was there all alone crying with pain and hunger.
    <br>I saw a friend who worked with the ship and she asked me, "Bosco, what was the problem?"
    <br>I said, "I don't know; I am dying."
    <br>She took me to the manager of the ship and pleaded that they should help me.
    <br>That was when they issued me a ticket and I went into the ship.
    <br>Upon my arrival in Cameroon, I started hearing everywhere that I had died.
    <br>I was surprised.
    <br>That same day when I arrived, I slept.
    <br>In my dream, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Actually, I had been watching Emmanuel TV because I am a keen viewer.
    <br>I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in my dream.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua laid his hand on my head.
    <br>I had never fallen under the anointing but in that dream, I fell.
    <br>I tried to get up but no way.
    <br>He asked me to get up.
    <br>That was when I was able to get up.
    <br>The next morning, I realised that I was so strong.
    <br>The only thing that could indicate that I was sick was that I was lean.
    <br>Since then, I just started picking up.
    <br>I went again to the hospital for a check up because I felt OK.
    <br>I went to the hospital, they diagnosed that I was having no problem at all.
    <br>They said I was fine; I was not sick of any tuberculosis or gastric ulcer.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>Actually, after the doctor's result came out, that I had no tuberculosis again
    <br>or the gastric ulcer, from then I started going through the Bible
    <br>because I had no option other than to run to God.
    <br>That was my last option, He saved me.
    <br>I had been studying the Bible gradually, time after time.
    <br>I was just sitting in my house one fine day
    <br>and I received a call from an offshore company that they needed me.
    <br>Before then, I did not have a job.
    <br>As things went on, I received this call and I went there.
    <br>Behold, they offered me a job, a good job and I am earning a good salary.
    <br>I looked at these things and for me to appreciate God, I didn't know what to do.
    <br>I called a tattoo designer.
    <br>I said, "Please, I will need to see you in my house."
    <br>I gave him a word and said, "I want you to put this thing on my back."
    <br>He asked me, "What for?"
    <br>I said, "That is not your business, just do it."
    <br>He was expecting that I would give him signs, lizards, snakes or things.
    <br>When he realised, he asked what this was.
    <br>I said on the back was written, 'Jesus is Lord, T.B. Joshua my prophet'.
    <br>That is how it is.
    <br>I said, "Just do what I have asked you to do and leave."
    <br>He did that.
    <br>People of God, there was no way I could appreciate God
    <br>or exercise my joy other than doing that tattoo.
    <br>As I am talking with you, I am going to show you the tattoo.
    <br>After putting that tattoo on my back, I kept on reading the Bible.
    <br>This is the tattoo.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>As I was reading the Bible, I came to a certain place, the Book of Leviticus 19:28.
    <br>I realised that it is written there that we should not tattoo our bodies.
    <br>I called my friend, Collins and said, "Man, look what I have done!
    <br>I thought I was praising God. Instead, I have poured more petrol on the fire."
    <br>As I am here now, man of God, that was what brought me here.
    <br>I sent an email to The SCOAN and I received a call from the SCOAN.
    <br>Yes. He sent an email and showed that tattoo.
    <br>He said, "Please, help me. I don't know what to do",
    <br>because he knew he was in the grave already.
    <br>Suddenly, he saw the man of God in a dream laying hands on him and he woke up.
    <br>The stomach that was big disappeared and he got very strong.
    <br>On the second day he went to hospital and the doctors said he was free.
    <br>He said, "Ha. What can I do for this man? I don't have money to come to Nigeria."
    <br>He called a tattoo man.
    <br>The tattoo man said it was not the kind of thing they normally put in the body;
    <br>lizard or snake or whatever.
    <br>He said, "No. Please, put this one."
    <br>"- If I put this, you cannot remove it.
    <br>- Put it!"
    <br>And the man put the tattoo - the one he has just shown you people.
    <br>So, he started reading the Bible, and found in the Book of Leviticus 19:29:
    <br>"You shall not make any cutting in your flesh for the dead,
    <br>nor tattoo any marks on you: I am the Lord."
    <br>So, after seeing it, he started crying again,
    <br>that he was doing this to praise God, but he found this.
    <br>The same God said, "you should not do this," but he has done it.
    <br>Does it meant that the sickness will come back?
    <br>That is why he started crying.
    <br>When he was crying, he said, "I will die".
    <br>I said, "Come!"
    <br>If God said, "I am the Lord", what does that mean to you?
    <br>"I am the Lord."
    <br>Holy men were carried along by the Holy Ghost
    <br>to write the Word that came from God.
    <br>So, let's seek God Himself.
    <br>In John 4:24, the Lord says:
    <br>"God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>If God is Spirit and we that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and truth,
    <br>this means - we say, only faith pleases Him.
    <br>To worship Him - by faith.
    <br>The Bible says that faith is a spiritual issue.
    <br>It is not a natural issue.
    <br>If it is a spiritual issue, this means,
    <br>faith is of man's spirit, not mind, not of his body, not of his flesh.
    <br>Whatever you place in your flesh, on your body to glorify Him,
    <br>you are glorifying a god you do not know.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>Faith is of man's spirit, not mind,
    <br>I mean, of man's heart,
    <br>not of his flesh or body.
    <br>Whatever you now put in your body, or place in your flesh to please Him -
    <br>no, you are pleasing a god you do not know,
    <br>because He is Spirit and we worshipping Him must worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>We say, faith in God, faith from God, faith of God.
    <br>Remember, God is Spirit.
    <br>Now, just see it as one of those things for your body, not for God.
    <br>If you see it as one of those things in your body,
    <br>because you cannot remove it, it has become permanent, removing is not possible.
    <br>And if you now realise that this thing is not to please God but to please yourself,
    <br>see it as one of those things in your body, not for God.
    <br>If you see it like that, press forward and seek God.
    <br>It is over.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>See it as one of those things in your body.
    <br>You know, you do makeup - see it as one of those things:
    <br>you do makeup, eyelashes, lipstick.
    <br>See it as one of those things for yourself, not for God
    <br>and press forward to serve God in Spirit and truth.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>But don't see it as a way of pleasing God - that is wrong.
    <br>You are born again, you have realised that this tattoo in your body is not to please God,
    <br>because God is Spirit.
    <br>Take it like that and see it as one of those things like you do you hair... - it is one of those things.
    <br>If you see it as one of those things to please yourself and to make yourself feel good - fine,
    <br>but that is it.
    <br>So, press forward and serve God.
    <br>Don't let it disturb you again.
    <br>Don't say, "What can I do now?"
    <br>OK, you have realised that you are doing it not to please God but yourself.
    <br>Once you realise that, put it behind you.
    <br>Just leave it and continue serving your God.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>So, my brother, put it behind you. OK?
    <br>Since you cannot remove it, put it behind you.
    <br>Since you have realised that this is not to please God, it is over.
    <br>The picture there; it has no meaning to God.
    <br>He will not count it against you.
    <br>So, move forward and put it behind you.
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>Viewers all over the world, once again.
    <br>For those who thought they were doing it to glorify God with a tattoo,
    <br>maybe saying, "Jesus is Lord; Jesus is this", whatever you place,
    <br>remember, God is Spirit.
    <br>And since you have realised now that God is Spirit, and faith is of man's spirit,
    <br>not of man's flesh or whatever, put it behind you and move forward,
    <br>and worship your God is Spirit.
    <br>Don't let it bother you each time you see the tattoo.
    <br>No, it is over.
    <br>In the same vein, you can run in a moment and go on your knees and say, "Sorry",
    <br>and ask for forgiveness and God will forgive you.
    <br>And those who have done it, maybe a snake, lion, or whatever you put in your body,
    <br>in the same vein, when you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour in Spirit and truth,
    <br>whatever you put in your body, it has no meaning.
    <br>Move forward.
    <br>It is not only you, everything about you as you accept Jesus.
    <br>But people will be seeing the snake and whatever in your body, don't let it bother you.
    <br>Take your time to explain to them that, "Yes, I have received Jesus in Spirit and truth."
    <br>So, what they see on you does not mean anything to you because you cannot remove it.
    <br>Don't force yourself to remove and injure yourself,
    <br>and begin to go for treatment, x-ray, or surgery.
    <br>Because you are born again, you don't want people to see it in your life - this is a trap of satan.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is trap of satan."
    <br>I say it is a trap of satan.
    <br>They say you must do some surgery, operation to remove it.
    <br>"I read many books; people go for surgery because they are born again,
    <br>they don't want people to see it on their body" - no, it is a trap of satan.
    <br>Those things have no meaning.
    <br>Whether they see it or not - take your time to explain yourself.
    <br>Even those who had not put a tattoo in their body,
    <br>without a tattoo they were also slaves before they were delivered.
    <br>So, please, put it behind you and move forward.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>People of God, today, when we see the wise men and Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>casting demons out of human beings, we look at it as a film
    <br>or a modern cinema, if I should put it this way.
    <br>We don't want to know what gives demons the authority
    <br>to be using human bodies to torment people.
    <br>If you go back to the Book of Ecclesiastes 12:13-14,
    <br>you will realise that the only reason God created mankind was to please Him
    <br>and live for His own satisfaction, not for our own.
    <br>If we go contrary, we open the door for demons to come in.
    <br>Please, be on guard.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you. You listen to what he is trying to say.
    <br>If you have done the other way, maybe a tattoo,
    <br>and you have now accepted Jesus because of what was preached today...
    <br>When people have a tattoo, maybe a snake or whatever,
    <br>and they come to accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour,
    <br>they should let them know that they must accept Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>Once you do so, whatever you put in your body is nullified.
    <br>So, you don't need to go for surgery to begin to remove it, because it is a trap of satan.
    <br>That could turn to cancer, that could turn to another thing,
    <br>that would nullify, terminate your life, that could become another thing entirely,
    <br>in the process of saying you want to accept Jesus.
    <br>No - don't go to that extent.
    <br>Whatever is in your body, it is nullified and Jesus has accepted you as a loved one.
    <br>So, take note of this. This is advice for all over the world.
    <br>Many have this tattoo and they are worried,
    <br>"How can they accept Jesus? Is it possible to accept Jesus? Is it possible for Jesus to accept them?"
    <br>Until they removed this picture in their body - no.
    <br>Remember, we walk by faith, not by sight.
    <br>If you walk by faith, you cannot walk by sight.
    <br>If you walk by sight, you cannot walk by faith.
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>Man of God, when I received a call from you that night,
    <br>before man and God, I wanted to fly
    <br>but I realised that there were no wings.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>Man of God, to be frank, I was not even able to control my body because I was shivering.
    <br>A man from the dust has been called by the most popular man today on earth.
    <br>The question - you have not answered my question.
    <br>You say you wanted to fly.
    <br>Later you realised that you had no wings.
    <br>OK, what happened to you when you realised that you had no wings to fly?
    <br>I just stayed at that position where I received that call.
    <br>I was there for about ten minutes.
    <br>OK, thank you very much. 
    <br>You have listened to that.
    <br>I will join you to write a short book concerning those who have a tattoo,
    <br>because people need to read about it.
    <br>Even the message I'm giving now looks strange to many.
    <br>Yes - when you accept Jesus as your Lord...
    <br>There are two ways: accepting Him in the natural - you will still walk by sight,
    <br>but accepting Him in the Spirit - you will walk by faith.
    <br>So, when you accept Jesus, the only way to accept Jesus and have peace of heart,
    <br>is to accept Him by faith.
    <br>And when you accept Jesus by faith, you begin not to live by what you see,
    <br>your life will not depend on senses.
    <br>What you smell - "There is some odour here."
    <br>Before you talk, you examine that odour in the light of God's Word.
    <br>"Look at this man. He is slim. Look at the way he looks. What is he saying? His message is very nice."
    <br>Don't take that message yet; examine that message in the light of God's Word,
    <br>because even demons too, if they preach to you, you will think Jesus is close.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>That is the problem the whole world is facing today.
    <br>People are getting confused; they don't know who is who.
    <br>Who is the man of God and who is not the man of God?
    <br>Look at the message we read now - it says, "Says the Lord."
    <br>God said you should not close your eyes and you close it.
    <br>You will think there is no way.
    <br>"Says the Lord" - that is it.
    <br>But I'm telling you, "Says the Lord" - the Lord that is talking is the Spirit.
    <br>When you accept Him, whatever appearance is there in the natural, it is nullified.
    <br>Why does the Bible say, "If you march on a snake it will not hurt you"?
    <br>And why does the Bible say that if you take a deadly poison it will not harm you?
    <br>If you take a deadly poison it will not harm you, and when others take it, it will harm them.
    <br>That is to tell you that in the natural you are not like them.
    <br>You may have a tattoo, but you are not like them.
    <br>ARE TATTOOS SINFUL? T.B. Joshua
    <br>You may have a tattoo; you are not like others that have a tattoo,
    <br>when you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You may have a tattoo.
    <br>You are not like others who have tattoos
    <br>because you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Saviour in truth and faith;
    <br>your tattoo is nullified."
