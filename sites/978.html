    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>I know - because you see me in what you are wearing everyday.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't worry - next week you will see me wearing 'Agbada' (Nigerian robe).
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Even wearing this I am not comfortable enough.
    <br>I need to get used to it.
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>A New Beginning!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers, Happy New Year!
    <br>A New Beginning!
    <br>Take it; believe it.
    <br>When you say, "Happy New Year!", you are talking of faith.
    <br>You want to wine and dine with God – faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases Him – no alternative – no shortcut.
    <br>God wants to be involved in our lives as mother's.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God wants to be involved in our lives as mother's".
    <br>You know mother - good mother...
    <br>God is concerned about you; He is concerned about us.
    <br>He wants to be involved as a mother in our lives.
    <br>We just have to allow Him by faith.
    <br>Allow Him; that is why He tells us to pray.
    <br>The case now is: prayer is a work of faith.
    <br>You can't just rise and...
    <br>Christians we have today, all over the world, - we have a lot of challenges.
    <br>We can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith".
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>(You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.)
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.)
    <br>So, when you see your neighbour... he can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.
    <br>That is the problem.
    <br>That is just the problem - you don't know who is praying.
    <br>You can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.
    <br>This is what happens all over the world today - you see people; "fire, prayer in your house..."
    <br>Who is praying?
    <br>When you are a man of prayer and not a man of faith, you are saying words.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You are saying words when you are a man of prayer and not a man of faith.
    <br>You are saying words.
    <br>But when you are a man of prayer and a man of faith, you are praying prayer.
    <br>You can be saying words -
    <br>that is, you are talking to yourself and talking to people around you but not God.
    <br>Saying words is different from praying prayer.
    <br>Millions of prayers are prayed with almost no faith.
    <br>I repeat again: "Millions of prayers are prayed with almost no faith".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is what is happening; this is why there is no result.
    <br>This is why people shout - this is about prayers in churches everywhere; but the effect we cannot see.
    <br>Millions of prayers are prayed with almost no faith.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>So, it is possible...
    <br>So, when you see praying people - be conscious - is it really a man of faith?
    <br>Because you can be a man of prayer and perhaps not a man of faith.
    <br>You can be a woman of prayer and perhaps not a woman of faith.
    <br>When you are a woman of prayer and not a woman of faith, you are saying words -
    <br>that is, you talk.
    <br>You talk to people: people around you will hear you, "she is praying", and you inside will hear yourself, but God...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sometimes it is very frustrating to be talking to someone who is not a man of faith.
    <br>This is why we allow testimonies of people...
    <br>The Bible says when you see God as reliable, you put your trust in Him.
    <br>Ha - He is reliable, He can do it for me.
    <br>He has done it for this person, I can see what God had done - that is greater from what I am looking for.
    <br>"He had given a greater blessing to this person but I am looking for a small one - He will do it for me."
    <br>You put your trust in Him.
    <br>If you pay attention to God's Word, you will find that faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>Pay attention with all your heart.
    <br>It is that simple.
    <br>When you look at your Bible, you would agree with me: no faith, no God for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Open your Bible at the Book of Luke 8:25 - hear God's Word.
    <br>WHERE IS YOUR FAITH?
    <br>That is the language.
    <br>Luke 8:25
    <br>He says, "Where is your faith? If I cannot find your faith I cannot talk to you. If I talk to you you cannot receive."
    <br>WHERE IS YOUR FAITH?
    <br>I am here today to ask you: where is your faith?
    <br>Look at Luke 8:25.
    <br>WHERE IS YOUR FAITH?
    <br>Let someone say, "Where is your faith?"
    <br>(Where is your faith?)
    <br>It is like, "Where is your Bible?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is God's Word.
    <br>Where is your faith?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Mark 4:40; we hear what God said there.
    <br>He said, "Do you still have no faith?"
    <br>After having met them many times: "Do you still have no faith?"
    <br>It is for you to know the importance of it.
    <br>Do you still have no faith?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>(Do you still have no faith?)
    <br>That is the question here.
    <br>In every area.
    <br>When you look at the Book of John 20:27 - it says, "Stop doubting and believe."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The worst one in the Book of Mark 16:14 - it says, "When He saw their lack of faith, He rebuked them."
    <br>Cast them...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He said, "Aa, they have no faith" - He rebuked them.
    <br>He knew they were not for Him and they cannot ever be before Him without faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, therefore...
    <br>When you see people praying, it would be too early for you to say, "He is a child of God, or "A woman of faith",
    <br>because one can be a woman of prayer but perhaps not a woman of faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is difficult; people don't know.
    <br>People believe that once you pray you pray - no.
    <br>Saying words is different from praying prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us think about it and stop wasting your time.
    <br>You say, "I pray and no answer or result", while you are saying words.
    <br>When you are talking you are saying words and you say you pray.
    <br>Saying words is different from praying prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say, "I fast" - the same thing.
    <br>You can be fasting and that is for you and people around you.
    <br>God is a cheerful giver.
    <br>He wants to heal, bless and deliver you because He is so much concerned about you.
    <br>He loves you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To reach Him, prayer is the master key and prayer is a work of faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Find time, sit down and meditate over this - that, "I am just a woman of prayer, not a woman of faith.
    <br>I am just saying words, not praying prayer. I am just talking to people and myself. Not to God.
    <br>What a shameful thing; very embarrassing. I thought I was praying to God."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now - to have faith...
    <br>If you pay attention, you would find that faith comes spontaneously, that is, naturally.
    <br>Attention - what is attention?
    <br>All your heart, your soul.
    <br>All your heart; you listen to what they are saying.
    <br>Not to hear and monitor your business at the same time, instead of leaving your business for God.
    <br>So, I hear here and my mind is also over there.
    <br>All your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have to be very inquisitive.
    <br>Find out the truth and the truth will set you free.
    <br>Don't just take everything you hear.
    <br>Don't just take everything you hear and see; you must examine them in the light of God's Word.
    <br>To examine things in the light of God's Word is to ask, "God, what is this? God, what is that? God tell me more".
    <br>Examine everything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have come a long way.
    <br>You have been to many places – a lot of places of worship.
    <br>You have seen enough.
    <br>Having seen enough is to be able to discern the truth from the false.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>How do you know God loves you?
    <br>When you don't love Him and He loves you, how will you appreciate this?
    <br>You say "Amen."
    <br>How, can somebody...?
    <br>Tell me how do you know God loves you?
    <br>Without correspondence.
    <br>If I love you and don't love me, what kind of love is that?
    <br>No correspondence.
    <br>I love you and you don't love me.
    <br>... by your way, action, attitude - you don't love me.
    <br>What kind of love is that?
    <br>If I love you and you don’t respond, what kind of love is that?
    <br>It is not a good love.
    <br>That is the love you have for God.
    <br>We seem to be more of His enemy than His friend.
    <br>More of His enemy than His what?
    <br>His friend.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our challenges that are supposed to draw us close to God,
    <br>seem to take us off, take us away from God and that is the purpose of challenges.
    <br>The purpose of challenges is to draw us close.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your challenges, whatever you are going through -
    <br>sickness, hardship, setback, just name whatever you are going through -
    <br>are to draw you closer to Him but opposite is the case today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How many years are we taking to find out the truth?
    <br>For how long shall we continue finding out the truth?
    <br>Is it God, is it this, is it a challenge, is it devil - for how long?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What we received last year - where is it?
    <br>What are you asking for?
    <br>What we are asking for today are those things we have received in the past but we lack maintenance.
    <br>God wants to do awesome things but because of lack of dynamic faith,
    <br>those things cannot be done through us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lack of dynamic faith limits what God can do through us.
    <br>Faith is like coins – Heavenly currency.
    <br>How much you have is how much you get.
    <br>When you go to the market with million dollars, you cannot get more than this money in the market.
    <br>What you have is what you get.
    <br>This faith we talk about is Heavenly currency to get Heavenly resources.
    <br>Healing, salvation, blessing, breakthrough; we get them, we buy them.
    <br>You can purchase Heavenly resources with Heavenly currency.
    <br>How much you get is how much you obtain.
    <br>Your faith took you here today.
    <br>Will the same faith also get you what you want here?
    <br>How much will this faith obtain?
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Your faith got you here today.
    <br>Look at the analysis I have given you.
    <br>The voice of God - it says, "Where is your faith?"
    <br>That shows, if you don't have faith, He cannot address you.
    <br>Where is your faith?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you still have no faith?
    <br>That is - after much addressing, teaching, messages, going to churches, you are a Christian - yet
    <br>you still have no faith?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Stop doubting and believe.
    <br>Because of lack of faith, He rebuked brethren in the Book of Mark 16:14.
    <br>He rebuked them.
    <br>You are a satan, you are a devil - get behind me.
    <br>And I say, "Don't let us waste our time".
    <br>If you know how to pray and you are buying a book which teaches you how to pray...
    <br>You can be a woman of prayer but perhaps not a woman of faith.
    <br>Many of you have books that teach you...
    <br>When you are praying you have your own words.
    <br>You can be a woman of prayer but perhaps not a woman of faith
    <br>and if you pray without faith, you are saying words.
    <br>You can now think of challenges you have been facing.
    <br>Pray pray pray...
    <br>It may be you are saying words and not praying prayer.
