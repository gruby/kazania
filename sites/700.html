    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>You're a man.
    <br>Your affection is dead.
    <br>This is giving you loneliness.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Anybody that looks at you would say "hey" but you don't have affection.
    <br>Yes, I struggle too much. You're right, Man of God.
    <br>You don't have affection. Anybody that looks at you - you are a beautiful lady, beautiful woman -
    <br>they want to marry you but you don't have affection.
    <br>They would marry you, after getting married, they would realise that the affection is dead.
    <br>That is the challenge you are facing.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. You are very, very correct.
    <br>You are very, very right.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Obimma, and this is my lovely husband.
    <br>What the man of God said is very, very correct.
    <br>The problem started when I got married.
    <br>I got married at a very tender age - I was a virgin.
    <br>That very night was not easy for me.
    <br>I cried the whole way through.
    <br>When my mother-in-law noticed what was happening,
    <br>she called me aside and cuddled me.
    <br>She had to mix up some things that would help me calm down.
    <br>It didn't end there.
    <br>From that very moment, I developed phobia with anything that had to do with sex and being with a man.
    <br>Because after that day, I tried several times but I couldn't give in.
    <br>Everything was totally lost - completely out.
    <br>Anything that had to do with intercourse or being married as a couple - I didn't really like it.
    <br>It kept going on and on.
    <br>It kept affecting me so much, even after years of marriage.
    <br>In fact, we were just existing because I always wanted to be out of the house or taking a trip.
    <br>At times, I would use it against him.
    <br>I would say, "Maybe when I come back from London, we will continue", and I would go.
    <br>During that time I stayed for two years and came back again.
    <br>Then I said, "Okay, I have to go to South Africa".
    <br>I went and stayed for five years, then I came back again.
    <br>It wasn't only towards my husband; it was also to other men.
    <br>I would tend to be so aggressive towards people.
    <br>They would see me and like me.
    <br>There was no way that I would be moving around and not see 3 to 5 men staring at me.
    <br>At times, if they stared too long, I would ask them, "What for?"
    <br>It was really affecting me.
    <br>It would affect my business so badly.
    <br>For someone to even make it, a male counterpart would have to come in
    <br>but I was always so aggressive towards them.
    <br>I forgot about marriage.
    <br>I decided to go into business.
    <br>I was just married to my business, married to everything that I was doing.
    <br>It was not as if I was building a house or anything but I saw that business as a way to move away,
    <br>as a way to stay out and not have any form of marriage.
    <br>The affection was totally lost.
    <br>It was a very long time before I conceived.
    <br>On my first and only conception, God blessed me so much.
    <br>By then we had been watching Emmanuel TV because we heard about it in South Africa.
    <br>Even on the day of conception, I was pushing my husband away.
    <br>He was always begging.
    <br>He would say, "Mommy, come now."
    <br>I would say, "No, not tonight".
    <br>I would say, "I'm tired - I'm just coming back".
    <br>But that night, I had gone so long without giving him anything, that I said, "Okay, let me do it".
    <br>Even when he came, I said, "Do this thing fast and let me go".
    <br>When I conceived, it was months after the conception before I realised I was pregnant
    <br>because I didn't know thatjust one short time could get me pregnant.
    <br>As God would have it, I delivered twins - a boy and a girl.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Obimma
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Even before I came here, I was hoping for another kind of prophecy.
    <br>When the man of God told me that, I realised it was the root of my problem.
    <br>Indeed, it was the root of my problem.
    <br>Loneliness had come in, boredom - he would ask me out and I would say, "No".
    <br>I wouldn't go anywhere; I would just stay indoors.
    <br>If I wasn't doing business or had to draw money, I didn't want to go out
    <br>because I didn't want to be around anybody who would be frolicking around me.
    <br>Now, after seeing my bundles of joy, I wanted to conceive again.
    <br>You mean immediately the man of God gave you that prophecy,
    <br>you just saw it as a channel of hope?
    <br>When what you are not expecting is thrown at you -
    <br>I was so overwhelmed because it was as if someone somewhere who knew me
    <br>had told the man of God what my problem was.
    <br>You can't imagine the kind of feelings I had inside me.
    <br>So the problem affected your marriage to the extent that after that first child,
    <br>you tried to conceive again but because of that lack of affection, you could not go ahead.
    <br>I still couldn't go ahead. When it was time for us to meet,
    <br>I would say to myself, "Okay, tonight I will try" and I would prepare myself
    <br>but when the time came, I would still push him away.
    <br>But immediately the man of God gave that prophecy,
    <br>can you tell us what God did in your life?
    <br>After the man of God gave me the prophecy, I became so light.
    <br>That very day, I was set free and felt as if I was empty and light.
    <br>I knew something had left me.
    <br>My name is Mr Isaac Obimma.
    <br>We know you would also like to introduce the person standing beside you.
    <br>She is my lovely wife.
    <br>Your lovely wife. Hallelujah.
    <br>When she came back home that Sunday, she told me the prophecy.
    <br>I already knew what the problem was.
    <br>For one reason or another, I couldn't watch Emmanuel TV that Sunday but today,
    <br>I was able to capture the prophecy, which was exactly the problem we were having.
    <br>I'm here today to testify that the prophecy was a hundred percent correct.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Obimma
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>We just want to ask you briefly as a husband,
    <br>how did that problem of lack of affection affect you as a man?
    <br>Well, what it calls for is patience and talk to God.
    <br>He always resolves all issues.
    <br>While all this was going on, I knew that one day the end would come and here we are today.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We thank God.
    <br>Madam, after that prophetic message, we saw how the man of God delivered you
    <br>in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Looking at your husband, how do you now feel towards your husband?
    <br>I feel wonderful - so good.
    <br>Even when I met him --- he is the one 'giving me a tough time' now.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus for the restoration of this marriage!
    <br>At a particular time, I went to him and laid my hand on him; I wanted to lie ---
    <br>He was like, "Hey, what is going on?"
    <br>He was really surprised, after many years of lack of affection in the marriage.
    <br>Because I did not really allow it before.
    <br>Hallelujah. We thank God for the wonderful restoration of this marriage.
    <br>What advice do you want to give to the world
    <br>concerning what God has done in your life through the power of prophecy?
    <br>Okay, I will use my own case as an example.
    <br>This particular thing has destroyed lots of marriages, many homes.
    <br>I was just so fortunate to have this kind of a man,
    <br>because it's not every man that can stand that.
    <br>I know what I'm saying because I'm the one that caused all the havoc.
    <br>It's not every man that can just 'starve' like that - let me just put it in that way.
    <br>Or you leave the man for a long while; you are abroad and he is there.
    <br>Even when he came to visit, there was a particular time he came and we didn't even do anything.
    <br>It was like, "Why did I even come here in the first place?"
    <br>So my advice to people like that is to seek the face of God; something is wrong somewhere.
    <br>As soon as I got delivered, I got myself back.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let us put our hands together once again for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>My advice: It's not the best to wish to any man but when it comes your way,
    <br>rest your hope on God. It's as simple as that.
    <br>Hallelujah! We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful blessing He has granted onto this family.
    <br>I want to advise you that now God Almighty has done this wonderful thing,
    <br>continue to make His word the standard for your life and for your marriage
    <br>and we know more and more blessings are on the way. Hallelujah!
    <br>Hallelujah. We give glory to God Almighty!
    <br>Let us put our hands together once again for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
