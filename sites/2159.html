    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The footage you are about to watch documents the humanitarian mission of the Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>sent by T.B. Joshua to Kaduna, Nigeria.
    <br>In the early hours of the morning, two trailers loaded to capacity with bag upon bag of top quality rice
    <br>pull up outside The SCOAN's headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Getting swiftly to work, the Emmanuel TV Team and youth workers start the job of offloading it
    <br>into one of the Emmanuel TV rice storerooms.
    <br>As one team continues to offload the trailers, another team begins the process of measuring the rice
    <br>into the new family-sized Emmanuel TV rice bags,
    <br>before sewing them shut with specialised industrial sewing machines
    <br>and arranging them in neat piles ready for distribution to the needy.
    <br>The MIRACLE Of LOVE!!! ❤️
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to help
    <br>to help and be helped
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to give
    <br>to give and receive
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to live
    <br>to live for eternity
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to help
    <br>to help and be helped
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team are heading to Kaduna State, northern Nigeria, for yet another humanitarian mission.
    <br>The team will be taking two trailers with them, each carrying two thousand bags of rice,
    <br>making a total of four thousand bags.
    <br>Travelling by night along the inter-state express ways,
    <br>the team makes good progress in covering the almost 900 kilometer distance to their destination - Kaduna State,
    <br>affectionately nicknamed, "The center of education."
    <br>The team journeys all the way to the northern region of Kaduna, to an area called Doka,
    <br>to one of the central meeting points of the area.
    <br>As soon as the trucks have come to a stop, the Emmanuel TV team begins to uncover the trucks after the long journey.
    <br>News quickly spreads across the community of the Emmanuel TV team's arrival
    <br>and people begin to turn up in numbers for the event.
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to help
    <br>to help and be helped
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to give
    <br>to give and receive
    <br>With more and more people continuing to arrive late into the afternoon, the area quickly becomes full.
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to live
    <br>to live for eternity
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to help
    <br>to help and be helped
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to give
    <br>to give and receive
    <br>Let me be known by love I need love to live
    <br>to live for eternity
    <br>Sons and daughters of love
    <br>Let us act love
    <br>Many women and their children have joined the crowd, as they wait to meet the Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>and hear what has brought them all the way across Nigeria, from Lagos State.
    <br>Here we are in Kaduna State, in a place called Doka, Kaduna North Local Government.
    <br>We are right inside Sabongida Home For The Needy where we have people with various challenges
    <br>who have come to receive the gifts sent by Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We have come with gifts for them.
    <br>We have two trailers of rice - one trailer containing two thousand bags of rice
    <br>and the second trailer contains two thousand bags of rice.
    <br>Altogether, we have four thousand bags of rice for the people here in Kaduna State, Nigeria.
    <br>We have come to give to them and let them know that they are to love their neighbours as themselves and let love lead.
    <br>Translation In Hausa Language
    <br>Assisted by the locals in the area, the Emmanuel TV Team helps to unload the thousands of bags of rice
    <br>and take it into the meeting point's public storeroom.
    <br>With a determined effort, the storeroom is filled with top quality rice
    <br>ready to be distributed to the community and its environs.
    <br>We have their leader waiting patiently to receive this gift so they can in turn give this gift to their people.
    <br>So, any moment from now, we are going to meet their leader and hand over this gift to them.
    <br>Join us as we meet the leaders. Thank you.
    <br>Muntari Saleh
    <br>Leader Of The Blind, Kaduna North
    <br>We are the ones you brought gifts to from T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Sincerely speaking, no one has ever shown us this kind of care and love.
    <br>Abdulahi Sama'ila Galadima
    <br>Leader Of The Crippled, Kaduna North
    <br>We are very grateful to T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Alhasan Musa
    <br>Leader Of The Lepers, Doka, Kaduna North
    <br>Our thanks go to the Almighty God.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, God will bless you.
    <br>We have come from T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We have come with cash gifts and also bags of rice for you.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team At A Home For The Needy In Doka, Kaduna, Nigeria
    <br>We have two trailers of rice for you all.
    <br>We also have a cash gift of one million naira.
    <br>It is an expression of our love for you and also to let you know that you should let love lead.
    <br>Apart from this cash gift and these bags of rice that have been sent from T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV,
    <br>he also said that we should let you know
    <br>that your sons and daughters will be offered scholarships to go to school.
    <br>Thank you, T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV!
    <br>Right now, we want to hand over the cash gift of one million naira to one of your leaders.
    <br>Thank you, T.B. Joshua!
    <br>One Million Naira Given By Emmanuel TV To A Home For The Needy In Kaduna
    <br>Translation In Hausa Language
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team At A Home For The Needy In Doka, Kaduna, Nigeria
    <br>Muntari Saleh
    <br>Leader Of The Blind, Kaduna North
    <br>What I have to say about this is that I am so, so happy.
    <br>When one is as happy as this, one would want to cry.
    <br>I am telling you that my eyes are filled with tears of joy
    <br>because of what T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV have done for us.
    <br>What a surprise and a joyful occurrence!
    <br>This person, we don't know him and he doesn't know us.
    <br>Because he is such a merciful person, he is thinking of how we, people with disabilities, will eat
    <br>and how we pay our children's school fees.
    <br>His mercy is so deep that when he eats, he is not content that he alone has eaten, but he is thinking of us.
    <br>He is always thinking of how he can help us, the people who must go into the streets to beg before we eat.
    <br>T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners decided to help us,
    <br>the people with disabilities here in the northern part of Nigeria, Kaduna.
    <br>They did not give us what they do not like; they gave us what they cherished.
    <br>They brought four thousand bags of rice and one million naira.
    <br>For this, we thank T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>It is only God that can reward them.
    <br>We are calling on the privileged in the society in Nigeria.
    <br>We know they are many.
    <br>This is a challenge to the Federal Government all the way down to Local Governments -
    <br>from the top, those wealthy politicians, business people, academics and the elites.
    <br>They all need to emulate this man.
    <br>With what T.B. Joshua has done for us, if other Nigerians emulate him and help us,
    <br>I assure you that there will be no more street begging in the hot sun, rain and cold.
    <br>We are challenging the well-to-do in the society from this part of the country
    <br>to emulate what T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners are doing for us.
    <br>They should learn and do the same. If they do this, we will pray against trouble.
    <br>But when you are hungry, you will not be able to pray because everything in life requires focus.
    <br>Look at what T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners have done for us.
    <br>We pray that God will reward them abundantly.
    <br>May God multiply their wealth.
    <br>May God place them in a higher position of honour that they would not expect.
    <br>May God protect them for us.
    <br>May God help them.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Abdulahi Sama'ila Galadima
    <br>Leader Of The Crippled, Kaduna North
    <br>We thank Almighty God for bringing us to this day
    <br>on which T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners gave us this huge gift so that we will benefit and enjoy life.
    <br>May God also grant them more grace and a fulfilled life.
    <br>May God protect them against every trouble.
    <br>We pray the privileged in society would emulate T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners who thought about us.
    <br>Street begging and all the crises are caused by poverty.
    <br>He who lacks would not mind destroying his neighbours.
    <br>If you are comfortable, you will not look for trouble.
    <br>Many troubles today are the result of lack of mercy, love, care and willingness to assist.
    <br>If they were merciful to us, there are so many things God would prevent.
    <br>If you show mercy to people with disabilities, trouble will become a thing of the past.
    <br>We are calling on the privileged in society to emulate T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>God will bless them, reward them, protect them and grant us peace in our country.
    <br>Every week when we pray for peace in Nigeria,
    <br>we will include T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners in our prayers.
    <br>Alhasan Musa
    <br>Leader Of The Lepers, Doka, Kaduna North
    <br>What should I say except that God should bless T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Look at one million naira in my hands!
    <br>Since I was born, I have never held one million naira.
    <br>Look at one million naira in my hands!
    <br>This is a result of T.B. Joshua's generosity.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, we pray that other Nigerians will emulate you.
    <br>Begging has ended in our lives, courtesy of Emmanuel TV Partners!
    <br>May God assist T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Look at one million naira in my hands!
    <br>Since I was born, I have never held one million naira.
    <br>It is only in this time of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, may God give you the grace to end well.
    <br>For what he has done for us, may God place him in a higher position in Nigeria.
    <br>Nigeria and her government, may God give you the grace to emulate him.
    <br>We are tired of begging.
    <br>T.B. Joshua has put an end to our begging.
    <br>Nigerians, clap for him!
    <br>You, Emmanuel TV Team, may God also promote you.
    <br>Only the faithful ones can be entrusted to give this type of gift.
    <br>May God grant you journey mercies home.
    <br>May God continue to promote T.B. Joshua.
    <br>May God promote him because he shines a light.
    <br>It is God that gives him the grace to do this.
    <br>There are many wealthy people in Nigeria but has anyone ever done this for us?
    <br>Have any of them ever given us one million naira?
    <br>Thanks be to God!
    <br>My name is Mohammed Usman
    <br>I finished school in 1996.
    <br>Until now, I don't have a job. I can't get any help.
    <br>Today, I am so happy. I may cry because of my happiness with the gift from T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>I want to thank him on behalf of the people with disabilities.
    <br>If other people did this for us, nobody would be on the street begging.
    <br>We started begging because we didn't have anything to eat.
    <br>We don't have anything for our health.
    <br>We don't have anything to help our parents or families with.
    <br>Because of that, I want to thank him; I want to pray for him.
    <br>May God Almighty continue to guide him and help him in all his activities.
    <br>My name is Ismail Jamaika. I am a blind man.
    <br>I say thanks be to Almighty God who created us.
    <br>I believe that if people will assist like T.B. Joshua has, I believe that no one would go on the street to beg.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>because they have done something nobody has done, particularly in the north.
    <br>Nobody has done it. If there is somebody who has already done this like T.B. Joshua, let him introduce himself
    <br>or let him come here and say, "I have already done this thing."
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to pray for these people.
    <br>May God guide them and protect them.
    <br>I am extremely happy. I don't know what to say.
    <br>Those who can speak Hausa and English don't know how to say anything
    <br>except thanks to the Almighty God who brought you here.
    <br>On behalf of our people, I want to use this opportunity to thank you and pray for you.
    <br>May God guide you and protect you.
    <br>Thank you and may God bless you.
    <br>Hauwa T. Hassan
    <br>Leader Of The Women
    <br>What I have to say concerning these gifts from Emmanuel TV Partners is that we are happy and grateful for them
    <br>and we pray that God will make our brothers and sisters who are wealthy emulate these good works.
    <br>May God help him.
    <br>May God make ways for him.
    <br>On our part, may we continue to pray for him.
    <br>Those who lack the idea and courage to do these good works,  may God give them the grace.
    <br>We are very grateful.
    <br>May God reward him.
    <br>May God grant you all journey mercies back.
    <br>Mallam Adamu Zubairu
    <br>Spokesman Of District Head, Doka
    <br>On behalf of the District Head, I am here to thank you
    <br>and convey the best wishes of His Royal Highness because of these gifts
    <br>you brought to our brothers, the crippled and those with disabilities.
    <br>As you came peacefully, may you return peacefully.
    <br>We are now calling on our brothers, government, other organisations and the well-to-do in the society
    <br>to emulate the beautiful works you are doing.
    <br>There is something that makes this very interesting.
    <br>You, who brought these gifts, do not share the same faith with us, yet you came to do this here.
    <br>You are showing the world clearly that giving should not be limited to tribe or religion.
    <br>Each time we find ourselves with good intentions, carrying out good works such as you have done,
    <br>it is an opportunity to remind ourselves that we need to achieve the aim of living together in peace.
    <br>On behalf of Zazzau Emirate Council, we express our gratitude for everything given to us by T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>May God reward them.
    <br>May God strengthen their determination to continue these good works.
    <br>May God promote them.
    <br>Now, to everyone who is watching, if he has been thinking in his mind that there are problems between Christians and Muslims,
    <br>even if there have been such thoughts, such a person would remove them.
    <br>This is a clear indication that unity and peace have been built.
    <br>What is happening here is self-explanatory.
    <br>Those who want us to live in peace in Nigeria are more in number than those who do not want us to live in peace.
    <br>I believe you understand this.
    <br>Abdulahi Alshasan
    <br>Kaduna, Nigeria
    <br>Sincerely speaking, I am very happy with what has happened.
    <br>I am begging the wealthy in society to emulate his good works.
    <br>I am so happy because in the kind of suffering we are, so many people have forgotten about us but this man has revived us.
    <br>If we have five people like this in Nigeria, we will be happy because we will not beg.
    <br>Therefore, we are praying that God will bless them.
    <br>Truly, I am so happy.
    <br>My name is Hauwa Katsina, the wife of Abdul Mumuni.
    <br>I am very happy today.
    <br>We are very happy with this man who gave this gift to us, may God bless him.
    <br>Everyone that is here is so happy and will never forget this good gesture.
    <br>May God increase his wealth.
    <br>We are so very happy.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Praying For T.B. Joshua
    <br>And The Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>These gifts will help us immensely.
    <br>Right now, many do not have a penny to buy food to eat but now they have more than enough to eat.
    <br>Because he helped us, may God bless him.
    <br>Look at the lepers, crippled and blind.
    <br>They are all very happy. May God bless this man that helped us. May God guide him.
    <br>May God guide him and protect him.
    <br>We urge everybody to continue to pray for him so that God will lift him high.
    <br>My name is Aisha.
    <br>I am so happy.
    <br>I am very, very grateful for what this man has done for us.
    <br>May Almighty God continue to bless him. May God give him a happy ending.
    <br>May God continue to lift him high, both in Heaven and on earth.
    <br>We are grateful; may God bless him. May God increase his wealth. Thank you.
    <br>We have seen that he has good character.
    <br>He is building up relationships. He loves us more than others.
    <br>We are grateful; may God bless him.
    <br>My name is Ladi.
    <br>May God bless him for the gift he gave us.
    <br>May God open his ways and give journey mercies to those who came with the gifts.
    <br>May God bless them. May God open his ways.
    <br>Saminu
    <br>A Leader Of The Crippled In Kaduna
    <br>I wish to express my appreciation for these gifts that were brought to us.
    <br>There is nothing we can do for them except pray for them.
    <br>May God promote whatever they do.
    <br>We are calling on our leaders here in the north and the wealthy to show mercy and have faith to emulate what this man is doing.
    <br>T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners, we are grateful to you.
    <br>We are calling on our leaders and the well-to-do in society, especially in the north to emulate what this man of God has done in our lives.
    <br>What a surprise! He brought us food and money all the way from Lagos down to the north!
    <br>He brought us one million naira!
    <br>The people who received the funds are trustworthy people and I am sure they will distribute it in a fair manner.
    <br>We are very, very grateful. May God continue to help them.
    <br>My name is Salisu Ibrahim. Honestly, we are grateful and say, may God bless him.
    <br>For the rice he brought, may God increase his wealth.
    <br>It is only God that will bless him. He has done well and God will help him.
    <br>May God grant every of his heart's desire. May God reward them.
    <br>My name is Abdulhaliu.Today, we have been given rice.
    <br>For this gift, may God increase his blessings. And for you that have brought this gift, may God bless you also.
    <br>May God bless you and increase your faith.
    <br>May God give us understanding.
    <br>Look, I too have received a blessing. May God bless the giver.
    <br>May God open their ways to do more in the future.
    <br>May God reward them. Honestly speaking, I am overjoyed with this help.
    <br>May God reward them. I have received my own share of the gift. Thank you, I will feed my children with it.
    <br>I am very grateful. Well done and thank you.
    <br>I am Elisha David Makama.
    <br>Indeed, I am very happy. I appreciate what T.B. Joshua has done for us, especially at this period.
    <br>My family and myself are going to get rice to eat without any problems.
    <br>So, I am grateful for what he has done. I pray to Almighty God to continue to open the way for him to continue helping the less privileged.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>My name is Usman Muhammadu.
    <br>Honestly speaking, we are very happy. May God continue to reward them. May God reward them.
    <br>May God give us long life to see another day like this.
    <br>May God continue to strengthen them for this help they have rendered us. May God reward them and bless them.
    <br>I reside at L.E.A Tudun Nupawa.
    <br>My name is Wusilah Ibrahim. I am so grateful. I pray that God would strengthen them to continue the good works from every angle.
    <br>May God give us strength and wisdom so that we too can help others the way he is helping us.
    <br>My name is Abubakar. I am so happy with the person who gave us this assistance.
    <br>If there were more people like him, the less-privileged in society would not suffer.
    <br>We are very happy and grateful. May God bless him. Thank you.
    <br>My name is Alhaji Audu. May God bless T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners the more. We are happy.
    <br>We are full of joy about this gift we have received. May God help him and protect his faith.
    <br>My name is Mohammed Sani. I am full of joy for what is happening here this morning.
    <br>Nobody has ever given us this kind of assistance.
    <br>May God continue to bless and protect T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>May God uplift and honour him. We are very grateful.
    <br>If there were more people like him in society, we would not beg. We beg because we do not have any other choice.
    <br>May God bless the Emmanuel TV Team who brought the gifts to us. Thank you.
    <br>My name is Bawa. May God reward T.B. Joshua for the joy he has given me in my heart.
    <br>May God always favour and bless him. I pray that God will always favour him.
    <br>I am grateful to T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>My name is Yakubu. May God have mercy on him, give him more wisdom and bless him. Thank you very much.
    <br>My name is Asama'u. May God reward T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners. What he has done for us has gladdened our hearts.
    <br>He knows our plight. May God reward him.
    <br>My name is Yusuf. We are very happy and grateful. May God's blessing and grace be upon his life.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>My name is Bashiru Sani. May God Almighty reward T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>If the wealthy in society were helping us like T.B. Joshua, our suffering would reduce.
    <br>May God bless him more and more. May God grant him all his heart's desires.
    <br>May God protect him from evil. If there were more people helping us, trouble in society would be averted.
    <br>Instead of arresting and detaining us for begging, those in position should emulate T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Nigeria would then be peaceful. No wealthy person or anyone occupying a position in this society  has done what T.B. Joshua has done for us.
    <br>He gave us rice and one million naira to share among us.
    <br>This is somebody from the far south helping us. May they emulate him. May God reward him and let others emulate him.
    <br>By helping those in need, T.B. Joshua is progressing and he will end well.
    <br>May God credit everything he is doing for humanity to his Heavenly account.
    <br>My name is Esther. I am physically challenged.
    <br>I believe that there is ability in disability.
    <br>I am very, very excited because I have never seen such a thing in my life before.
    <br>We have been hearing about Emmanuel TV and T.B. Joshua and we watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We always watch and say that there is no chance for us to go to Lagos.
    <br>This man - I don't know what to say. Even without giving to me, when he gives my people with disabilities that I used to see on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>I am always excited when I see it and hear it.
    <br>I go where they watch Emmanuel TV and I am always excited. I am so excited I don't know what to do.
    <br>I said, "God, may Your will be done and may You give him long life". I have nothing else to say than thank you.
    <br>Because it is not easy for somebody to come and carry everybody's problems.
    <br>Like now, he wants us to be together and that is the peace we are praying for in Nigeria.
    <br>We are praying to God that the peace of God should reign in the whole world.
    <br>This man is showing us love and how to stay in peace with one another.
    <br>We don't have anything else to say than to pray for him for more blessing and long life.
    <br>Before he gave us, he knew we had nothing to give him back.
    <br>We cannot pay him back; only God Almighty can reward him and give him more strength to work in His vineyard.
    <br>I am so happy - I can not explain my happiness.
    <br>We only ask God Almighty to bless T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When you are doing something, don't think of today; just think of tomorrow because after this world, there is another one.
    <br>What this man is doing, only one person is doing it.
    <br>If people who have something with which to support really wanted to do something and join this brother,
    <br>I don't think you would see anybody on the street begging today.
    <br>Let them know. Anybody that has ears, let them hear. If they can assist, let them assist.
    <br>And those that are assisting, God will continue to bless them, strengthen them and provide for them, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Actually, we are suffering. Most of us don't have a house to stay in.
    <br>When our children finished school and were supposed to write their exams, we didn't have money for them to go and they were passed by.
    <br>Most of us, when we want to rent a house and go to the landlord, they will look at you and tell you to go and come back.
    <br>They will not even give you a house to stay in. So, we are suffering.
    <br>I use this tricycle to sell pure water and drinks in the market. I freeze them and put a small amount here.
    <br>As people know I suffer, they help me and buy. That is how I am surviving.
    <br>I have no father; I have no mother. We are all excited and grateful. God bless Emmanuel TV.
    <br>God bless Emmanuel TV
    <br>He has given us joy in our hearts
    <br>God bless Emmanuel TV
    <br>He is full of goodness
    <br>God bless Emmanuel TV
    <br>He has given us joy in our hearts
    <br>God bless Emmanuel TV
    <br>He is full of goodness
    <br>He has given us joy
    <br>God bless Emmanuel TV
    <br>He has given us joy in our hearts
    <br>My name is Mr Terhemba Ende.
    <br>I work with Radio Nigeria, Kaduna. I am a broadcaster.
    <br>I was on my way coming, together with my family. I parked my car there.
    <br>My family, my wife and daughter are now inside the car.
    <br>I used to drive on this road and this is where these people stay.
    <br>So, when I was coming, I saw that the whole place was crowded. All that came to my mind from a distance was
    <br>that maybe they had come to raid them out of these premises.
    <br>But as a broadcaster, as a radio man, as a media man, I am inquisitive. I decided to park down there and take a walk.
    <br>And lo and behold, when I came here, the first thing I saw was the Emmanuel TV crew.
    <br>Then my mind immediately remembered, because I am an ardent viewer of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Sometime last week, I was watching Emmanuel TV. I saw the Emmanuel TV crew in Maidugiri, in the far north.
    <br>Imagine going from Lagos to the far north, bringing relief materials, food, clothing and everything else. I was so impressed.
    <br>I never knew Kaduna, where we are now, would be next. This is love.
    <br>What T.B. Joshua is doing is the best. He is showing love.
    <br>If we can have people like T.B. Joshua, like one or two in each state, Nigeria, this country, would be a good place to live in.
    <br>T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV, may God bless them! May God bless him!
    <br>What T.B. Joshua is doing is going to give them hope. It is going to rekindle them.
    <br>They will now know that someone cares for them and loves them.
    <br>Before, they didn't know there was someone. We have governments - governments come and governments go.
    <br>Nobody has ever brought them relief materials or shown them love or care.
    <br>By presenting these gift items to them, you are showing them that they are also human beings.
    <br>You are also showing them that someone out there cares for them, somebody out there loves them,
    <br>irrespective of their religion, tribe or where they come from.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, let's have like ten T.B. Joshuas in Nigeria and this country would be a better place to live in.
    <br>The word of advice I have for society in general is, let us try to be our brothers' keeper.
    <br>Let us show love, irrespective of where you come from, whether you are a Muslim or a Christian.
    <br>Look here. Predominately, these people are Muslims. There is not one single Christian here.
    <br>But T.B. Joshua is extending his love to them. So, let us emulate the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I feel content. You can see that every one of them is happy. They are happy; there is no fighting.
    <br>They have received the impact of love and likeness. They feel they belong to the society.
    <br>The message I will take back to my colleagues is that I have seen it; I used to watch it on TV.
    <br>Some people will say that maybe it is dramatized or stage managed. This is real! Look at them taking their bags away.
    <br>My colleagues back there, my neighbours back home and my colleagues in the office, this is what I will also tell them, that
    <br>give out what you love most to who needs it and see what will happen to you.
    <br>My name is Sani Mohammed. I have seen what has given me joy in my heart.
    <br>I am grateful and I am still thanking you. The people of Kaduna State thank you.
    <br>Giving Thanks To T.B. Joshua
    <br>And Emmanuel TV Partners In Hausa
    <br>Joy is an understatement. There are a lot of people who just heard the news and rushed down to partake.
    <br>He has done well; may God bless and strengthen him. Even those inside the villages rushed down to partake.
    <br>They are grateful. May God bless him.
    <br>May God continue to keep us in peace. Thank you.
    <br>Esther Nyam
    <br>The Leader Of Widows, Kaduna
    <br>Truly, we are grateful for the gifts T.B. Joshua has given us. We have been hearing about him and watching him on TV.
    <br>We had been asking when he was going to come and help us as he had been doing for other people in places like Lagos.
    <br>Sincerely, we are grateful. There is nothing more I can say than to ask God to continue to give him more strength
    <br>because it is not everybody that has mercy on us the way T.B. Joshua does.
    <br>We are expecting that this is not all that we are going to get, that next year, we will receive houses so that we will benefit like others.
    <br>Thank you. We are grateful to him. Honestly speaking, we are suffering in terms of where to live.
    <br>We thank T.B. Joshua for giving us one million naira and rice. May God reward him. Thank you so much.
    <br>My name is Mohammed Abubakar. To God who made me, we are so overjoyed with this man of God.
    <br>We don't even know him and he doesn't know us but he did what God wanted him to do. He has helped us with the help of God.
    <br>May God continue to strengthen him. We are calling our brothers who are privileged in the society to emulate what this man of God is doing.
    <br>You can see that he is not a Muslim but God has given him the heart of mercy and pity in order to help us, the less privileged.
    <br>May God increase his wealth and protect him against blackmailers. May God bless him. May God reward him. Thank you.
    <br>My name is Hadiza. To God be the glory. We are thanking God for this help that he has rendered to us. May God reward them.
    <br>We will always be grateful. My fellow people with disabilities, we really need assistance in the form of jobs so that we don't have to continue begging.
    <br>We are ashamed of begging; none of us want to beg.
    <br>May God continue to bless Emmanuel TV Partners and T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My name is Aisha Musa. To God be the glory! We are happy and we will continue to be happy because nobody has ever done this for us.
    <br>No one has ever done what they did for us today. If they had been doing this before, we would have been happy.
    <br>There is nothing more I can say. I am a Muslim and whenever I want to pray, I will remember him in my prayers.
    <br>So, we pray that God would reward him and that our leaders would emulate what T.B. Joshua is doing.
    <br>Thank you. May God reward T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>We are grateful to you that have brought the gifts. We wish you traveling mercies.
    <br>Ramatu Ahmed
    <br>Secretary of the Association of Women With Disabilities, Kaduna
    <br>The Lord has sent the Emmanuel TV Team to come and visit the vulnerable people, who are the physically challenged, the deaf and blind,
    <br>to assist them with such a wonderful gift. Not only the gift but also scholarships
    <br>and the one million naira which was given to the people with disabilities. I think it is a great joy.
    <br>This is the first time in Kaduna State that this has happened. We have been seeing all the assistance given to people with disabilities.
    <br>Something like this has not happened. But we hope that Kaduna State will look at it.
    <br>I have had this disability from age 6 and I have never been a beneficiary of any scholarship until I finished my education.
    <br>Now, I am a married woman with three kids and I sponsor my children by myself.
    <br>I have tried everywhere to try and secure a job, without success. I have only worked under a one man business or I do business on my own.
    <br>So, I think that if such a thing could be introduced to people with disabilities, poverty will reduce in our country, not just in the states alone.
    <br>About 99 percent of persons with disabilities are from the north.
    <br>When you go to the streets, you would find that the northern people with disabilities are the ones begging.
    <br>This assistance given to people with disabilities will help them a lot.
    <br>And with the scholarships that have been given to children of people with disabilities in our state today, it will continue until the world comes to an end.
    <br>Then, we also want to use this opportunity to thank him. It is only God that will reward him because what he is doing for people with disabilities;
    <br>it is like he has already been in paradise. He is not only assisting; he is revealing the life of people with disabilities to others worldwide.
    <br>We even wished we could have a way to see him personally.
    <br>We thought that we would be among you today because by the time we reach home we could tell them
    <br>that we have seen T.B. Joshua - the T.B. Joshua we have been watching on television.
    <br>We have been seeing his performance and whatever he has been doing.
    <br>So, I will go home today and tell my parents that this is what the Prophet has come to do for us in Kaduna State.
    <br>My name is Aliyu. I am so happy and I wish T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners more blessings and success.
    <br>When I get home, I will tell my mother that a man with a compassionate heart has come from far away to come and assist us here.
    <br>I am wishing him more blessings and success. That is all I have to say.
    <br>My name is Gbenga Oluwole. I am from Ondo, Nigeria
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV for more than three years now.
    <br>When I went to Lagos in February/March, I was in the service on Sunday.
    <br>I came to the gathering on Monday for blessing.
    <br>Since I left Lagos for Kaduna, God has been so wonderful and faithful.
    <br>We always see it on television but what baffled me a lot was when I was going, I saw the Emmanuel TV bags of rice.
    <br>This is the man of God we are seeing on Emmanuel TV. He is real today in Kaduna State!
    <br>We are praying for him that his ministry will be moving forward in Jesus' name.
    <br>As he has remembered the needy; he too will never lack, in Jesus' name. His family will never lack, in Jesus' name.
    <br>If one man of God could be doing this all over the world - I know this thing he was doing today is not only in Kaduna;
    <br>he is doing it in other places in the northern areas. He doesn't say, "They are Muslims."
    <br>My prayer is that his ministry will never lack, in Jesus name. He will be moving forward and progressing.
    <br>I will go back home and tell my people in Kaduna that T.B. Joshua is real.
    <br>He brought the Emmanuel TV Partners to Kaduna State to distribute to the needy on Kano Road in Kaduna State.
    <br>I want people to believe - even if you have not gone to Lagos to see T.B. Joshua live, believe what you are seeing on Emmanuel TV
    <br>and have faith in anything he says.
    <br>My name is Gibson Samuel Ekanem. I reside at Kano road.
    <br>I really want to appreciate the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he is doing right here in Kaduna State.
    <br>My house is not far from here and I was really amazed at the run up of people.
    <br>You know, Muslims, Christians from all over came here to see what is really happening.
    <br>T.B. Joshua is giving a lot of people, most especially Muslims, bags of rice. I mean, it sounds so awesome!
    <br>I just want to appreciate the Emmanuel TV Partners and The SCOAN. I want to appreciate this man of God for what he is doing for us.
    <br>This is an expression of love. So, I just want to say thank you so much to T.B. Joshua for everything he has done.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to sing a special song to T.B. Joshua for what he is doing.
    <br>This song is specially dedicated to my father, T.B. Joshua. Let's listen.
    <br>T.B. Joshua wherever you go
    <br>May the Lord bless you so in Jesus' name
    <br>T.B. Joshua wherever you go
    <br>May the Lord bless you so every day
    <br>T.B. Joshua wherever you go
    <br>May the Lord bless you so in Jesus' name
    <br>One love, Man of God.
    <br>My name is Muhammadu Bashir. I am from Kaduna, Nigeria
    <br>This is very surprising. I was passing by when I saw what was happening here. I am so interested in what I am seeing.
    <br>I was told that a man of God was helping people with disabilities with food to eat.
    <br>I asked if the person doing this is a Muslim or a Christian. I was told he is a Christian who stays in Lagos. His name is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I sincerely pray that God will reward him. I am calling on our leaders in society both Muslims and Christians, to emulate what this man of God is doing.
    <br>We have a lot of less-privileged and disabled people in our society. They don't have anything to eat except through charity.
    <br>May God bless and reward T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>I am calling on the privileged in our society, whether Muslim, Christians, Hausa, Yoruba or Igbo to emulate T.B. Joshua and God will bless them too.
    <br>Thank you very much. I am so happy.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team have come to Kaduna to make an investment, believing that the best investment is help,
    <br>for we make a living by what we get but we make our life by what we give.
