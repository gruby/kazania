    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature and although it may not be suitable
    <br>for all viewers, it is for the glory of God .
    <br>A young boy slowly limbs into The SCOAN,
    <br>supported by a pair of crutches as can be clearly seen.
    <br>He cannot put any weight whatsoever onto his left leg.
    <br>The placard he is holding reveals why.
    <br>After sustaining an injury, a cancerous wound erupted on his leg.
    <br>The medical report reveals he has undergone two operations without success.
    <br>A closer look at the leg exposes the seriousness of the situation.
    <br>The broken bone is actually protruding out of his leg,
    <br>and a flow of cancerous fluid is coming from the wound.
    <br>This situation has obviously gone beyond the power of nature.
    <br>It has become a curse.
    <br>Who can remove a curse but God?
    <br>My name is Maria Oladiran from Cross River State, Nigeria.
    <br>The boy beside me is my son.
    <br>His name is David Oladiran.
    <br>What is the reason for you being here with your son today?
    <br>He had an accident in school while playing karate with a certain boy who hit him and he fell down.
    <br>After four days, he told us that he had a problem with his leg.
    <br>We took him to the hospital where they treated him and put bandages on him.
    <br>But after two days, the leg started swelling and after three weeks, it started opening.
    <br>Then the bone came out broken by the side and the doctor said it's a leg cancer and broken bone.
    <br>So your son now has leg cancer and a broken bone due to that injury?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We can also see that he is using crutches.
    <br>Yes because he cannot walk, do anything or go to school.
    <br>You mean without these crutches he cannot walk?
    <br>He cannot walk.
    <br>How has that affected his life?
    <br>It is affecting his education and he cannot play with his friends because he sits in one place.
    <br>I am the one that is taking care of him everyday.
    <br>What did the doctor say about his situation? Is there no solution?
    <br>They said there is no solution.
    <br>Now you are here with your son at The SCOAN, what do you believe God Almighty will do for him?
    <br>I believe that God will heal him and see us through.
    <br>Amen! We believe with you that God Almighty will heal your son, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>My name is David Oladiran and I am ten years old.
    <br>I have leg cancer and broken bone.
    <br>Now you're here at The SCOAN, what do you believe that God will do for you?
    <br>I believe that God will heal me.
    <br>Amen! We believe with you that God Almighty will heal you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>I would like to see many challenges, sicknesses, diseases and unyielding situations yield to prayer;
    <br>I want to see them yield to prayer.
    <br>The Lord said, "Okay, if that is your desire for your people and nation,
    <br>you do not want to see people sick and you want to see the sick healed
    <br>and many infirmities being cured" -
    <br>as a result of that demand, the Lord gave us this and today is the first day.
    <br>Man of God, please help me! My son's bone is out.
    <br>They played karate in the school.
    <br>Man of God, please help me, he cannot walk.
    <br>Man of God, please help me, my bone is outside.
    <br>I cannot walk.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>In the name of Jesus, you are healed.
    <br>You are healed indeed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, rise up and walk!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! The evidence of God's miracles is our rising and walking.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Master David places his weight on his left leg
    <br>and begins to walk without the aid of the crutches for the very first time since the injury.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Our Father who art in Heaven
    <br>Hallowed by Thy name
    <br>Thy Kingdom come
    <br>Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven
    <br>Give us this day our daily bread
    <br>And forgive us our trespasses
    <br>as we forgive those who trespass against us
    <br>And lead us not into temptation
    <br>but deliver us from evil
    <br>For Thine is the Kingdom and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever
    <br>We're singing, Amen.
    <br>Mrs Maria actually kept the bone which once protruded from her son's leg,
    <br>serving as undeniable evidence of the miraculous power of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People of God, praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Maria Oladiran.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was leg cancer of my son.
    <br>This happened when I was in Abuja.
    <br>We went to the hospital and they said they would amputate my son's leg.
    <br>So, my brother came to our house to greet us and he saw me crying.
    <br>He asked me if I had heard of Emmanuel TV and I said no.
    <br>Then I began to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Listen to that language! They wanted to amputate the leg.
    <br>The thought of, 'If they amputate my son's leg, he would remain with one leg'.
    <br>You know our mothers are so caring.
    <br>The thought of, 'Oh, my child will have only one leg!'
    <br>She was thinking about that before her brother came to the house.
    <br>She was told to watch Emmanuel TV, and after that she came here.
    <br>She was not even here to stop the amputation,
    <br>but to stop the pain so that the operation would be successful.
    <br>That was the reason why they came.
    <br>There is a warehouse you don't know about.
    <br>Your head has extra head.
    <br>Your leg has extra leg.
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look!
    <br>When you have a vehicle, you have spare parts such as tire, and all others.
    <br>You must have at least two each.
    <br>Just like we have president and vice president.
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>We have gone astray. That is the problem we are facing.
    <br>If this hand is injured and is about to be cut, ask God for the extra one.
    <br>He would open the warehouse and give it to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is exactly what happened. The extra leg is the one God has given to this boy.
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>Every part of our body has extra and is being kept in the warehouse.
    <br>It depends on your relationship with God.
    <br>You can only get this by dynamic faith.
    <br>Lack of dynamic faith limits what God can do through us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Lack of dynamic faith limits what God can do through us".
    <br>Little faith - pain! The next thing is that you have gone too far.
    <br>So, this boy would have had just one leg today.
    <br>Okay, let's hear from them.
    <br>That day was the day that the Morning Water came out.
    <br>They placed us on the prayer line.
    <br>That was how the man of God walked up to me and I cried, "Man of God, please help me!"
    <br>Then he walked to my side and gave me the Morning Water.
    <br>I ministered it to my son's leg and that was how it started shaking.
    <br>The man of God said that the bone would be replaced and that one would decay.
    <br>So, that was how the bone fell out
    <br>and now, I give God the glory; my son can go to school. He can play with his friends.
    <br>He can do anything on his own now.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God with Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is David Oladiran.
    <br>I am from Oyo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I reside in my mother's village in Cross River State.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was leg cancer.
    <br>I could not walk, go to school or do anything.
    <br>My mum was the person who used to assist me
    <br>and I was using crutches to walk.
    <br>We went from hospital to hospital and the doctors said that there was no solution
    <br>and that they should cut off the leg.
    <br>My mum's brother said that we should go to The SCOAN.
    <br>Then we came to The SCOAN and were placed on the prayer line.
    <br>Then Prophet T.B. Joshua gave my mother the Morning Water.
    <br>Thank you. Like I have said, I want to meet you people and to tell you about this boy -
    <br>why this miraculous thing happened.
    <br>The boy you are seeing is the crown of the house.
    <br>They should go and wait for me.
    <br>You want to play football inside the church?
    <br>Amen! Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
