    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good morning Church.
    <br>My name is Oksana Ojeba.
    <br>I am from Ukraine.
    <br>My husband is from Kogi State in Nigeria.
    <br>I have been here for 15 years.
    <br>When I was in Ukraine and I was 16 years old,
    <br>I met my husband in my country, and I saw him as a very handsome man.
    <br>Something inside me told me that he was my husband.
    <br>I was with him for five years as a friend.
    <br>When my husband finished university, he wanted to go back to Nigeria
    <br>and I was pregnant.
    <br>I begged him to marry me because the child would not be my colour
    <br>and if I was not married, no one would like my child.
    <br>After my husband married me, I said, 'Thank God'.
    <br>When my husband was in my country, he suffered.
    <br>No one gave him work; my husband was buying and selling clothes.
    <br>He was really suffering.
    <br>After I saw that my child was not happy and my husband was suffering because of colour,
    <br>I started praying to God that I would be able to bring my husband to Nigeria.
    <br>Before we came to Nigeria, my husband was very sick spiritually.
    <br>He had another woman who got pregnant for him.
    <br>The woman started disturbing him to come to her but I said no, that we should go to Nigeria.
    <br>When I got to Nigeria, I was very happy when people welcomed me.
    <br>When I got to Nigeria, I was very happy when I, my children and my husband were welcomed.
    <br>When I came, I saw that everybody wanted to play with my children.
    <br>I saw my husband's eyes became clear and he was very happy.
    <br>He was speaking a better language. I was very happy because I saw that he was free.
    <br>But later, my husband did not get work again in Nigeria.
    <br>After I gave birth to two children here, my husband started going from one woman to another.
    <br>When I saw that my husband was not happy and no one was helping him, I looked for help.
    <br>I saw a canteen woman who helped me with a job and paid me 7,000 naira.
    <br>I was washing plates and serving people.
    <br>I prayed to God to give me another job and then someone asked me to help train chicken.
    <br>I got paid 2,000 or 3,000 naira.
    <br>Nobody helped me. My daughter was hungry to the extent that she would
    <br>use a razor blade, cut herself and write on her body, 'I hate you'.
    <br>Sometimes, I would peel cassava and somebody would help me to fry gari.
    <br>I would cook and eat Nigerian food.
    <br>I want to get help from someone for my husband.
    <br>I want my husband to be happy and smile.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help my husband!
    <br>I want to thank God because when I came to The SCOAN, I had only 20,000 naira.
    <br>I did not think about where I would stay in a hotel; I only wanted to come to the church.
    <br>I asked the ushers to help me.
    <br>T.B. Joshua paid for my hotel and feeding.
    <br>I want to thank T.B. Joshua so much
    <br>because I did not sleep on the streets but in a hotel.
    <br>Mrs Oksana Ojeba - Shares Life Experience
    <br>This is my husband - my darling, my angel.
    <br>If it was not for my husband, I would not understand who God is.
    <br>He was the one who brought me to God.
    <br>This is me.
    <br>This is my son who is 26 years old.
    <br>This is me during our wedding.
    <br>So we can see in the photograph - she said this was her wedding day
    <br>and we can see her husband standing behind her.
    <br>She said that her husband is her darling husband, her angel
    <br>and she thanks God that despite the condition they are in,
    <br>he has stayed with her; they have been together and he is a loving husband to her.
    <br>These are my daughters.
    <br>This is my son.
    <br>We can see there her son - her first son on the screen there.
    <br>All of them have been living in this suffering condition for many years.
    <br>But as she has come here today to The SCOAN,
    <br>we truly believe, Madam, that your needs will be met in Christ Jesus.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Oksana Ojeba.
    <br>I am from Ukraine.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was poverty.
    <br>I got married in my country, Ukraine, to my husband who is a Nigerian.
    <br>My husband was at University in Ukraine.
    <br>When he finished university, he did not find a job.
    <br>He was selling clothes, and it was not easy for him.
    <br>I came to Nigeria and gave birth to two more children.
    <br>I could not get a job and was suffering.
    <br>I was moving up and down, begging for my children and my husband but nobody helped.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN for God to help me.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>we are here to present to you the sum of 300,000 naira
    <br>to take care of yourself, your husband and your children.
    <br>Mrs Oksana Ojeba receives 300,000 naira from the Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua to take her back home and enable her and her husband
    <br>to forget the struggles of the past and start a new life in Christ.
    <br>Thank you so much, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I thank the God of T.B. Joshua for not forgetting me and for hearing my prayers.
    <br>I want to use this money for business because this money is blessed.
    <br>I believe that with this money, my life will be better.
    <br>I will come back to give a testimony with my family.
    <br>Amen. We thank God Almighty for your life and we encourage you
    <br>you are blessed today by the Word of God
    <br>so make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Jesus Christ does not promise to keep us away from trials, tests or poverty,
    <br>but He promised to be with us and to see us through.
    <br>As God Almighty has shown you that at last, the end to your poverty has come,
    <br>the end to your problem has come,
    <br>it is time for you to live in the light of your testimony in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV.
