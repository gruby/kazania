    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>I say, "Good Morning".
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I salute your faith.
    <br>Good Morning to you!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let me quickly take you up on a message titled
    <br>GOD’S LOVE NEVER FAILS
    <br>Let's take our reading.
    <br>I will take you to different Books in the New Testament.
    <br>We will take the first reading from the Book of Romans 8 and we start our reading from verse 35 to the end.
    <br>That will be our first reading.
    <br>After that, we will go to the Book of Joshua 1:9 - it is also very key for this message.
    <br>After leaving that Book, we will also find our root in the Book of Matthew 6 from verse 25.
    <br>Our root concerning the message, "GOD'S LOVE NEVER FAILS".
    <br>That is Matthew 6:25.
    <br>When we leave there, we have other Books too that will help us - the Book of Numbers 20:8.
    <br>Let's now go to the Book of 1 Corinthians 1:8 - it will be a wonderful reading for us.
    <br>And 2 Corinthians too, chapter 12: 7-10 - it will be also very useful for us.
    <br>Take your Bible when you get home - you have enough time for this.
    <br>After listening to the message, you will be able to find more details about these Books given to you:
    <br>the Book of Joshua 1:9,
    <br>the Book of Romans 8:35 - 38 - it will be very useful showing that God's love never fails,
    <br>and the Book of Matthew - the issue of worry; it is detailed in the Book of Matthew 6:25 - very important.
    <br>And 1 Corinthians 1:18,
    <br>2 Corinthians 12:7 - 10 about Apostle Paul, the thorn; that will be very useful.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Romans first.
    <br>Life through the Spirit - Romans 8.
    <br>“Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
    <br>because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life
    <br>has set you free from the law of sin and death.”
    <br>Let's go to our proof reading - verse 35.
    <br>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
    <br>As it is written: ‘For your sake we face death all day long;
    <br>we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.’"
    <br>Verse 37.
    <br>“No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us."
    <br>38
    <br>“For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,
    <br>neither the present nor the future, nor any powers…”
    <br>Take your time and read it from verse 35 to the end.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>God's love never fails.
    <br>That Book of Romans, chapter 8 verse 35 to the end.
    <br>What can separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>Can worry?
    <br>Because this is the problem today.
    <br>When you ask your brother, he will tell you, "I'm worried. I will not be able to see T.B. Joshua before I leave today.
    <br>I'm worried; I will not be able to be prayed for.
    <br>I'm worried if I'm going to see this man one on one - I have problem" - worry.
    <br>Can worry ... - worry about what?
    <br>Families.
    <br>Can worry ... worry about present?
    <br>Can worry ... worry about the future?
    <br>What can separate you?
    <br>Can worry, worry about your work responsibilities... "How will I go about it?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can worry ... worry about your weight?
    <br>Many people complain about their weight, "I'm too fat..." - worry about weight.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Worry, worry, worry...
    <br>The list of worries is endless.
    <br>"I'm dark in complexion; I want to bleach my colour.
    <br>I have an oblong face; I need a round face.
    <br>My nose is too small; I want to operate it.
    <br>I want to add more to my 'bum bum'."
    <br>Worry, worry, worry...
    <br>"There are so many gaps in my teeth; I need to operate it.
    <br>Look at what the man of God wears today; I need this suit."
    <br>After the break you go to the car-park, you look around at different kinds of cars,
    <br>"My God, I need this jeep."
    <br>Worry, worry, worry...
    <br>Worry interferes with God’s Spirit in our life.
    <br>Worry interferes with God’s Spirit and you need God’s Spirit.
    <br>"I want to add to my hair, I need some wig."
    <br>Worry, worry, worry...
    <br>Each time you look in the mirror, you have something to worry about,
    <br>because of the way you look and the way others look.
    <br>Worry, worry...
    <br>The list of worries is endless.
    <br>Despite all these worries, God’s love for us remains unfailing.
    <br>The reality is this: We all experience worry, including me.
    <br>Ask me what is my worry.
    <br>You – how you will get Heaven because of inconsistency.
    <br>Because Jesus will come like a thief in the night.
    <br>No one knows when and how.
    <br>Where will you be?
    <br>If I know you today, I may not know you tomorrow.
    <br>If you are with me today, you may not be with me tomorrow.
    <br>Where will you be?
    <br>Will you be ready when the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>Worries interfere with God’s Spirit in our life.
    <br>Many are here, but they are not here because of worry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We all experience worry.
    <br>Worry about present, worry about our future, worry about failure.
    <br>Even the great heroes of our faith experienced their own share of worry about failure.
    <br>That is why I give you those Books to read.
    <br>Don't forget to add Genesis 20:1-end to the Books I gave you to read.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Even the great heroes of our faith experienced their own share of failure.
    <br>Abraham, Moses, Elijah, John, Peter, Paul -
    <br>they all knew what it was like to make serious mistakes
    <br>but God used even their mistakes to bring them to the place where He wanted them to be.
    <br>Because God never created failure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “I want to be the person You created, oh Lord.”
    <br>He never created failure; there is no failure in Him.
    <br>Say, “I want to be the person You created”.
    <br>Today, everybody desires breakthrough.
    <br>Today, everybody desires success,
    <br>whereas disappointment sometimes serves to keep us for success.
    <br>Failure sometimes serves to keep us from breakthrough.
    <br>Setback sometimes serves to keep us for the future we desire.
    <br>God used their failure to bring them to the place where He wanted them to be, the place of honour.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In that reading given to you, you will find that
    <br>Abraham failed God when he fled to Egypt during the drought.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Moses lost his temper and turned to violence more than once.
    <br>He lost his temper.
    <br>Are you talking of David?
    <br>He committed murder and adultery.
    <br>Peter denied Jesus Christ
    <br>and yet the Lord used all the people who failed Him.
    <br>No matter how many times you fail, His love never does.
    <br>There are many successful people out there in our society all over the world
    <br>that have once had the same experience you are going through -
    <br>failure, setback, sickness, disease but today, God has changed their story.
    <br>Ask successful people out there; they will tell you how much disappointment they have endured,
    <br>how much sickness they have endured, how much failure they have endured,
    <br>how much stagnation they have endured
    <br>to come to their breakthrough, to the place of honour, the future they deserve.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Reason well as a Christian – you will see why you are going through the challenges you have.
    <br>Do what?
    <br>With deep reflection, you will see why you are going through the challenges.
    <br>With deep reflection, you will see why you are going through the situation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It takes faith to realise that our situation is a mere stopping interval,
    <br>a short break between two events.
    <br>It takes faith, not experience we use today -
    <br>because you have gone all over the world, you are well educated.
    <br>No, not experience – faith.
    <br>It takes faith to realise that our situation is a mere stopping interval – a transit point to connect.
    <br>Not your destination – it is a preparation to success.
    <br>Not your destination – it is a bridge to success.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[What is your situation?]
    <br>I cannot heart you.
    <br>[What is your situation?]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[What is your situation?]
    <br>I cannot heart you.
    <br>[What is your situation?]
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>Is it inability to get a job in spite of your qualifications?
    <br>Is it inability to get a job?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What are you going through, what are the challenges?
    <br>The great heroes of our faith had their own share of challenges
    <br>and God used their challenges to bring them to the place where He wanted them to be.
    <br>With deep reflection, you will see reason why you are going through your challenges.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Challenge is not a crisis; it’s a friend.
    <br>It’s a bridge; it’s a preparation.
    <br>It’s a stopping interval; it’s not a crisis.
    <br>Lord, in spite of our weaknesses, in spite of our failure, help us to learn from them.
    <br>It is a school of lessons.
    <br>Your challenge is a school of lessons but you don’t look at it that way.
    <br>You look at it as a crisis.
    <br>Where will you learn?
    <br>That is the best college, which is better than the one you go to out there.
    <br>Challenges are the best college to learn how to handle your future.
    <br>You have to learn once and for all from your challenges
    <br>and get connected to the future you deserve.
    <br>It’s a bridge; get connected.
    <br>Learn and get connected.
    <br>If not, it will be throwback.
    <br>Many challenges you are facing today, and you are not supposed to.
    <br>You have someone helping you to push your challenges somewhere,
    <br>not in a normal way, but it is there to push it somewhere.
    <br>You know this thing is not right for you.
    <br>You get it at all cost because you have somebody to help you - but it will be throwback.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It will become a carry-over to our life.
    <br>Finally, this is a word of exhortation:
    <br>What we see as a failure is not failure at all from eternity’s perspective – from God’s angle.
    <br>What we see as a failure is not failure at all.
    <br>What we see as a failure is not failure at all from eternity’s perspective.
    <br>Jesus’ death on the Cross – His disciples at first thought it was failure
    <br>but what looked like a failure brought new life to all mankind.
    <br>Look at the case of Peter at the seaside, "I will make you a fisher of men, if you follow Me".
    <br>From disappointment to what?
    <br>Don't forget about Hannah; at what age...?
    <br>Worry about money, worry about relationships, worry about work responsibilities,
    <br>worry about someone who disappointed you -
    <br>all those things are a trap of the enemy to interfere with God’s Spirit in your life.
    <br>Once you are worried, nothing can work here;
    <br>nothing, even the Spirit of God cannot - nothing, you are for satan when you are worried.
    <br>At the moment you start worrying, you are a servant of satan.
    <br>If I am worried, I will not come here.
    <br>I would not be able to come here
    <br>and if I force myself to come here, I would not be able to represent God here today.
    <br>Worry can cause hypertension, heart attack, blood pressure; just name those things worry can cause,
    <br>my dear brother.
    <br>It interferes with God's Spirit in our life.
    <br>Worry, worry, worry...
    <br>You don’t have to worry
    <br>And don’t you be afraid
    <br>Joy comes in the morning
    <br>Troubles they won’t last always
    <br>Remember there’s a Friend named Jesus
    <br>Who will wipe your tears away
    <br>And if your heart is broken
    <br>Just lift your hands and say
    <br>I know that I can make it
    <br>I know that I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>With Jesus I can take it
    <br>With Him I know I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>You don’t have to worry
    <br>And don’t you be afraid
    <br>Joy comes in the morning
    <br>Troubles they won’t last always
    <br>Remember there’s a Friend named Jesus
    <br>Who will wipe your tears away
    <br>And if your heart is broken
    <br>Just lift your hands and say
    <br>I know that I can make it
    <br>I know that I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>With Jesus I can take it
    <br>With Him I know I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>What you see as a failure may not be at all – stop worrying.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Something that stands as a preparation, a bridge – can we call it a crisis?
    <br>Can we call preparation a crisis?
    <br>Can we call a bridge a crisis?
    <br>Can we call a stopping interval a crisis?
    <br>Can we call a transit point a crisis?
    <br>Can we call getting connected a crisis?
    <br>That are the challenges.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever challenges you are going through, whether sickness,
    <br>all you need – you need to be a Christian.
    <br>Once you are a Christian, your challenges are not like others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Listen!
    <br>Once you are a Christian, your sickness is not like others.
    <br>Your sickness is to preserve you, to keep you for a new level.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile.
    <br>When you are stopped awhile, it is time to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Once you have whatever sickness,
    <br>or challenge that could be stagnation, joblessness, barrenness, loneliness...
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot get sick
    <br>but your sickness is not like others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot get sick
    <br>but your sickness is not like others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you face your neighbour and tell:
    <br>That I am a Christian does not mean I cannot face challenges,
    <br>does not mean I cannot face situations but my challenges, my situations are not like others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Others, their situation is to destroy them, to kill them, to wreck them, to sink them
    <br>but your own situation – you just need to be one with Jesus.
    <br>If anyone tells you that as a Christian, you cannot get sick, that is a wrong doctrine.
    <br>Where do you put Apostle Paul?
    <br>“When I am weak, then I am strong.”
    <br>When you are sick, then you are in good health.
    <br>When you are sick, then you are healed.
    <br>When you are stuck, then you are moving.
    <br>When you have failed, then you have success.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lesson, lesson, lesson; you need to grow.
    <br>Everyone; as I am here now, I need to grow more.
    <br>And to grow...
    <br>The best lesson, the best examination for growing is challenges.
    <br>You learn better in challenges.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What we see as failure may not be from eternity’s perspective.
    <br>That your sickness, that your failure, that your setback, delayed pregnancy,
    <br>whatever you call it that you are facing does not mean you are not a Christian.
    <br>Don’t allow your situation to rule you, to dictate to you whether you are a Christian or not.
    <br>“Because I am poor, I am not a Christian.”
    <br>A man can be poor and yet be a friend of Jesus.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God’s love never fails.
    <br>The trap satan sets out there now for Christians is worry.
    <br>When the people of the world realise that you are happy, they dial your number,
    <br>"What can I tell this person? He is too happy."
    <br>"Hello. I had a very bad dream about you. Once I dreamt about this person and it happened,
    <br>and I dreamt about this person and it happened..."
    <br>By the time he has given you 5 good examples,
    <br>you will start urinating.
    <br>- "I dreamt about this, that. Go and ask..."
    <br>- "How can I see you?"
    <br>- "See me? OK, come."
    <br>Because he knows you are happy, he wants to make you sad, worried.
    <br>By then, he might have gathered some information about you.
    <br>Just to make you worried.
    <br>Worry interferes with God’s Spirit in your life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Worry interferes with God’s Spirit in our life.
    <br>Once you are worried...
    <br>If I'm worried now, and I stretch my hand to say, "Be healed!", I'm talking to myself.
    <br>No healing; nothing.
    <br>If I just go there and say, "Be healed!", I'm hearing myself and you are hearing me, but God...
    <br>I would be hearing myself and you around me would be hearing me, but God...
    <br>Because I'm what?
    <br>I'm worried.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Those of you that wake up in the morning; you want to make your husband worried, your wife worried,
    <br>somebody worried; on the phone, you are good in giving negative news.
    <br>Worry, worry, worry...
    <br>I want to leave you here.
    <br>I know you have a lot of lessons to learn today.
    <br>How will you deal with worry?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How will you deal with worry?"
    <br>Little, little...
    <br>Thank you.
