    <br>Whatever hinders your miracle, give way, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>I say, leave my people!

    <br>The problem that brought me here was heart and chest pain.
    <br>I went to the hospital; the doctor said I had an infection.
    <br>For over four years, I had a virus.
    <br>It disturbed me for a long time.
    <br>I could not sleep; I could not even live with people.
    <br>Ok. Do you want to sleep?
    <br>Sleep!
    <br>Falls Asleep After Being Healed Of Heart & Chest

    <br>He has risen from the dead
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Every knee shall bow
    <br>Every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Joy Bongos.
    <br>I am a Nigerian. I come from Kano.
    <br>The problem that brought me here to The SCOAN was a virus and the left-hand side of my chest.
    <br>For more than four years, I have been coughing - no sleeping, no solution.
    <br>I went to many places, to many doctors; yet, there was no solution.
    <br>I even went to traditionalistis to get herbal medicine.
    <br>I took it; yet, there was no solution.
    <br>To the extent that my sisters used to call me 'church prostitute'.
    <br>They called me 'church prostitute' because anywhere they said there was healing taking place,
    <br>I would rush there but yet, there was still no solution.
    <br>I suffered with this. If I was in public, I would be coughing, coughing - no control.
    <br>If I was in the church, I would be coughing; in fact I would not stop.
    <br>When I started coughing, I would hold my stomach and chest so that I could cough.
    <br>If I did not hold this area, I could not cough; it would be paining me.
    <br>So, last Sunday, I was here, sitting up there on the gallery.
    <br>The man of God was touching people down here.
    <br>I said, "Oh my God, why will the man of God not come up and touch me?"
    <br>People were telling me that I was funny.
    <br>After thirty minutes, I said, "Oh God, let the man of God come up".
    <br>I sat down but the Spirit came to me and told me that I should claim it.
    <br>So whenever the man of God was healing people, I would be claiming, "I am healed".
    <br>Whenever he touched someone - whether it was the same sickness I had or not, I would say, "I am healed".
    <br>During the Mass Prayer he started praying for people.
    <br>Then he said that any thing that was in our liver, we should vomit it out.
    <br>I was sitting there; I felt dizzy and then I started vomiting.
    <br>I started vomiting where I sat.
    <br>Then the ushers came and told me, "Come here and vomit".
    <br>That was how I got recorded.
    <br>When I was vomiting, I didn't even know that I was vomiting blood.
    <br>All of a sudden, I just vomited blood; I don't know what happened.
    <br>Let me tell you in short, my dear brethren:
    <br>When I was vomiting, it was like someone was using a broom to sweep my heart.
    <br>Everywhere was just sweeping; I was just continuously vomiting blood.
    <br>When the man of God asked me to sleep, I didn't know I fell asleep.
    <br>When I was sleeping, something was going out of body; it was just moving in my body.
    <br>I started stretching my hand and turned and after I turned, I coughed and vomited again.
    <br>Some blood also came out after the man of God had asked me to sleep.
    <br>That very Sunday, I went back home.
    <br>Before, I could not sleep without rubbing garlic on my body.
    <br>If I did not rub garlic on my body, I would feel cold and start coughing.
    <br>I also kept water beside me 24/7.
    <br>That night, I also kept water beside me  in case I would vomit or cough.
    <br>But I slept like a baby - I didn't cough, I didn't rub the garlic;
    <br>I didn't do anything; I just slept till daybreak.
    <br>When I woke up, I said, "The God of T.B. Joshua has done it. Finally, I will not cough again".
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>It was amazing. On Monday, I slept very well, fine.
    <br>Then on Tuesday afternoon, something happened.
    <br>Some people say they used to dream at night.
    <br>But my own dream came in the afternoon, to show that the power of God is in this church.
    <br>When I was sleeping on Tuesday afternoon, I saw the man of God in my dream.
    <br>He told me, "Come". I asked him, "Who are you?"
    <br>Then he said, "Look at me very well".
    <br>I turned and looked at him. I saw him and said, "Daddy, you are the one!"
    <br>He said, "Yes. Come and follow me".
    <br>I follow him. He went to the other room and opened the door.
    <br>He said, "What do you see there?" I said, "I see a chain".
    <br>Those chains were just tightening - very tight.
    <br>He started breaking the chains in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>When he broke the chain, he gave me the key.
    <br>He said, "Take this key. This is the room that tied your destiny. Now it is over!
    <br>I shouted, "God, thank You! Jesus, thank You!"
    <br>Then he told me, "Just stand. You will see three men coming.
    <br>Two men, one woman. You will see what will happen".
    <br>When they came, they saw me and started running away.
    <br>I said, "What brought you here?" They said, "There is fire on your body!
    <br>There is fire! We cannot come close to you again! We cannot do it again!"
    <br>That was how they ran away.
    <br>Then the man of God said in that very dream, "Get up! Vomit again!"
    <br>I vomited again - not in the dream, I woke up and vomited again.
    <br>And that was the final?
    <br>That was the fina!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>Now I am ok. I give God the glory.
    <br>I thank the man of God and the Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>because without the help of prayer, we cannot function.
    <br>I believe that God who healed me will heal others, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So, madam, you can sleep well now.
    <br>Yes, I can sleep very well now.
    <br>Ever since that very day.
    <br>For over four years, I could not sleep but I slept.
    <br>The sleep that I did not sleep for four years, I slept enough - more than the four years.
    <br>My dear brethren, you should believe in God.
    <br>Some other people will say, if the man of God did not touch me, they will not come to church.
    <br>Why? It's not like that. When you have faith in you -
    <br>you can even see that from the television, many people are healed.
    <br>So when you have faith, everything becomes very possible for you.
    <br>You just claim it. Especially as the man of God was saying,
    <br>"When I am praying for others, you should claim it". Claim it like that.
    <br>Don't say that it is not your way or not the same sickness you have. No.
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>Every time I would say, "God, You have healed others. One day, You are going to heal me".
    <br>And I found out today that I am healed.
    <br>As I am healed, everyone else is also going to be healed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
