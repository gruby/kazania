    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer And Deliverance In Jesusâ€™ Name
    <br>As a communicator between the visible and the invisible,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>to international visitors who have travelled from all over the world
    <br>to experience the supernatural move of God in their lives
    <br>through God's grace in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Let's watch as the powers of darkness in the life of this young man are exposed.
    <br>What is he doing? Do you preach the Gospel?
    <br>I was preaching five months ago but I stopped.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come. Come on.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>You possess evil powers.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because right from a small age, the spirit of man entered you.
    <br>It's true, man of God.
    <br>Spirit of man.
    <br>Yes. It's true.
    <br>You don't have women; it's men.
    <br>Yes. It's true.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Deliverance takes place as Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to pray for him in Jesus' name.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>He's free.
    <br>Later in the Sunday service, during the mass prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the same young man vomits poisonous substances and he is set free completely in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado 
    <br>Buenos Aires, Argentina
    <br>I am 29 years old and I am studying Law in Argentina.
    <br>He said that his name is Marcelo. He is from Argentina.
    <br>He is 29 years old and he is here to give thanks to God.
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Last Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.
    <br>During the prayer, he prophesied that a spirit of man entered into me from a young age.
    <br>He said that last week, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for him and prophesied to him,
    <br>saying that a spirit of man entered him from a young age.
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>He asked if I was a pastor or a preacher and I replied that yes, I used to be one.
    <br>He asked me if I used to preach and I said, "Yes, I used to preach before".
    <br>I grew up in a Christian family with uncles who were pastors and evangelists.
    <br>At the age of five, a family member abused me.
    <br>He said that he grew up in a Christian family. His parents, his uncles were pastors.
    <br>When he was five years old, he was raped by a male member of his family.
    <br>That was the beginning of emotional and spiritual suffering.
    <br>This spirit began to dominate my mind and my emotions with inclination towards the male sex.
    <br>He said that from that moment, this spirit entered him and his life became suffering.
    <br>He lost any affection for the opposite sex and just began to feel affection for men like him.
    <br>At the age of 12, I had my first relationship with a man who was older than me.
    <br>When he was 12 years old, he had his first sexual relationship with a man that was older than him.
    <br>I felt no affection for the opposite female sex.
    <br>He said he didn't feel any affection towards the female sex.
    <br>As I grew up with my family in the church, I was preaching and searching for God.
    <br>I loved God but there was always a struggle inside me that I had ended up losing.
    <br>He said that during this time, he grew up in a church.
    <br>He was even trying to preach in the church but he felt so guilty
    <br>and there was always a struggle inside of him.
    <br>I thought that there was no solution to the problem I was experiencing.
    <br>Despite praying, fasting and reading the Bible, I was never able to be free from this spirit.
    <br>He said he kept trying to be free from this spirit but he could not.
    <br>He read the Bible; he tried to pray; he tried to go to different churches.
    <br>There was no solution. He could not receive freedom from this spirit.
    <br>I decided to abandon the church and stop praying and reading my Bible.
    <br>I started to enter into the world of darkness, going to the night clubs,
    <br>joining the occult and taking drugs.
    <br>He said that it got to a point where it was so bad that he decided to abandon the church.
    <br>He decided to go into the world. He started drinking, taking drugs, going to discos, going to clubs.
    <br>In the Law faculty where I was studying, I developed an obsession for a young man.
    <br>The obsession was so much that I went to the internet to acquire powers to seduce him.
    <br>He said he was studying Law at the university
    <br>and there was one boy in his class that he became obsessed with.
    <br>In order to seduce him, he decided to go to the internet to get evil powers.
    <br>I did a covenant with a spirit called 'Eros' which gave me evil powers
    <br>just as Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied that I had evil powers.
    <br>It is true. I had power in my eyes, power in my mouth to seduce and in my mind to control.
    <br>So just like Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied that I had evil powers - it is true.
    <br>I went to the internet and did a pact, a covenant with a god called 'Eros'.
    <br>It is like a god of love.
    <br>And he said that after that, he gained powers -
    <br>power in his eyes and in his mouth to seduce and in his mind to control.
    <br>Once in the bus coming back from university, I saw a man that I liked
    <br>and with just one look, I seduced him and he gave me his number.
    <br>Prophecy and Deliverance Testimony
    <br>He said that these powers gave him that ability to seduce men.
    <br>And as soon as he started using them, men would follow him and
    <br>he would initiate them and sleep with them.
    <br>Let me ask my friend: How are you feeling now after the prayer on last Sunday?
    <br>Can you share your experience after that prayer on Sunday. What followed?
    <br>When the Prophet called me and said I should stand up,
    <br>I automatically felt as if my feet were not on the ground.
    <br>The Prophet said I should come and I can't remember everything that happened
    <br>but I felt like an electric shock in my body and my stomach turned upside down.
    <br>He said that when the Prophet prayed for him, he felt as if he was walking on the air.
    <br>His feet were not on the ground.
    <br>He felt like an electric shock came through his body.
    <br>After the prayer of the Prophet, I felt like a huge burden was lifted from me.
    <br>A bondage of years was removed forever.
    <br>He said that after the prayer, this spirit has left him forever.
    <br>The feeling, urge towards men and all other - he should tell us what happened to them after the prayer.
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>After the man of God prayed for me, it is strange but I look at women and find them beautiful.
    <br>He said that after the prayer, now he doesn't feel that affection for men.
    <br>Now when he sees women, he can appreciate that they are beautiful.
    <br>Hm ... hm.
    <br>Wait ... wait.
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>He said that he appreciates women now and now he sees a man as a man.
    <br>Does he mean that there is no urge towards men again?
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Before, it was normal for me to have affection for men
    <br>but when I discovered Prophet T.B. Joshua on YouTube, I realised that it was an evil spirit.
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>He said that after the prayer, now he can see a man and
    <br>he doesn't feel that attraction towards them like before.
    <br>He said that he discovered Prophet T.B. Joshua on YouTube
    <br>and that's when he realised that this spirit was actually an evil spirit.
    <br>It wasn't normal to feel that attraction for men.
    <br>Now, I don't feel any affection for the male sex. I am not attracted to them at all.
    <br>He said that now he can look at men and he doesn't have any attraction.
    <br>He doesn't feel any sexual attraction towards them at all.
    <br>But seeing women - how do you appreciate women now?
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Now, I look at women and see them as beautiful.
    <br>He said that when he sees women now, he can see that they are beautiful
    <br>and he can appreciate them that they are really pretty and beautiful now.
    <br>Anywhere you are, women, clap for Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Well, this is Jesus for you.
    <br>Can you just give your advice to the world. What advice do you have for the whole world?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>This is a spiritual problem and requires a spiritual  solution.
    <br>I pray that my testimony reaches those who are struggling with what I struggled with.
    <br>It is not normal; it is spiritual and spiritual problems are only solved by the Spirit.
    <br>He said that his advice is that this problem is a spiritual problem.
    <br>Therefore, it needs a spiritual solution.
    <br>The people that are suffering from this same spirit that he had -
    <br>the answer for them is to receive a spiritual solution which is deliverance.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So now, you are free. You are completely free within and outside you.
    <br>Marcelo Maldonado - Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Amen! Yes, I am totally free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>He said: "Yes, I am totally free, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Thank you, Lord.
    <br>Give thanks to God!
    <br>Waive your hand and say, "Thank you, Lord!"
