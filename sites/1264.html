    <br>My name is Brother Chris, by the grace of God.
    <br>I'm from the UK.
    <br>I thank God for the wonderful privilege and honour to be here in your midst today.
    <br>I thank God for the life of His servant Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>who God used to mentor me, to guide me, to be in your midst this morning
    <br>to proclaim the wonderful news of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, it is just two days to Christmas.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Merry Christmas!"
    <br>Like I mentioned before, I'm from the UK.
    <br>In the UK, we take Christmas very seriously - it is a serious issue.
    <br>Unfortunately, we don't take Christ very seriously.
    <br>I wish we would take Christ as seriously as we take Christmas.
    <br>But nevertheless, Christmas, we take it very seriously in the UK.
    <br>I believe around the world - different cultures, customs, communities -
    <br>we have our way of celebrating Christmas.
    <br>In the UK, we have many traditions and ceremonies attached to Christmas.
    <br>I just want to share with you a very quick story.
    <br>This is a true story - Christmas story.
    <br>Just to set the tone for today's message.
    <br>Now, one of the traditions on Christmas in the UK is that we have nativity plays.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by that?
    <br>In your school, the children will reenact the story of Jesus
    <br>when Jesus was born - it is called a nativity play.
    <br>Every year, without fail, your school must hold that nativity play
    <br>where they have Mary and Joseph and baby Jesus.
    <br>They go to the inn, they say, "There is no room in the inn".
    <br>They are taken finally to the manger, the stable.
    <br>She gives birth to baby Jesus.
    <br>We all know the story of Christmas.
    <br>We all know the story of Jesus.
    <br>Now, picture this. This was a nativity play that I attended.
    <br>These were little children.
    <br>It got to the part of the story where the sheperds and the wise men came to see Jesus
    <br>at the manger when he had just been born.
    <br>You guys know the story very well.
    <br>You know the story well?
    <br>Good. So I don't need to repeat to you the details of the story.
    <br>It got to the part where the three wise men who had travelled thousands of miles
    <br>to come and honour Jesus who had just been born.
    <br>They came to present their gifts.
    <br>Just picture this.
    <br>Three little kids are the three wise men, dressed in their robes and regalia to show they are wise men.
    <br>The first one walks forward and says, "We are wise men to see Jesus.
    <br>Here is the gift of gold".
    <br>Drops the gold; then walks back.
    <br>The second wise man comes forward - "And myrrh."
    <br>Drops it; walks back.
    <br>The third wise man, the little boy walks forward.
    <br>And he forgets his line.
    <br>I don't know whether you have ever been in that moment; it's very painful.
    <br>You know the family, the parents, everyone is there watching.
    <br>And the little boy just forgot his line.
    <br>Everyone was trying to - "Will you remember..."
    <br>Trying to get him remember the line.
    <br>The boy was worried; he was scared.
    <br>Everybody was tense.
    <br>In Nigeria, we would say, "Wahala don't come". That is the situation.
    <br>Everyone was tense, worried, "What is going to happen?"
    <br>Suddenly, the little boy remembered.
    <br>With a smile, he walks forward and says, "And Frank sent this".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>He walked forward, he forgot the line and said, "And Frank sent this".
    <br>Instead of "frankincense".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, I'm just trying to set the scene for today's message, the Christmas message.
    <br>But on a more serious note:
    <br>Today, we so often celebrate the tradition and ceremony of Christmas
    <br>and our focus is more on the story of the Baby Jesus, the story of the Christ of history,
    <br>the story of the Christ of song, the Christmas carols
    <br>and we overlook the reason for Christmas.
    <br>So I want to encourage you today:
    <br>Don't get so carried away by the ceremony of Christmas that you forget the reason for Christmas.
    <br>We should never allow the tradition of Christmas to overshadow our relationship with Jesus
    <br>because Jesus is the centre of Christmas.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, Jesus is the centre of Christmas".
    <br>Without Jesus, there would be no Christmas.
    <br>Viewers around the world, today, we want to celebrate Jesus at Christmas.
    <br>Not just the Baby Jesus or the Christ of history, story, song,
    <br>the one we sing about in the Christmas carols.
    <br>We want to celebrate Jesus Christ revealed by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>And this will bring us to the title of today's message:
    <br>O COME LET US ADORE HIM
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, Christmas is all about Jesus".
    <br>Now, you may have observed that the title of today's message
    <br>comes from a very well known Christmas carol.
    <br>You know the song, "O come let us adore Him"?
    <br>I'm not hearing you; do you know it?
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>Alright because we are going to sing it right now. Let's give it a go.
    <br>O come let us adore Him
    <br>O come let us adore Him
    <br>Christ the Lord
    <br>Put your hands together for yourselves.
    <br>Put your hands together.
    <br>Let's just try this - men first; all the men, are you ready?
    <br>All the men - are you ready?
    <br>Ok, let's go.
    <br>O come let us adore Him
    <br>O come let us adore Him
    <br>Christ the Lord
    <br>Alright, the women now; the females - let's go.
    <br>O come let us adore Him
    <br>O come let us adore Him
    <br>Christ the Lord
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may then have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>I love the simple melody and the simple words, the simple truth of that carol.
    <br>O come let us adore Him
    <br>It's all about Jesus.
    <br>Today, the world is trying to commercialise Christmas.
    <br>They want to turn it to be about shopping, food and fun; just festivities.
    <br>Yet, Christmas is about those things but more importantly, it's about Jesus.
    <br>It's not about you, it's not about us - it's all about Him.
    <br>Unfortunately, many people when they sing that carol, in their hearts, there is a different song.
    <br>Some hearts are singing: "O come let us adore me.
    <br>O come let us adore me. Chris the Lord".
    <br>Why? - Because they are so focused on themselves.
    <br>Christmas to them is all about how they can enjoy the flesh,
    <br>enjoy the material things of this world.
    <br>Once again, brethren, I want to redirect your focus to who Christmas is all about -
    <br>it's all about Jesus.
    <br>If there was ever a time to celebrate and to acknowledge
    <br>and to revisit the love of God for us, this is the time.
    <br>So turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of 1 John 4.
    <br>We just want to use this Christmas season
    <br>as an opportunity to remind ourselves of how much Jesus loves us.
    <br>1 John 4:9 and it says:
    <br>"This is how God showed His love among us:
    <br>He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him."
    <br>Verse 10.
    <br>"This is love: not that we loved God,
    <br>but that He loved us and His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
    <br>Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another."
    <br>Now.
    <br>In today's world, in our generation today,
    <br>if you look at the crises, the trouble, the turmoil in the world,
    <br>many people ask themselves the question, "Does God really love me?"
    <br>And that is one of satan's tactics.
    <br>One of satan's tactics is to try and get you to doubt God's love and goodness.
    <br>You begin to say, "All the trouble going on in the world, the evil happening,
    <br>the terrible things that are taking place" -
    <br>you just look around you, there is so much trouble,
    <br>there is political trouble, economic trouble, religious trouble.
    <br>I mean, we are in a world that is full of trouble.
    <br>And because of that, many hearts have grown cold to Jesus.
    <br>Many people's love has grown cold; their hearts have been hardened.
    <br>They become cynical, sceptical when it comes to Jesus or the things of God.
    <br>"You live, let me live.
    <br>I live my life, you live your life because look at what is happening in the world.
    <br>Where is God in the midst of this? Where is God in the midst of the sorrow?
    <br>Where is God in the midst of the trouble? Where is God in the midst of the trials?"
    <br>So, viewers, I want to encourage you today and challenge you today.
    <br>I don't know what situation you may be facing
    <br>that may be causing you to doubt God's love.
    <br>Perhaps, you are facing relentless troubles, hurtful hard times.
    <br>Perhaps, you are facing hatred, hunger or homelessness.
    <br>Perhaps, it is painful persecution.
    <br>You may be facing betrayal by your friends, family.
    <br>Or worse yet, your own awful sin.
    <br>But one thing I do know, one thing I'm assured of:
    <br>There is nothing, not one thing that is evil enough,
    <br>ugly enough, deep enough, powerful enough to stop God from loving you.
    <br>Nothing!
    <br>Nothing anyone could do to you could possibly sever that connection,
    <br>could dam the unstoppable, undeniable, unconditional love of God.
    <br>You can ignore God, you can reject Him, you can slander Him
    <br>but His love for you remains constant and unchanging.
    <br>No matter how many times we fail, God's love never does.
    <br>No matter how many times we fall, God's love never does.
    <br>No matter how many times we falter, God's love never does.
    <br>Apostle Paul said, "I am convinced that neither death nor life,
    <br>neither angels nor demons, neither the past nor the present, neither height nor depth,
    <br>nothing in this world can separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, my Lord".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, God loves you as much as He does any of His children".
    <br>He loves you. Some of us begin to say, "Maybe God chose partiality;
    <br>this guy - He loves him more than me. He is showing favouritism". No!
    <br>The Father has no favourites.
    <br>There are no lucky ones in the Lord, no pets of Divinity.
    <br>He loves us.
    <br>Some people may be saying, "Why? How can we reconcile the two -
    <br>the troubles and the turmoil in the world and a loving, good God?"
    <br>I want to assure you, brethren.
    <br>God has not left us, abandoned us or closed the door on us;
    <br>we are the ones that have left Him.
    <br>God has not left us; He is with us.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>That is our greeting in The SCOAN.
    <br>The question is: Are you with Him?
    <br>Because we easily stray from God and then question Him when our lives begin to go up and down.
    <br>Once again, brethren, this Christmas season is an opportunity
    <br>for you to realise how much God loves you.
    <br>God so loved the world that He gave His only Son.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua explains, "God has a Son and He planted Him in the earth
    <br>to produce a family.
    <br>Today, millions are born again because of His best Seed".
    <br>That is why we are here today in the presence of God, celebrating His birth.
    <br>Millions are born-again because of His best Seed.
    <br>God gave us His best at Christmas.
    <br>Love was born at Christmas.
    <br>When you celebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmas, you are celebrating His love,
    <br>His joy, faithfulness, goodness, forgiveness.
    <br>Remember, by His love, we love.
    <br>In His love, we have a newness of life.
    <br>Through His love, we become a new man.
    <br>Jesus came to restore that relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>That is why He came.
    <br>I want to challenge you today; it is a two-pronged message.
    <br>It is both a reminder of how much God loves you
    <br>and as a challenge to ask yourself, "How much do you love Him?"
    <br>What is your relationship with Him like?
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do,
    <br>is not the services we attend, the prayers we pray,
    <br>the tithes, the offerings we drop.
    <br>I'm not saying they are not part of Christianity; they are all good but that is not the main thing.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do but the relationship we maintain
    <br>and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>This means that nothing is more important than our relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, nothing is more important than my relationship with Jesus".
    <br>Ask yourself today, "Is there anything in your life that is more important than Jesus?"
    <br>Just challenge yourself, "Is there anything in my life that is more important than Jesus?"
    <br>Jesus was asked in Matthew 22, "What is the greatest commandment?"
    <br>Jesus responded, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
    <br>all your mind, all your soul and all your strength".
    <br>Love God above all.
    <br>That is the summary of the Scriptures.
    <br>Love Him above all.
    <br>This Christmas, challenge yourself.
    <br>As you go about celebrating the birth of Jesus,
    <br>ask yourself, "Do I love God above all or is He just one of those things that are important to me?"
    <br>God is the only reason; not one of these things.
    <br>I'm going to try and very simply do an example to practicalise this.
    <br>Let me get four volunteers.
    <br>One volunteer from here - any one volunteer.
    <br>Any one volunteer, you can just come forward.
    <br>Alright, sir, thank you very much.
    <br>Sir, you come and stand here.
    <br>I need one volunteer from here.
    <br>Our brother is instantly ready. You stand here.
    <br>I need another volunteer from here.
    <br>If God puts it in your heart, just come out.
    <br>Brilliant. That is three.
    <br>One more from here.
    <br>Ok, you can just come out. Wonderful.
    <br>So this is a very simple example and I want you to question yourself.
    <br>You sir, congratulations, you are going to represent God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>God is "Thank You, Jesus" - wonderful.
    <br>Our brother is going to represent God; it's a wonderful role.
    <br>You sir, it is still a good role but not quite up to God.
    <br>You are going to represent Mr Money.
    <br>You are Mr Money, okay?
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Okay, wonderful.
    <br>Here is Mr Money - money.
    <br>You sir, are going to represent Mr Social Relations - friends, family, well-wishers, etc.
    <br>You sir, are going to represent Mr Position.
    <br>So we have God, we have Mr Money,
    <br>we have Mr Social Relations and we have Mr Position.
    <br>Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>I'm not hearing you - are you with me, people of God?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Ok, so come, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>First of all, I want to show you how a Christian life should look.
    <br>God is not one of these things.
    <br>You can't compare Him to position, you can't compare Him to friends or family and
    <br>you can't compare Him to money.
    <br>God is not one of these things.
    <br>God is the only thing, the only reason.
    <br>Jesus is THE Way, not a way.
    <br>So in my journey through life, let's just say, I meet Mr Money here.
    <br>And Mr Money offers me some investment advice.
    <br>Sir, just tell me about a proposal that will involve money.
    <br>I want to give you 10 million US dollars, what are you going to do with it?
    <br>Wow, thank You, Jesus! 10 million! This is awesome!
    <br>Now, as a Christian, do you know what I'm supposed to do?
    <br>Immediately I hear from Mr Money, what do I do?
    <br>I go back to God and confirm from Him the step to take!
    <br>Because you just hear the money - 10 million - but God is concerned about the source.
    <br>Does that money come from stealing?
    <br>Does that money come from corruption?
    <br>Is that money blood money?
    <br>If I take it and it comes from stealing, I will use it for stealing.
    <br>Whatever comes from stealing, goes to stealing.
    <br>Whatever comes from corruption, goes to corruption.
    <br>Whatever comes from blood, goes to blood.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>So, what do I do?
    <br>As a Christian, I am meant to love God above all.
    <br>The meaning of this is - love nothing in comparison of God
    <br>but everything in reference to God.
    <br>So my brother offers me 10 million dollars. Wonderful.
    <br>What do I do? - I go back to God.
    <br>What does God say? What is God's opinion?
    <br>What is His will? What is His will in this matter?
    <br>And there will be guidance and direction, and you won't make a mistake.
    <br>I go to my brother here, Mr Social Relations.
    <br>Just invite me to a party, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I will send him all kinds of friends - friends from everywhere.
    <br>Merci. (Thank you.)
    <br>Wonderful. This is a multilingual example here. Praise God.
    <br>My friend is inviting me; he said there is a party which has a lot of these friends;
    <br>my family will be there.
    <br>As a Christian, what am I supposed to do?
    <br>Nothing in comparison of God; everything in reference to God.
    <br>What does God say?
    <br>This party - is it a place where Jesus will be welcomed?
    <br>The activities there - are they in line with God?
    <br>Are they going to be serving and selling things that contradict my faith?
    <br>If I go there, am I going to be exposed to things that will pollute my spirit?
    <br>Carry God along.
    <br>As a Christian.
    <br>I'm going to Mr Position. Sir, you can just offer me a position.
    <br>I'm offering you the CEO position of a multinational company.
    <br>Wow! CEO!
    <br>Look, don't get carried away.
    <br>Don't begin to say, "Yes, sir" instantly. "I will be there tomorrow, sir."
    <br>What do you do as a Christian?
    <br>You go to God.
    <br>What does God say?
    <br>What is His will? What is His opinion?
    <br>Nothing in comparison of God; everything in reference to Him.
    <br>That is a Christian who loves God above all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But many of us today...
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>Many of us today - you know the problem we have?
    <br>Just stand here.
    <br>The problem we have today is that we see God as one of those thigns.
    <br>Yes, money is important to me; my friends, family are important to me.
    <br>My job, position; God too is important to me.
    <br>No!
    <br>How can you equate God, the Creator with the created?
    <br>How can you begin to put God at the same level with these material possessions?
    <br>But this is what many of us do.
    <br>By the time my brother here offers me that 10 million dollars,
    <br>I will seek some advice.
    <br>I will say, "God, want do you say about the 10 million dollars?"
    <br>It is nothing before me.
    <br>God says, it is nothing before Him.
    <br>He is saying, "Look, don't be too much in a haste and rush to take that money".
    <br>But I say, "Look, before I just listen to God, let me ask Position.
    <br>Maybe Mr Position has something to say.
    <br>What do you want to say about the 10 million dollars?
    <br>It is good money.
    <br>You begin to say, "Oh, this is difficult.
    <br>God is saying, maybe I shouldn't but look, Position is saying, it is good.
    <br>My friends, my family, they are going to agree.
    <br>10 million dollars - they will enjoy from that.
    <br>Money, of course, is offering it to me.
    <br>You begin to have confusion, conflict because you have equated God with the created.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Check yourself".
    <br>Now, this is not even the worst part of it.
    <br>Do you know the worst part of it?
    <br>Many of us today have not only put God as one of those things,
    <br>we have actually picked another God.
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>Some of us have put Mr Money in the position of God.
    <br>You know, Christmas is a time to give, a time to love, a time to share.
    <br>God may speak to your heart and tell you to go and help someone.
    <br>"Go and take care of an orpan."
    <br>Just tell me to go and look after someone, sir.
    <br>Go and look after someone.
    <br>Take care of him.
    <br>Now, God has spoken to your heart.
    <br>There is an orphan; there is a homeless child. Go and look after them.
    <br>But do you know what many of us do?
    <br>"Let me quickly check with money.
    <br>Let me ask Mr Money first."
    <br>What is he going to say?
    <br>I want you to quit Christianity.
    <br>Wow. Money even wants me to quit Christianity. Crazy.
    <br>But in this case, money can never advise you to start helping people without an instant gain.
    <br>Money will want to see you put something and get something out.
    <br>You can't just go and help someone with no one there to give you back.
    <br>The principles of money do not permit that.
    <br>God is the one that will cause you and ask you to sow to the Spirit.
    <br>You will help someone without any return -
    <br>you sow to the Spirit; you reap peace of heart.
    <br>But money will say, "No! How can you waste your money on that?
    <br>There are investment here, there are investments there".
    <br>We have now put money, position, friends in the place of God.
    <br>We do everything in reference to money.
    <br>God may say, "Go here"; you say, "Let me quickly confirm from my family".
    <br>My family says, "Don't do it"; I say, "God, sorry. My family said I cannot go".
    <br>You put your family above God.
    <br>I'm not saying you should not love your family; I'm not saying we don't need money;
    <br>I'm not saying there is no good position.
    <br>I'm talking of what is your priority,
    <br>what is number 1 in your life.
    <br>God gave His best for you at Christmas.
    <br>Have you given your best to Him?
    <br>Let me round up this example. Come, sir.
    <br>Do you know one thing?
    <br>Sooner or later, you will realise this truth.
    <br>Money can fail you.
    <br>What you invested in for years can be gone in seconds.
    <br>Friends, family - they can fail you.
    <br>The person that is smiling at your front today can stab you in the back tomorrow.
    <br>The person you love - they can die, they can leave you tomorrow, they can fail you.
    <br>Position can fail you.
    <br>You have seen people who have been at the top today; tomorrow, they are at the bottom.
    <br>Only Jesus will never fail you!
    <br>Why would you then compare Him to this?
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>What is going on?
    <br>Put your trust in money, man and materials - you are doomed to disappointment.
    <br>Put your trust in Jesus - you will never be confounded in time or eternity.
    <br>He is Alpha and Omega, beginning and end, first and last, the I AM that I AM.
    <br>He is God, Creator.
    <br>And you know one thing about God?
    <br>Let me tell you a truth about God.
    <br>As you are busy trying to please money, trying to please man,
    <br>trying to woo sympathy to gain position, God is just looking at you
    <br>because Prophet T.B. Joshua says, Jesus is a democrat;
    <br>He does not impose Himself on anyone.
    <br>He will not force you to follow Him.
    <br>He will not beg you to believe in Him.
    <br>He will not force you to serve Him.
    <br>He will wait.
    <br>By the time you have exhausted your worldly advantages -
    <br>you tried money, it failed you, you tried man that disappointed you,
    <br>you tried position, you don't have peace.
    <br>By the time you have exhausted your worldly advantages, you will come back to God
    <br>and at that time, you will value Him and put Him where He belongs -
    <br>put Him as number one, the first place.
    <br>And I pray you won't have grey hairs by the time you do that
    <br>because many of us are wasting so much time on Mr Money,
    <br>trying to please Mr Money, woo Mr Money, getting Mr Money's attention.
    <br>I'm not saying money is not good.
    <br>If this man gives me 10 million and I go to God and God sees it is clean and clear,
    <br>it is a blessing from Him, go ahead - "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>I'm talking about what is first in your life.
    <br>Today, if many of us received a call that 10 million dollars are waiting,
    <br>you would quickly tell the usher, "I'm going to the toilet".
    <br>From the toilet, you are gone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, this Christmas, love God above all".
    <br>O COME LET US ADORE HIM
    <br>Alright. Thank you very much to my wonderful actors.
    <br>You can come and take an altar fruit
    <br>so we can move on to a new life.
    <br>Mr Money will now give His life completely to Jesus.
    <br>Mr Position...
    <br>Wow.
    <br>This is altar fruit but because he is God, we cannot query him.
    <br>He should go ahead.
    <br>May God query him.
    <br>Now brethren, this is what Jesus meant in Matthew 6:33 when He said,
    <br>"Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
    <br>and then everything else will be added unto you".
    <br>Today, we want to seek everything else; expect the Kingdom to follow.
    <br>But Jesus said, "Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
    <br>and then everything else will be added unto you".
    <br>Today, so many of us want to see Jesus but we are not prepared to seek Him.
    <br>We want to see Him but we are not ready to seek Him.
    <br>We want to see His miracles but we are not ready to seek His ways.
    <br>We want to see His power; we are not ready to seek His character.
    <br>We want to see Him but we are not prepared to seek Him.
    <br>Wise men still seek Jesus.
    <br>Wise women still seek Jesus.
    <br>Just as it was in the time when Jesus was born and the wise men came.
    <br>In our generation, wise men still seek Jesus.
    <br>If you just come to church today and you are just here for a miracle,
    <br>"God give me a miracle; give me blessing!",
    <br>I want to advise you this Christmas.
    <br>Stop seeking a miracle; start seeking Jesus and the miracle will come.
    <br>You know that God wants the best for you.
    <br>Christmas demonstrates that; He wants the best for you.
    <br>Why can't you trust Him, put Him first
    <br>and He will give you what His best for you in His time, in His way, for His glory?
    <br>Let's round up this message; coming to a conclusion.
    <br>If you want the ministry to be strong, your relationship with God must be strong.
    <br>I'm not just talking about those in the church - pastors or evangelists - for those in the vineyard. No!
    <br>As a Christian, whatever you do through God is your calling - your ministry.
    <br>Your profession as a Christian flows from your relationship with Jesus.
    <br>If you want your career to prosper, your relationship with God must prosper.
    <br>If you want your marriage to be strong, your relationship with God must be strong.
    <br>If you want your business to be great, your relationship with God must be great.
    <br>If you want this Christmas to be a Merry Christmas, your relationship with God must be merry.
    <br>Leaders, people in authority and position, if you want your nation to be great,
    <br>your relationship with God must be great.
    <br>Your great love for God will make you great
    <br>because whatever we do for God is a reflection of our relationship with God.
    <br>It is all about Jesus.
    <br>Stop talking about your limited education and start loving Jesus.
    <br>Stop complaining that everyone in my family is poor; start loving Jesus.
    <br>Stop repeating stories of those who have failed you in the past and start loving Jesus.
    <br>Stop pointing fingers at the economy of your nation, the politics of your nation
    <br>and start loving Jesus.
    <br>Stop meditating on your flaws, weaknesses, failures, frailties and start loving Jesus.
    <br>Your great love for God will make you great.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If the love of Christ is in our hearts, the world is under our feet and the sky is our limit.
    <br>Our love for Christ will produce this virtue and Christ's love for us will produce this effect upon us.
    <br>So brethren, this Christmas, love God above all.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
