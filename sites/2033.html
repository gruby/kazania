  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world - thank you.
    <br>Let's take our reading from the Book of 1 John 4:1:
    <br>"Beloved, do not believe every spirit,
    <br>but test the spirits whether they are of God;
    <br>because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
    <br>By this you know the Spirit of God:
    <br>Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
    <br>and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.
    <br>And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.
    <br>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them,
    <br>because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world."
    <br>This will lead us to the Book of Romans 3:10 and the Book of Isaiah 38:4,
    <br>and also the Book of Luke 7:2.
    <br>We have heard the message.
    <br>Beloved, not every spirit but prove the spirits, whether they are of God,
    <br>because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
    <br>The question: how do we tell who is a true prophet and a false prophet?
    <br>That is the question now.
    <br>We can take our title:
    <br>A TRUE PROPHET
    <br>The one having the divine Spirit that comes from above
    <br>is meek, peaceable, humble and refrains from all impurities of this world.
    <br>The Bible says, "He contents himself with fewer wants than those other men."
    <br>This Spirit speaks only when God wishes it to speak.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This Spirit speaks only when God wishes it to speak."
    <br>People today, think that healing, blessing, breakthrough
    <br>and all of God's blessings are wrought at will by the person concerned.
    <br>This is why, today when you see a prophet, you ask him for prayer
    <br>not minding whether it is the right time or not.
    <br>When you see a prophet - "Pray for me."
    <br>A prophet will not pray without Spirit intimation, suggestion,
    <br>"Pray! T.B. Joshua, pray, in Jesus' name."
    <br>Without Spirit's suggestion T.B. Joshua will not pray.
    <br>That is why there is breakthrough.
    <br>Others are always ready to pray.
    <br>When you say, "Pastor, prophet, pray for me" - "In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus..."
    <br>In each instance, a prophet will not open his mouth to pray without Spirit intimation.
    <br>This is why when you meet a true prophet of God and say "Pray for me", he will just say, "No, you are blessed. Go."
    <br>A true prophet shall prophecy that which he shall live to see accomplished
    <br>because intimation is given by the Spirit.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of John 7:6.
    <br>"Then Jesus said to them, 'My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready' ".
    <br>When He was called to go out and perform a miracle, He said, "No. It is not the time.
    <br>Until I have heard from the Father, I will not do so."
    <br>Take it from verse 4.
    <br>"For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly.
    <br>If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
    <br>For even His brothers did not believe in Him.
    <br>Then Jesus said to them, 'My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready' ".
    <br>That means others are always ready to pray.
    <br>They say, "Pray for me" - they pray.
    <br>No. Not at our will but the will of the Father.
    <br>Let me give you a short story: A tribute to my late mother.
    <br>She advised me to look into my love walk.
    <br>When I do not seem to receive from God, I should look into my love walk.
    <br>If I say, "God, give me this biscuit" and after the prayer for many days - no.
    <br>She said to me, "Look into your love walk."
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself - look into that, work on that.
    <br>When I was in primary school, each time I came back from school,
    <br>I would learn that my mummy was in the mountain praying.
    <br>I would not bother to go home but would go straight to the mountain.
    <br>My mummy would be there praying.
    <br>I too became a prayer warrior from a little age.
    <br>Sometimes, she would give me an assignment.
    <br>She would say, "I used to have a nightmare in so and so area" and that I should fast.
    <br>By the time I prayed and fasted, she would call me and say that my prayer had been answered.
    <br>That made me to know then that prayer has power.
    <br>She would tell me, "The prayer you offered for me - I stopped having that nightmare."
    <br>That gladdened my heart that this is the way to talk to God!
    <br>This is the road to talk to God; this is the roadmap.
    <br>Yes, that is my mum.
