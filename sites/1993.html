    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>My name is Nasrin.
    <br>I am from Australia.
    <br>My nationality is Iranian.
    <br>I can't move.
    <br>I have a neck, back and shoulder problem, and too much anxiety and stress.
    <br>I can't move.
    <br>An emergency ambulance came and took me to hospital.
    <br>Later, I was given an injection and tablets.
    <br>They discharged me after a few hours.
    <br>A bone in my spine came out.
    <br>We can see some medical devices; the neck collar and the lumbar corset.
    <br>They are holding my neck and back because I am in pain.
    <br>It is not a permanent solution.
    <br>My sickness became worse.
    <br>These documents are all for my back and neck: MRI, ultrasound scan, medication
    <br>and a medical report from the doctor.
    <br>I have a carer.
    <br>She is helping me in doing everything - helping my daughter and assisting me.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you have just listened to the woman.
    <br>She has been bedridden.
    <br>You can see she has been laying down permanently on the bed because she cannot move.
    <br>She is from Iran but she is living in Australia.
    <br>This is the condition in which satan has held her in bondage.
    <br>But by the mercy of God, she is going to be free today.
    <br>Remember that distance is not a barrier because God is Spirit.
    <br>He can be in all places at all times by His Spirit.
    <br>Madam, we want you to know one thing;
    <br>your miracle, healing is just a moment away.
    <br>One thing we want you to know; certainly it is not all up to God and certainly not all up to us.
    <br>It takes God's power and your genuine willingness to receive this freedom.
    <br>But my question is: How genuine are you?
    <br>Are you ready to receive the new life in Christ Jesus?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because Jesus Christ's objectivity was based and founded on commitment
    <br>and genuineness of faith.
    <br>Right now, open your heart and release your heart from every offence, pain, grudge.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>be forgiven, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be forgiven, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Right now, I command you to be released from every captivity of affliction.
    <br>Be released from every captivity of satan.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ - be released from every affliction, sickness.
    <br>We command the healing power of God to move in your body, organs.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>We command the healing power of God to flow through your system, organs.
    <br>Every joint, back pain - be free!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>By the mercy of God, we command healing in your system.
    <br>Be free,
    <br>in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Now, get up from this bed.
    <br>Distance Is Not A Barrier
    <br>Interactive Prayer Sessions
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, be free!
    <br>Be released from every affliction.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for this undeserved grace.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for your mercy.
    <br>In Jesus' name, you are free.
    <br>Madam, rise up and walk.
    <br>Distance Is Not A Barrier
    <br>Interactive Prayer Sessions
    <br>As you turn round, remove the neck collar, remove the lumbar corset and move freely right now.
    <br>Turn your neck.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Walk; Jesus Christ has set you free to the glory of God.
    <br>Just stand there and turn your back.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for this freedom.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for the grace.
    <br>Now, turn around, move your body.
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Healed Of Inability To Walk & Stiff Neck
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset & Neck Collar
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Now I am walking!
    <br>The pain has gone.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I can walk!
    <br>Healed Of Inability To Walk & Stiff Neck
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset & Neck Collar
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Amen! Remember madam, you are free to follow Jesus Christ.
    <br>In order to maintain this healing you must follow Christ Jesus.
    <br>OK?
    <br>And it shall be permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world:
    <br>By the same anointing that this woman received her healing,
    <br>by the mercy of God - be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>By the mercy of God, you are released from every pain, affliction, sickness!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>You are free!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>It is hard to believe that this is the same woman who was lying on a bed
    <br>dependant on the assistance of carers.
    <br>After her healing, Nasrin is able to do her daily exercises with ease.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am Nasrin, I am from Sydney, Australia.
    <br>I had back and shoulder pain.
    <br>I was always going to hospital and receiving injections and medication.
    <br>I was looking for a permanent solution.
    <br>My friend introduced me to Emmanuel TV and I was prayed for.
    <br>I am now feeling well.
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>Thank you, T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Team!
    <br>I am doing exercise and I am not feeling anymore pain!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Free indeed.
    <br>Nasrin cannot wait to get fit using these exercise machines.
