    <br>CRUSADE WITH T.B. JOSHUA, Cali, Colombia
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Miss Leidy Dominguez - Cali, Colombia
    <br>Her name is Leidy Dominguez, and she comes from Cali, Colombia.
    <br>First of all, I was suffering from an eating disorder and was self-harming.
    <br>I was aggressive and got angry all the time amongst other problems.
    <br>This was what I went through every day.
    <br>She said, in her daily life, she was always angry.
    <br>She had an eating disorder.
    <br>I mainly came because of my sister
    <br>but when I felt the presence of the man of God close to me,
    <br>I started to get desperate and when he touched me, I started running.
    <br>I began to scream out of desperation and wanted to start hurting myself.
    <br>First of all, I came here because of my sister
    <br>but when the prophet came towards her,
    <br>she started to feel anxiety; she started to run, scream and hit herself.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you, how do you now feel?
    <br>I felt so calm and peaceful.
    <br>I came with so many burdens of stress and anger but now everything has gone.
    <br>Now, I have peace.
    <br>She said, she feels at peace and calm.
    <br>She feels that any problem she had with anger is in the past right now.
    <br>How did you hear about today's miracle crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>I heard about the crusade on social networks.
    <br>I first learnt about it through my aunt who attends a church here in Cali.
    <br>She informed us and we confirmed from the social networks that it was true.
    <br>As soon as I knew about it, I went to register my sister for the crusade.
    <br>She said, one of her aunts came to invite her.
    <br>Because of that, she started to look for more information on the internet, social media.
    <br>Because of that, she wanted to bring her sister to this miracle crusade.
    <br>What is your advice to all the youth out there
    <br>that are suffering with the same problems that you had in the past
    <br>such as eating disorders and anger problems?
    <br>Testimony From Colombia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You simply have to look for God because God is love and peace.
    <br>Things like anger, rage, burdens and eating disorders don't come from God.
    <br>They came from demons - the enemy who always wants to destroy us.
    <br>Her advice is that people have to look for God
    <br>because God is love and peace.
    <br>Any problems like anger and eating disorders come from the devil.
    <br>Don't be stubborn; if you are delivered, it is because God is working in your life and He is calling you.
    <br>I am speaking from my experience; I have been stubborn many times.
    <br>That was why the devil could always find an opportunity to enter my life.
    <br>She said, we have to be close to God.
    <br>We thank God for your deliverance today.
    <br>It is not enough to just seek deliverance but it is also important to maintain your deliverance
    <br>by staying close to Jesus.
    <br>Testimony From Colombia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you very much. I just love God; He is great!
    <br>Thank you very much. God is great!
    <br>Jesus is great!
    <br>He alone is my Father!
