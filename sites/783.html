    <br>WARNING! The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Mr. Hennie Ferreira has come to The SCOAN, seeking the face of God for divine healing
    <br>from the terrible problem of leg cancer.
    <br>Imagine the excruciating pain and social embarrassment
    <br>this leg cancer would cause him on a daily basis.
    <br>The flesh is rotting and completely exposed.
    <br>A closer look reveals two large open wounds on his legs,
    <br>where the infected skin has been eaten away.
    <br>But he has come, believing that his problem does not embarrass Jesus Christ
    <br>because He has a solution.
    <br>My name is Hennie Ferreira. I am 42 years old.
    <br>What is the problem that brought you here to The SCOAN?
    <br>Leg cancer.
    <br>How long have you had this problem?
    <br>I have had this problem for approximately one year now.
    <br>I have got a lot of pains and I have had a lot of operations
    <br>but the treatment from the doctors hasn't relieved me of the pain.
    <br>I believe that God Almighty will heal me when the Prophet prays for me.
    <br>Now seated at the prayer line of The SCOAN,
    <br>Mr Hennie Ferreira waits in faith for a healing touch from Jesus Christ
    <br>through the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, be healed!
    <br>A spiritual operation is taking place,
    <br>as the healing power of Jesus Christ is released into his system.
    <br>The sickness in the life of Mr Ferreira is going out
    <br>because it has been commanded to go in Jesus' name.
    <br>Jesus Christ purchased our complete healing at the price of great suffering.
    <br>For by His wounds, we are healed.
    <br>Jesus, the great Restorer, is restoring Mr Ferreira
    <br>to the original position in which he was created in perfect health.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Hallelujah! He has been declared free in Jesus' name.
    <br>After his healing, Mr. Ferreira returned to his country of South Africa.
    <br>Now, he has come back after one year
    <br>to testify to his perfect and complete healing in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Yeah!
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>I am saved!
    <br>The smile on Mr. Ferreira's face is one of joy and gratitude to God.
    <br>"Thank you" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>He happily shows the skin on his legs, where the terrible cancer once was.
    <br>Now, the skin is smooth and the wound has completely healed.
    <br>A steadfast look at the crucified One never looks in vain at the great physician.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the great physician.
    <br>When He heals, He heals effectually, He heals completely.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let's listen to his testimony.
    <br>I'm redeemed!
    <br>I'm born again!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Hennie Ferreira.
    <br>I'm here to testify about the healing that I received at The SCOAN.
    <br>A year ago, I was here for healing of leg cancer.
    <br>The night the Prophet prayed for me, I knew I was completely healed.
    <br>Today I am here to testify.
    <br>Actually, there was nothing the doctors could do for me or the pain.
    <br>Since that night, I have not used any injection.
    <br>My pain is gone.
    <br>I'm so glad that God healed me of leg cancer.
    <br>Here, you can all see what happened.
    <br>The other side - there is also no pain.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My promise to God is that I will sin no more and I will always serve God.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>This is the leg. You can see I have no more pain.
    <br>My leg is completely healed.
    <br>Thank God for that.
    <br>The second one also.
    <br>Mr. Ferreira demonstrates how he can now touch the place
    <br>where the cancer once was on his legs.
    <br>His pain is a thing of the past.
    <br>His testimony has truly been restored.
    <br>Glory be to God!
