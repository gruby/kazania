  <p>    
    <br>At The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua leads the congregation in mass prayer
    <br>and the power of God immediately comes on the scene
    <br>and uproots whatever that is not of God in their lives.
    <br>He begins to prophesy and exposes the hand of the devil in the lives of the people.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>There is a brother - you have tattoo everywhere; I think I touched you.
    <br>With your tattoo, here.
    <br>You're a criminal - wearing dark, dark.
    <br>That spirit is tormenting you, disturbing you.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>My name is Tebogo. 
    <br>I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I am 37 years old.
    <br>I am the firstborn from the three boys that have been given birth to
    <br>by this wonderful woman here right beside me.
    <br>This is my mum.
    <br>Tebogo & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Yes, I'm thankful to be here, all glory be to God.
    <br>Last weekend, Prophet TB Joshua actually prophesied and called me out from amongst the crowd.
    <br>I was actually sitting right at the back
    <br>and I didn't want to sit in the front.
    <br>But he actually called me and he
    <br> told me that, this is something
    <br>I never told nobody and I think
    <br> nobody knew about that.
    <br>But he just called me and told me
    <br> that I used to live a life of a crime,
    <br>and that this spirit is actually tormenting me
    <br>and it's going to disturb me and give me trouble.
    <br>That's when I came out. 
    <br>Yes, indeed it is true.
    <br>Though some of the things that I'm going to say,
    <br>this is the first time that I will be telling the truth.
    <br>Even my mum I never told her the truth.
    <br>This is the first time that she'll
    <br> be hearing me saying this,
    <br>live on camera.
    <br>It actually started around 1996.
    <br>I was in my high school year.
    <br>Raised as a boy with good values,
    <br>being in high school, getting straight A's from school...
    <br>By then I was a good boy in the house, doing all chores,
    <br>being good in the house.
    <br>But every time I went to the street, everything changed though -
    <br>I had to be like a crook in the neighborhood
    <br>due to growing up under the older guys.
    <br>We used to stay next to a park.
    <br>So they used to sell drugs and have cars.
    <br>They taught us how to wash cars,
    <br>and how to open a car without a key and things like that.
    <br>So we sold weed and drugs for them in that park.
    <br>So that's how I got introduced to street life.
    <br>At what age were you when you actually began
    <br>the issue of selling drugs and meeting with these older gang members?
    <br>At what age were you?
    <br>I was still young, it was my early years of studying in high school.
    <br>I think I was 16 - 17 years old.
    <br>We actually started just looking at them,
    <br>doing what they do, like having guns out there,
    <br>washing cars and doing all these things.
    <br>So they taught us how to -
    <br>like I said - open a door of a car without having the keys,
    <br>and knowing with which cables you can
    <br>start a car without using a key.
    <br>We used to sell drugs by the parks where we used to be playing games.
    <br>By the park we used to do recreational things.
    <br>We used to play, tumbling and all that,
    <br>but then we would be around the park and selling drugs for them.
    <br>My mum wouldn't know what I was doing -
    <br>I would go back and I would be a good boy in the house
    <br>but every time I went outside on the street,
    <br>those are the things I had to do -
    <br>doing the material and vanity...
    <br>As a youth, those are the things that 
    <br>were actually exciting being a group.
    <br>So I was a junior member of a gang,
    <br> as you would like to say.
    <br>That's when we started being in the park, we started robbing people with knives.
    <br>But at first I was young, we would 
    <br>drop like vulnerable people,
    <br>like people who are drunk or people who are a couple which is chilling at the park.
    <br>We just robbed them their belongings like that.
    <br>And then it went to like graduating, having a gun.
    <br>The first encounter with a gun - it was my friends and I -
    <br>I think it  was in 1997 or towards 1997 or so,
    <br>I was still in high school with the best friend of mine
    <br>and we actually disarmed the gun from a friend of mine -
    <br>the other friend of mine who came with 
    <br>his father's gun and he showed us the gun.
    <br>But we took the gun from him.
    <br>We had a fight - my friend and I again -
    <br>because we actually didn't know who was supposed to keep the gun.
    <br>I wanted to keep it - he wanted to keep it too.
    <br>So we kept the gun between us - sometimes it would be in my house,
    <br>sometimes it would be in his house.
    <br>And that's how we ended up selling drugs,
    <br>after selling drugs, we started disarming other people
    <br>who were selling drugs in our community
    <br>because we wanted actually to own the territory.
    <br>So if we knew that you were selling drugs in our community,
    <br>then we would come through to you and rob you
    <br>with a gun - from knives to guns.
    <br>And then, having money for drugs and things like that,
    <br>we actually moved on to disarming other guys who had guns.
    <br>And that brought us some more of other gangs.
    <br>By then I was still young,
    <br>I was still being used because I didn't have fear.
    <br>I wouldn't have fear, I didn't hesitate
    <br> in doing things;
    <br>even if I was scared, I didn't hesitate in doing things.
    <br>So I would disarm and have a gun
    <br>but my mum didn't know anything, she thought I was just a good boy.
    <br>She can tell you, I was just a good boy.
    <br>Everything was just sweet and 
    <br>stuff like that.
    <br>Sometimes I would be in prison - in and out.
    <br>I wouldn't even tell her.
    <br>l would stay in prison for two or three days,
    <br>but I didn't tell her.
    <br>A couple of times - in and out, and selling drugs.
    <br>She would hear that I was selling drugs
    <br>but she heard that at the later stage.
    <br>That was when I was actually at the university
    <br>because I graduated from the university as well.
    <br>After graduating from the university,
    <br>that's when I was older and I started having a car.
    <br>Even when I brought a car to her, I told her, "Mama, I bought a car" -
    <br>she didn't know that the car was stolen.
    <br>But I told her that I bought a car, and she knew that I bought a car.
    <br>I would come to her, she would help 
    <br>me with money and things like that.
    <br>I would go back and spend it the way I spent it.
    <br>Okay, so you said from the robbery using both knives and guns,
    <br>you now graduated also to stealing cars.
    <br>Can you explain how you would go about that?
    <br>Well, stealing cars - we would do it like with the guns and knives -
    <br>we would go for vulnerable people, we would go to places where people didn't know us.
    <br>For instance, we would go for a neighbourhood where they didn't even know us.
    <br>We would just go there in the morning and we would go and rob -
    <br>maybe a drunk guy in a pub who was about to go to his car.
    <br>So as he was going to his car, we would just pop up, take him,
    <br>put him in the boot and tie him up.
    <br>We would take a car, just park it somewhere in a mall for the whole day
    <br>and just leave it there; we would be standing a way off,
    <br>just looking at the car for the cops to come through.
    <br>After one day or two days without cops, then we would know that it was not bad.
    <br>By then there were no such things as trackers and things like that.
    <br>So it was easy for us to get cars.
    <br>Our brother is giving this confession to confirm that word of prophecy
    <br>he received last week that he was involved in a life of crime.
    <br>And he's saying that what he is confessing right now,
    <br>his mother is actually hearing it for the first time.
    <br>Because when you went back to your house, you would pretend,
    <br>you would be a good boy in the house, involving yourself in various chores.
    <br>But your mum would not know that outside,
    <br>you were living this very criminal lifestyle, is that right?
    <br>Yes, sir. My mum didn't know about the 
    <br>criminal lifestyle that I was living.
    <br>I think it was after when things got really bad for me
    <br>because at some time, I was in and out of prison
    <br>but there was a point when I was in prison
    <br>and I thought I had some previous things that I had done and I have been imprisoned.
    <br>So being in prison this time, they would actually bring back my file
    <br>and see that I had previous things that I had done in my life,
    <br>so I had to go for a longer period at that time.
    <br>That's when I went to prison and being in prison,
    <br>I had to learn the ways of surviving.
    <br>I started having tattoos - I got my first tattoos when I was in prison,
    <br>having RAF3 tattoos, having it right at the bottom of my legs.
    <br>And then I had to know how to survive there inside,
    <br>being a cleaner, having food and things like roll-on, lotions, weed, cigarettes.
    <br>So I had access to these things since I was in the passage, being a cleaner.
    <br>That's when I was introduced into doing tattoos.
    <br>But then, that love of tattoos came from 
    <br>the time when I studied fine arts at school.
    <br>I used to do fine arts, conceptual study, history of art and things like that.
    <br>We just want you to explain that aspect in prison very clearly.
    <br>You said, when you were in prison, you found a way of getting things of surviving in prison.
    <br>Can you tell us, was there a form of initiation
    <br>into a certain gang whilst you were there in prison
    <br>or how did you find your way in prison to have such things?
    <br>Yes, there are rules in prison.
    <br>There was a paper that they pasted at the back of the door when you went in.
    <br>It's like they don't force you to join the gang;
    <br>they don't force you to be a member of a gang.
    <br>But there are rules that if you have any complaints,
    <br>if they come in the morning and come to you,
    <br>if you have any complains, you can tell the warden
    <br>that this guy is troubling me or this guy did this.
    <br>But then I had ways to get things: I had sheets, I had roll-on and I had colgate.
    <br>These are the essentials - very important things that you need in jail.
    <br>So if new guys came in, they would clean for us
    <br>and if they needed something, they would exchange for that.
    <br>That's when I really saw that I needed my mum,
    <br>and that's when I called her.
    <br>And she came through, she always came through.
    <br>We cried together.
    <br>I didn't like the life I was living because like I said, I have two brothers that I left at home.
    <br>Okay, so our brother is explaining that because of this lifestyle,
    <br>he was going in and out of prison.
    <br>He was actually in prison for a long time as a result of the activities he was involved in.
    <br>Brother, can you just explain to us, even after coming out of prison,
    <br>would you find yourself still going back 
    <br>to those same criminal activities
    <br>to get money even after having been in prison and served a prison sentence?
    <br>Yes, it was not easy because you know,
    <br>as a youth, you often fight for a sense of belonging.
    <br>So I tried so many things even in prison.
    <br>I tried joining the Islam or study Hare Krishna.
    <br>At some point I was a Rasta, I smoked weed
    <br>and sold drugs - a whole lot of drugs.
    <br>There was a way that I would often go back and bounce back to that.
    <br>Because even when I came back out of prison,
    <br>people came to my house and told me that they needed drugs.
    <br>So having a lot of people coming to my house that needed drugs,
    <br>I saw an opportunity that maybe I should go back and have these things.
    <br>And then I had drugs and at some point, I was working through the carnivals and
    <br>I would travel to a whole lot of places.
    <br>I got hold of professional machines for doing tattoos.
    <br>Since I learned that in prison of doing tattoos
    <br>and knowing that I was good in drawing and doing these things,
    <br>I bought these tattoo kits and I was a tattoo artist at some point.
    <br>Okay, was there ever a time after coming out of prison
    <br>that you involved yourself in an operation whereby you were actually almost caught
    <br>or you sustained an injury in the process of a robbery operation that you were undertaking?
    <br>Yes, I would call that the biggest turn of my life
    <br>because there were certain things that happened in my life - what is being called 'karma'.
    <br>Like when you do bad things and bad things will follow you.
    <br>So there were certain things that I did that happened to me
    <br>and when they happened, it was not a surprise to me.
    <br>I used to rob people and I was once robbed.
    <br>I used to have guns and I was once shot.
    <br>My ankle is actually fused.
    <br>This is the first time that my mum will be hearing this
    <br>because even when I told her about it, I told her a different story.
    <br>But this is the first time that she hears this.
    <br>I was actually involved in a robbery with a few guys.
    <br>We went and robbed a guy for his van,
    <br>a couple of cell phones and a couple of laptops in a basement.
    <br>It was around Johannesburg in Oriental Plaza.
    <br>We robbed the guy - it was 2008.
    <br>I think it was on the 23rd of March.
    <br>We were three guys, I had a gun with me by then.
    <br>The other guys had guns but they needed more guns to go and do the job
    <br>so they called me and we went there.
    <br>Right when we went there, we took the car and we took everything.
    <br>We took the money, I took the money on me.
    <br>I had everything on me, and the other guy just shot.
    <br>He shot the other guy on the leg -
    <br>the guy who was there, whom we robbed.
    <br>And then there was the sound of a gun,
    <br>there were security guards around the area.
    <br>There were cops and there was a chase.
    <br>They chased us, we actually left the car on the road
    <br>and we ran - everybody went his own way.
    <br>And then they chased me, a security guard was chasing me.
    <br>The other friends of mine - I don't know if they were ever get caught or what.
    <br>The other guy who was chasing me with a motorbike - I was having a gun,
    <br>I pointed the gun at him and he moved away from me.
    <br>Then right there, when I was running, I took a ride and I saw a flat.
    <br>It was next to the Oriental Mall Plaza flat; I went into that mall.
    <br>Not into the mall, I went into a flat.
    <br>I went in and I just closed the door to the flat.
    <br>Right there when I closed the door by the flat,
    <br>there was a door and at the bottom of the door, there was a glass there.
    <br>So I just closed it and I sat there - I closed the door with my leg.
    <br>And then I sat there and they thought  that
    <br>probably I had just passed
    <br>because I saw them, a few of them were passing by.
    <br>But right then, there was a guy who just came in.
    <br>I think the guy who stayed in the same flat that I was in
    <br>because I found the door open.
    <br>I was the one who closed the door.
    <br>So the guy who was staying there wanted to push the door
    <br>for him to enter into the flat and I was there.
    <br>He saw that there were cops around and then he leaned a bit and saw me.
    <br>Right when he saw me, that's when he told the cops, "Okay, the guy is there".
    <br>I heard him say, "The guy is there".
    <br>I tried to run but I heard a shot.
    <br>That's when they shot me on the ankle
    <br>and then I ran, I dragged myself.
    <br>Just next to the building, there was a mosque; it was around 5 o'clock.
    <br>I think it was the time when they were about to start their service.
    <br>So I went in there, I dragged myself,
    <br>I took my gun, I put it in a jacket, I wrapped it with a jacket.
    <br>I wrapped my leg, but when I looked at my leg, it was wobbling.
    <br>It was my first encounter of being shot so I felt like my feet was going to...
    <br>I felt that this was a terrible pain.
    <br>It was really drastic.
    <br>So I dragged myself and sat behind the door at the mosque.
    <br>So they were passing through; inside the mosque, there was a guy who was singing at the top.
    <br>So I kept on asking for water from these guys and I drank a lot of water.
    <br>At this point, your foot was heavily bleeding from the gunshots?
    <br>Yes, I was heavily bleeding, that was the reason
    <br>I took a jacket and wrapped my leg with a jacket for them not to see it.
    <br>So they probably thought I was a beggar.
    <br>They gave me some water, some of them just passed me there.
    <br>But then it was the time for the service to end, then they went out.
    <br>I went out and I dragged myself.
    <br>By then it was around quarter past six.
    <br>I'm not sure but it was past six in the afternoon.
    <br>I dragged myself and sat just outside the building -
    <br>There was a place  where I could hide myself; I just hid myself there.
    <br>Next to that mosque was another building where there was a motorbike fix store.
    <br>There were other guys who were fixing motorcycles.
    <br>I think these guys were coming for a night shift.
    <br>So they came in there, and when
    <br> they went in, they saw me there.
    <br>And they asked me, "What's happening?"
    <br>and I told them - I lied to them again -
    <br>"I was robbed and I got shot. Please, I need help.
    <br>Can you call an ambulance for me?"
    <br>But the other guy told me, "No, aren't you the guy who was there around?"
    <br>because he saw that there were cops around.
    <br>So by then I couldn't lie, so I told him, "Yes, I am the guy",
    <br>and I pulled out cash from my pockets.
    <br>I think I pulled out three thousand or something like that.
    <br>I gave them all the money I had and said,
    <br>"I am the guy, please, can you help me and call me an ambulance?"
    <br>I stayed there till the ambulance came around midnight.
    <br>Then the ambulance took me, I went to Helen Joseph Hospital.
    <br>Right there in Helen Joseph Hospital they came with scissors,
    <br>they tried to cut my clothing and all that
    <br>because I was heavily bleeding but I got a chance - I took the gun again,
    <br>I hid it with my jacket, I put it right there
    <br>where my clothing and my belonging could be -
    <br>in like a small cabinet just next to my bed.
    <br>I went to the theatre and came back.
    <br>When I came back, I found that the gun was still there, and I stayed there.
    <br>I called my girlfriend. I have two kids with my wife, I was staying with her then.
    <br>I called her to come and get the gun.
    <br>She came and got the gun from the place.
    <br>Okay, so we're listening to this life experience of our brother.
    <br>He said that during one of these robbery operations,
    <br>he was actually shot in the ankle and taken to the hospital.
    <br>He actually lied there that he had been attacked
    <br>whereas he was actually the one involved in the robbery operation.
    <br>Brother, for how long were you in the hospital as a result of this gunshot to your ankle?
    <br>I stayed in the hospital for about nine months
    <br>because I had to go through operations.
    <br>I think I had to go for three operations.
    <br>But my mom used to come and visit me there,
    <br>and she was a believer, she would pray for me.
    <br>There were evangelists and people who would pray for me around there.
    <br>But I wouldn't want to listen to them because I was fed up.
    <br>But I didn't know I was angry at God, I asked God,
    <br>"Why did You do this to me? I'm a good boy.
    <br>I'm a first graduate and all this. Why are You doing this to me?"
    <br>So I was just fed up, I didn't want to hear prayers.
    <br>But when she came - she is my mum -
    <br>when she came, I would listen to her and she would pray for me.
    <br>Okay, so as our brother said earlier, our mother is actually hearing
    <br>the truth behind this incident for the first time.
    <br>She was under the impression that her son was attacked in a robbery operation,
    <br>hence the gun wound on his leg, whereas today, he is confessing for the first time
    <br>that he was actually the one who perpetrated that robbery operation.
    <br>So brother, even after you came out from the hospital with this injury to your ankle,
    <br>did this mean you still continued this life of selling drugs and these criminal activities?
    <br>It was a turning point because I felt like there was nothing I could do.
    <br>I used to skate, I used to play basketball,
    <br>I'm an artist so I needed to climb stairs and things like that
    <br>so my leg was very important to me.
    <br>I asked myself like, "What next?"
    <br>I thought that maybe I would die; if I did something else, I would die.
    <br>But I bounced back, I went back to the neighbourhood,
    <br>I went back to selling drugs again.
    <br>By then I sold drugs and I continued doing tattoos again.
    <br>But I still had a gun with me.
    <br>Okay, so now you said that you actually became a tattoo artist,
    <br>that you learned about tattoes whilst you were in prison.
    <br>Could you just explain to us more about the tattoes that you put all over your body?
    <br>I would do tattoos - I don't know, if maybe I could show you?
    <br>Tebogo & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Our brother is explaining that he actually put tattoes across his entire body.
    <br>As he said, he was a tattoo artist.
    <br>And this is exactly as the man of God prophesied in the word of prophecy -
    <br>he said, there is a brother there that has tattoes all over his body
    <br>and this is what we are seeing now.
    <br>So just tell us, brother, what prompted you to be doing such?
    <br>Like I said, I was angry at God.
    <br>There were a whole lot of things that happened to me and I was angry at God.
    <br>Hence, I did the Lord's prayer on my cheek.
    <br>I did some wings on my neck.
    <br>I did a whole lot of tattoes all over my body.
    <br>When I came back, I continued selling drugs.
    <br>And then something happened to me again.
    <br>At a certain point, I was with my girlfriend, she bought a car
    <br>and I was chilling just next to my house at the front of my gate
    <br>and I was hijacked.
    <br>They actually tried to hijack us - me and my girlfriend.
    <br>There were four guys who wanted to hijack and I was knived six times.
    <br>I stayed in prison, I was knifed right here in the middle of my throat.
    <br>I was knifed right here on my nerve.
    <br>I was knifed right here in the middle.
    <br>I think, at the back... she knows - she came again and prayed for me right there.
    <br>So what you were doing to others now actually happened to you
    <br>and they attempted to hijack your car,
    <br>and you were stabbed six times with a knife when you were with your girlfriend.
    <br>So what you were doing to others now came back and happened to you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Can you just tell us, today to the glory of God, we can actually see you
    <br>standing in the presence of God with your mum here in The SCOAN.
    <br>Could you just tell us, how did it happen that you came to be here in The SCOAN today?
    <br>Well, I used to be in denial. Actually she's a believer.
    <br>She always used to pray whenever I came.
    <br>I don't know how she knew that but every time I came and was about to leave the house,
    <br>she used to pray for me and gave me some of TB Joshua's books to read at home.
    <br>Every time I came back, she asked me, "Did you read those books?"
    <br>But I started to read those books.
    <br>Right then, I met someone - while she was praying for me -
    <br>I met someone in the hospital before I got discharged,
    <br>who actually told me that I should tell my story to someone in order for me to get healed.
    <br>So that's how I got healed.
    <br>Okay, can you explain, when your mum initially introduced you to The SCOAN, Emmanuel TV,
    <br>what was your reaction initially when she introduced you to these things?
    <br>I didn't believe it at all.
    <br>I would watch it,  I mean I would watch Emmanuel TV the whole day.
    <br>And she knows, I would complain to her.
    <br>When she went out, I would change the channel and watch some other things.
    <br>When she came back, we would watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>But I would ask her, "Are we going to watch this thing the whole day?"
    <br>Those were the things I would say to her.
    <br>But now I do, we sit together and we watch it on video.
    <br>So initially you were....
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So initially you were very sceptical but your mum kept persisting and encouraging you.
    <br>And what finally - maybe there was something you saw on Emmanuel TV
    <br>or an experience you had that finally convinced you that you too should come here.
    <br>Well, she's the one who actually shone the light on me.
    <br>She told me, "I know you, I gave birth to you.
    <br>I know you are a good boy, and I miss that good boy in you".
    <br>That thing would make me very sad
    <br>because I wanted to see her smile, I wanted to make her proud.
    <br>I looked at myself, and I was full of tattoes.
    <br>I would ask myself...
    <br>She used to come here and come back.
    <br>She told me, "I've been to The SCOAN.
    <br>It's beautiful. There is power there. You should go there".
    <br>But I would ask her, "How would they accept a guy like me - I am full of tattoes?"
    <br>I meant, how could I enter in the Lord's house?
    <br>I was full of hesitation and in denial of that.
    <br>So you thought that you would not be accepted in the church
    <br>because of your appearance with the tattoes all over your body?
    <br>Indeed, but then it happened differently.
    <br>Even though I was in denial, at some point I was tired of the street.
    <br>I wanted to make her happy - she was 
    <br>always crying.
    <br>When I met her, she was not having a smile and I missed that from her.
    <br>She was my best friend of all, you should see us in the house.
    <br>She is the best. So I missed that.
    <br>One day I told her that...
    <br>She told me that we should go and I told her I want to go.
    <br>She thought I was lying, and I told her, "Yes, I am going to go".
    <br>She gave me money to go and do my passport.
    <br>I ate the money, and she called me again, and I didn't answer her calls.
    <br>But after some time I answered her calls again,
    <br>I agreed to come here and then we came here.
    <br>Right at the airport - I was having tattoes all over my body and I was wearing a T-shirt.
    <br>Our mother who was our coordinater actually gave us a T-shirt
    <br>'My heart is heaven' with a big red heart,
    <br>and I was having tattoes all over my body so I felt that this was a contradiction.
    <br>I would look at people around me, how they were looking at me at the airport,
    <br>in the plane and things like that.
    <br>But when you finally arrived, just tell us what you experienced
    <br>when you came down to the church?
    <br>What I experienced here is something I have never experienced in my life
    <br>because when I came here,
    <br>the guy who came to collect us from the airport - just right when I came in, 
    <br>he just gave me a handshake and said, "Yes, sir, how are you?"
    <br>And that was the first thing - I have never been called 'sir'.
    <br>He just said, "Yes, sir, how are you, sir?" 
    <br>I was like, "I'm good".
    <br>But I was still bitter.
    <br>He said, "Good Morning" - I didn't answer him because I didn't know what it meant.
    <br>So we came together with him but the guy didn't even ask me about my tattoes,
    <br>he didn't even look at me funnily and I still meet him even now.
    <br>So you saw that initial love and acceptance.
    <br>And then when you came down to the church - just tell us, what happened
    <br>as you arrived here at the church and when you came to the Sunday service?
    <br>When I arrived in church, they showed us the place where we should go to sleep.
    <br>But I would stay there where we just sleep.
    <br>I wouldn't come here to church, I would just stay there.
    <br>But there were people who were still looking at me in a different way.
    <br>But when I came here - we would sit in the dining room, we would discuss,
    <br>we would look at people and hear testimonies on Emmanuel TV -
    <br>that I thought I was the worst but when I looked at other testimonies,
    <br>that's when I felt like...
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>That's how the testimonies of others really inspired our brother.
    <br>Brother, on Sunday we witnessed the clip as you sat down in the church
    <br>and the man of God gave that prophecy - can you describe what happened
    <br>on that day when you received the prophecy and ever since then the changes in your life.
    <br>Well, I was still in denial because even when he called me,
    <br>the other evangelist sister...
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua came and touched me.
    <br>But you know, due to I was still in denial, nothing happened.
    <br>I just stood there, he touched me but I was still in denial because I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>I was confused about what was happening around.
    <br>But then when these things happened, when he called me out,
    <br>nobody knew about my life, and when he said that,
    <br>I just came out because I really felt it.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>And to the glory of God, brother - it has been one week now,
    <br>ever since that encounter, what are the changes you have experienced in your life?
    <br>I have experienced love, tolerance.
    <br>As a youth, you have to live like a life of a movie,
    <br>and when you are watching a movie, at the end of the movie it is not nice.
    <br>So I was living like that, but when I came here,
    <br>I would go to Bible classes, meet people around, everybody greets everybody.
    <br>You go to sleep, nobody steals but nobody is told not to steal.
    <br>Things like that; those are the things that matter to me most.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So you're now living a completely new life.
    <br>That spirit that was disturbing you to rob, to steal, to take drugs, sell drugs has completely gone.
    <br>Yes, I can really confess now and say that Jesus Christ is my Saviour.
    <br>Tebogo & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I used to think that I could be saved by certain things, but it's all vanity.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Brother, we know that your past is over and you're completely out of your past life.
    <br>For the glory of God, you mentioned earlier that you actually have tattoos all over your body.
    <br>Could you just actually show us clearly the extent of those tattoes all over your body,
    <br>so that people can really see what the Lord has done for you?
    <br>Tebogo & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So once again, we are just showing this so that people of God can understand
    <br>what Jesus Christ has really delivered our brother from, that life he was living.
    <br>He said earlier that as someone with tattoes all over his body,
    <br>he felt that he would not actually be accepted in the church environment.
    <br>He felt he would be looked down upon or condemned because of his appearance.
    <br>But to the glory of God, when he arrived at The SCOAN,
    <br>what he experienced was love, acceptance and care
    <br>and that really touched him, for him to have seen such a reception in the house of God
    <br>and as a result, when the word of prophecy came forth,
    <br>he realised that what the man of God said was something he had never told anyone,
    <br>he had never disclosed his past life even to his own mother.
    <br>But when the word of prophecy came forth that there is a man with tattoes all over his body
    <br>who was a criminal, that touched his heart.
    <br>He came forward and ever since then, to the glory of God,
    <br>he has been completely free from that spirit that was disturbing him,
    <br>pushing him into crime, pushing him into taking drugs, selling drugs,
    <br>armed robbery and today he is a new man.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Tebogo & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So once again, we're just showing this so that people of God can really understand
    <br>the extent of what Jesus Christ has done for our brother,
    <br>and we give all the glory to God that today he is free.
    <br>Jesus Christ has set him free from that life that he was living before
    <br>and that spirit that was pushing him into such a life has completely
    <br>been cast out by our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>One more time, people, let's put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tebogo & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, my name is Regina Murake and I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I'm 57 years of age.
    <br>This is my son Tebogo.
    <br>He is quite a charming boy.
    <br>He was quite a charming boy when he grew up,
    <br>It happened that because I was staying with...
    <br>The man that I was staying with was not his father.
    <br>So it happened that he grew up with my father.
    <br>That is why most of the things that he said I don't know.
    <br>But I made it a point that he would get everything that he wanted.
    <br>I used to go to my place, to my father's place, and buy food for him,
    <br>made sure that he went to school and all that.
    <br>So the things that he said about being jailed several times -
    <br>I don't know about it - I only know about one incident.
    <br>That's when I went there and then I bailed him, he got out.
    <br>I tried to speak to him all the time.
    <br>When you spoke to him, it was like he listened, he understood
    <br>but immediately he went away, he did his own things there which I didn't know.
    <br>Actually, I knew that there was something wrong that he was doing
    <br>because there was a time when I was talking to him and he said,
    <br>"Mum, I need time to live my life, let me live my life."
    <br>because it was like I wanted him to live the way I wanted him to.
    <br>So I told him that it was okay, "But when things are not going well with you,
    <br>remember that you've got a mother and I will always accept you and help you".
    <br>So he went away because he was not staying with me,
    <br>by then he was staying at my other brother's house.
    <br>So he was staying there with his girlfriend.
    <br>All these things started and happened whilst he was there
    <br>because he was at the university.
    <br>And that was when I started to realise that there was something wrong that he was doing
    <br>and I always told him that there was something that was not right with him.
    <br>Then it took quite a time that he didn't come to me
    <br>because he said he wanted to live his own life.
    <br>The time he came back, he was full of tattoes.
    <br>I felt so bad because the first thing that he did was that he became a Rastafarian.
    <br>He used to have big dreadlocks and those things that they tie on their heads.
    <br>And I told him that I didn't like that but he said this was the life that he chose.
    <br>That's when he told me that he wanted to live his own life.
    <br>And then after quite a time, that was when he came now with tattoes all over his body.
    <br>For quite some time I knew that he needed help.
    <br>But I'm not a person who is used to witch doctors and all that.
    <br>Some people would advise me, "Go to so-and-so.
    <br>Your son needs deliverance, your son needs to be helped".
    <br>But I didn't know where to go, actually.
    <br>So five years back I got introduced to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And I started watching it and something told me that
    <br>this was where I was going to find a solution for myself and my son.
    <br>I needed deliverance for him.
    <br>It took me time to find a person who I could connect with so that we might come here.
    <br>After doing all the arrangements last year, I told him that I wanted him to come,
    <br>"There's a place that I want you to come with to.
    <br>It is a church and that's where you're going to be delivered
    <br>because I want you back, I want the son that I gave birth to.
    <br>Not you, you are not the son that I gave birth to, satan is using you".
    <br>He agreed, and then he said, "Okay, mum, I'll come on Saturday, alright?"
    <br>Saturday I waited for him - actually, he said he would come on Friday.
    <br>On Friday he didn't come; Friday night he said, "I will be there tomorrow morning".
    <br>And the next thing - tomorrow morning I received a message to say,
    <br>"Mum, I think I'm the one who caused these things to myself.
    <br>These are my problems. I will see to it that I sort myself out".
    <br>I was so disappointed, I didn't respond to that.
    <br>During early this year his children came to visit and he also came to visit
    <br>so I begged him to stay and sleep at home because he was not used to sleeping at my place.
    <br>He would come and go.
    <br>Because his children were there, we started sitting together,
    <br>and normally, my TV is always on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And we would see it and we would talk and fortunately,
    <br>most of the things that were coming up there,
    <br>were worse than what he thought he was doing.
    <br>He even said, "Things are worse than me, I'm better than these people who appear here.
    <br>I thought that I am the worst but I think I'm better".
    <br>So he gradually got to like it and then he disappeared again.
    <br>When you called him, he wouldn't pick up the phone - not at all.
    <br>So I didn't know what to do, but one day I decided to say, "I'm going to ask God.
    <br>I am definitely going to spend days asking God for him to agree to come to The SCOAN".
    <br>So I took days praying for that, over that and then finally one morning,
    <br>I woke up and then I decided that I was going to call him that day.
    <br>I started taking my books, reading my books and then I prayed.
    <br>After praying, I took my phone, sprayed the Morning Water on it
    <br>and said, "My God, God of T.B. Joshua, this boy is going to answer my phone today.
    <br>And he is going to come when I call him".
    <br>I wiped my phone so that it may not get damaged,
    <br>After that, I called him - he picked up the phone.
    <br>I said, "I want to see you. When can you come?"
    <br>He said, "Okay, I will come tomorrow".
    <br>And tomorrow morning, he was there.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Then when he came, I started telling him, "I am going to SCOAN in June".
    <br>Actually I was saying it was in June, I want to be there on the birthday of the prophet,
    <br>because mine is on the 16th, his is on the 19th of June.
    <br>I said I want us to be there.
    <br>And then I told him and then we stayed and we watched Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We spoke about a lot of things.
    <br>That's when I gave him money to go and do the passport.
    <br>After a few days, I called him because I knew how he was.
    <br>So I called him, "Did you make the passport?"
    <br>He said, "Yes, mum, I am just waiting for the call to say I must go and fetch it".
    <br>After two to three weeks I called him, "No, I haven't yet collected it".
    <br>Until finally he said, "You know, mum, I spent that money".
    <br>And I gave him another money for that.
    <br>And then I said, "Okay, this time I think you must come to that side so that we do it there".
    <br>He definitely did come, we did the passport,
    <br>he also didn't have his ID, we had to do another ID.
    <br>But from there I didn't trust him still, he went away,
    <br>he came back again and then when he came back,
    <br>we sat and then we watched Emmanuel TV.
    <br>One day I told him, "Our date has come out.
    <br>When can you be able to come because we are leaving in three days?"
    <br>He said, "Okay, I'll be there tomorrow".
    <br>The next morning at about 8 o'clock he appeared.
    <br>It was very early in the morning.
    <br>I looked at him but he was looking strange.
    <br>I just greeted him, and then I went
    <br>into another room.
    <br>When I came back, he was now okay and I said, "You definitely are ready"
    <br>because he had everything there.
    <br>That's when I started to realise that we were coming here.
    <br>And remember, I was also sick for three months.
    <br>I was very sick - all my joints.
    <br>I was always sleeping because I was very sick, I needed deliverance and healing too.
    <br>Fortunately, when I came here, I got healed.
    <br>The prophet touched me and then I got healed.
    <br>I was happy, I was healed and then of all of a sudden,
    <br>I didn't see the prophet touching him because I was all over the place by then.
    <br>But then I heard the prophet calling him, saying there is a man with tattoes and he is a thief.
    <br>I just jumped because I was seated at that side.
    <br>I just jumped and said, "Thank You, Lord. This is my day.
    <br>This is the day the Lord has made for me to get delivered and my son to be delivered".
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can really see, it was indeed God's time to restore this family completely.
    <br>Madam, ever since that prophecy and deliverance your son received,
    <br>can you just tell us the changes you have witnessed in his life?
    <br>Actually, we were privileged to stay for another week here at The SCOAN.
    <br>Free accommodation, free food.
    <br>That's when I realised that God is with us.
    <br>God is really with us and when we talked about it,
    <br>he was excited to say, "When I come out of here, I'll be perfect;
    <br>that other week is not just for fun.
    <br>It is really where God is working within us."
    <br>And then while we were staying here, he was always on his books, reading the Bible,
    <br>coming for classes and even in the class I would just look at him,
    <br>"What is he doing there?" - he was taking notes.
    <br>He was responding, he was asking questions.
    <br>And I said, "Now this is my boy!"
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We give all the glory to God for what He has done in the life of this family.
    <br>Madam, what is your word of advice to viewers around the world,
    <br>with what the Lord has done for you and your son?
    <br>My word of advice to the parents out there
    <br>is that it is quite important to stay with your children.
    <br>Be there for them. Yes, other people can look after your children.
    <br>Don't judge the situation that you are living in.
    <br>Make it a point that your children are always with you
    <br>so that you see every movement that they make.
    <br>Because I think if I was around him, he wouldn't have gone this far.
    <br>It was because I was not there most of the time,
    <br>and sometimes they wouldn't even tell me
    <br>that sometimes he was not sleeping at home because he was jailed and all that.
    <br>I didn't know why, it's just now that I hear about that.
    <br>So it is highly important that we stay with our children,
    <br>we teach our children about the Word of God,
    <br>we ensure that they are here next to us
    <br>and make sure that they come to church,
    <br>they know God, they work for God; we pray together and do everything together.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We just want to hear a final word from our brother as well.
    <br>My advice will be to my colleagues
    <br> and my friends out there.
    <br>I know some of them are watching me.
    <br>You know, out there, it's easier to die than to live.
    <br>Put your trust in God, even if you have problems -
    <br>some of the problems you can't handle them.
    <br>Just hand over all your problems to Jesus, only Jesus can change your life.
    <br>Thank You!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Just a final question, brother: You said before you had the impression
    <br>that perhaps because of your appearance with the tattoes
    <br>that you would be condemned or be looked down upon in the church.
    <br>What is your word of advice to people who may be watching right now with a similar thought
    <br>- they feel that perhaps, because of the way they look, their appearance,
    <br>they will not be accepted in the house of God.
    <br>What do you really want to advise such people as well?
    <br>Well, I'll say don't look at the outside, just look at the inside
    <br>because that's where God lies; he actually looks at the inside of a human being.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
