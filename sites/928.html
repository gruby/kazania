  <p>    
    <br>I want to see you sitting around the table with orphans,
    <br>eating with them and the elderly, giving them a kiss.
    <br>The one we can give to God through the needy,
    <br>the one you can give to God through the less privileged,
    <br>the one you can give to God through    
    <br> widows,
    <br>the one you can give to God through widowers,
    <br>the one you can give to God through physically challenged
    <br>is the one you will give with all your heart,
    <br>with a smile, without murmuring or complaining.
    <br>When you give it, you are giving it to God
    <br>and God will bless you in abundance.
    <br>Have you been doing that?
    <br>No.
    <br>You give with complaining.
    <br>You give with murmuring.
    <br>You are always complaining when you want to give;
    <br>even when you want to give tithe and now give it out.
    <br>You don't even need to talk.
    <br>Once it is change you received from the conductor,
    <br>once it is change you received from the petrol station,
    <br>once it is change, it is a way of saying, "Change"
    <br>and you receive change in return.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can't see God but you give the less privileged.
    <br>Through the less privileged to God.
    <br>It's God we are giving but through them.
    <br>He has no hands but our hands to do His work.
    <br>He has no legs but our legs to go where He wants to go.
    <br>He has no mouth to explain Himself How He was crucified
    <br>but our mouth to do that.
    <br>If you give in the name of Jesus, you will never regret.
    <br>But in the name of selfish, classic and material reasons,
    <br>for reasons known to you, you give this,
    <br>you will regret it because man can never be trusted.
    <br>The giving you have done in the past, you think it's lost;
    <br>it is not lost.
    <br>If it is in the name of God,
    <br>you will receive the reward at a time you need it most.
    <br>That is what has happened to many of you.
    <br>Sometimes you see help just come at the very time you need it.
    <br>But you have forgotten you have done it to someone in the past.
    <br>One can never get to any place or any position without genuine giving.
    <br>If you don't give your love genuinely,
    <br>you can never and you will never receive genuine love from people.
    <br>As you lay your bed, you sleep on it.
    <br>The more you give, the greater your money, if you give genuinely,
    <br>not giving whilst murmuring or complaining.
    <br>When you are giving it, you begin to complain,
    <br>"What will I eat? How will I go about it? What will happen to me next?"
    <br>That is, you have nullified the processing.
    <br>Begin to give. That is my life for you.
    <br>When you are giving, you have to believe God and trust Him
    <br>that He's the one you are giving to.
    <br>See your contribution as an assignment from God.
    <br>Look at what I'm doing now. I'm talking to you.
    <br>It is an assignment from God.
    <br>I'm looking at you. It is an assignment from God.
    <br>Give me your hand. It is an assignment from God.
    <br>I'm not seeing it as helping you
    <br>but as an assignment given to me from God.
    <br>And I'm not expecting a reward from you. God is my Rewarder.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you see it as an assignment from God,
    <br>you will not expect a reward from the person you are helping.
    <br>So, please give so that you will be very great.
    <br>Your greatness depends on your giving.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, My greatness depends on my giving.
    <br>When you give fast, you'll be great fast.
    <br>When you give slowly, you'll be great slowly.
    <br>When you give small, you'll be great small, small, small!
    <br>You're an angel of God!
    <br>An angel of God that gives love of God.
    <br>I'm an angel of God that gives love of God,
    <br>kindness of God, goodness of God, humility, faithfulness!
    <br>I'm an angel of God!
    <br>Be bold to say, I'm an angel of God!
    <br>I'm an angel of God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many of us here, in one way or the other,
    <br>you have accused some of our elderly to be witches or wizards.
    <br>Please, it is time to reconcile!
    <br>Attacks are meant for our spiritual benefit.
    <br>So, please, it is time to reconcile.
    <br>You have accused any of our mummy, daddy, elderly to be a witch or wizard
    <br>or some of the gods - the small small gods
    <br>which you created by yourself
    <br>and you now put it in the cupboard and worship it -
    <br>is now the one telling you, "This person is a witch, this one is a wizard".
    <br>Please, go back and say, sorry.
    <br>Give a kiss and put everything behind you.
    <br>Put it behind you.
    <br>Just put everything behind you.
    <br>And it is an opportunity now for those you have not been greeting
    <br>and they have not been greeting you,
    <br>you say, "Over my dead body, I will never greet them!" -
    <br>it is an opportunity for reconciliation!
    <br>Just go there, give them a call, "Oh, how are you? I miss you! Long time!"
    <br>"Who is on the line?"
    <br>"I miss you!" - keep saying, "I miss you!"
    <br>Even if satan hears, "I miss you!", he'll want to listen to you.
    <br>"I miss you!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give a call to those of whom you believe, "No, I will never call them!
    <br>I will never have anything to do with them!"
    <br>Give them a call!
    <br>Please.
    <br>If you can use this occasion to settle with people you see as your enemies,
    <br>the sky will be your limit.
    <br>If enemies can stop people, I would have been stopped.
    <br>They are there to test your faith.
    <br>Testing or attacks or challenges you are talking about is the beauty in our journey.
    <br>Anytime there is trouble that disturbs you, it is an opportunity to be promoted.
    <br>Instead, you think otherwise.
    <br>I know God has prepared you for this journey.
    <br>You can start doing the job on the phone.
    <br>People you have not been speaking to for many years,
    <br>for one reason or the other - please, make a phone call.
    <br>Rededicate yourself, please.
    <br>I declare here I have not done enough.
    <br>It is true that I give to the needy, less privileged, orphans
    <br>but I now realise that I have not done enough.
    <br>Rise up. Let me pray with you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your love for one another is not enough.
    <br>Your care for one another is not enough.
    <br>And what is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to cry to God.
    <br>Give me the grace, Lord, to love one another.
    <br>I want to be a cheerful giver.
    <br>Give me the grace, Lord.
    <br>A heart that loves, a heart that cares.
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>Like a flower needs the rain
    <br>Like a bird needs the wind
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>Like a flower needs the rain
    <br>Like a bird needs the wind
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>Like a flower needs the rain
    <br>Like a bird needs the wind
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Lord Jesus, give us a heart that loves, a heart that cares, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>God bless you, thank you.
