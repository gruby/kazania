  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Today is another day that the Lord has made.
    <br>And we want to do a little bit of good, to change the bad that we see.
    <br>Remember, love never gets tired of doing good because that love is the strength of God.
    <br>Like the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says, Love always looks around.
    <br>Love always searches to see who is in need.
    <br>That is what we're doing today, here in the United States of America; in the state of Ohio.
    <br>We have got a special event tonight whereby we will be going into the low income neighbourhoods
    <br>meeting some of the disabled and elderly and we will be providing them with some goods.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team sets up for the Charity Event.
    <br>As you can see right here, we've got some live produce; we have baskets of groceries.
    <br>The reason why we have baskets of groceries is because a lot of the elderly have expressed this to us,
    <br>that they really need some baskets for laundry as well.
    <br>So we were able to accomplish two things at once.
    <br>I am going to show you some of the things that we have here.
    <br>We have macaroni and cheese, chips, bread, eight pound bags of potatoes, bananas and water.
    <br>If you look over here, we have a Backpack Program for the youth.
    <br>We have the Emmanuel TV backpacks.
    <br>The Backpack Program has Emmanuel TV backpacks that have the words 'Keep watching Emmanuel TV" -
    <br>"Changing lives. Changing nations. Changing the world" - printed on them.
    <br>The bag also has all of the Emmanuel TV social media contacts on it - Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
    <br>It has the main website as well, Instagram and the Emmanuel TV email address on it.
    <br>We did this so that people could stay connected. This Backpack Program is for the students.
    <br>It is for Elementary, Middle School and High School students.
    <br>We got this Backpack Program for them because many of them are only able to eat at school during lunch.
    <br>Some of them can get breakfast but most of them don't. They are able to eat their lunch.
    <br>But many of them when they are coming back home are coming into an environment where there is no food.
    <br>Especially on the weekend. Therefore the man of God has made it possible,
    <br>and provided the resources. So that we can help the youth to stay healthy and not have to worry about food.
    <br>They can go ahead to school and get an education.
    <br>So we want to show you some of the goods that we have for the Backpack Program.
    <br>We make sure that they have water, healthy drinks, packs of oatmeal for a good breakfast.
    <br>We also provide cheese crackers; making sure that they have granola bars.
    <br>Over here we have some noodles, these are basically meals that they can quickly make for themselves.
    <br>We ensure they have boxes of cereal. To ensure they stay as healthy as possible, we have real cheese sticks.
    <br>We've provided yogurt packs. For meat, we've provided tuna cans and canned sausage.
    <br>One of the other things that the parents can help with is this vegetable barley soup.
    <br>That's already been put together. To prepare, the parents can just pour it all in.
    <br>This soup is enough to serve ten full meals.
    <br>It is very good. We have tried it ourselves and it is very delicious. It is a vegetable barley soup.
    <br>They are getting this kind of meal as well.
    <br>They will be getting pudding and other healthy little items.
    <br>Apple sauce and some snacks like graham crackers and fruit snacks as well.
    <br>They have more snacks like chips and so forth.
    <br>And that is what happens with the Backpack Program.
    <br>They will be able to take this back pack and be able to come every time they need food.
    <br>They will be able to come back with the backpack and we will be able to continue to fill it.
    <br>So that's what the Backpack Program is about. The Emmanuel TV Backpack.
    <br>Now I also want to show you what we will be having in the baskets as well. So come this way.
    <br>At the food pantry located inside the Emmanuel TV USA office,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV team removes frozen packs of meat from the deep freezer,
    <br>wearing protective masks and gloves.
    <br>Through the assistance of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>the pantry is always fully stocked with various food items,
    <br>in preparation to carry out Christ's mission to feed the needy.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team Prepares Packs Of Frozen Meat For Charity Event.
    <br>After being removed from the freezer, they tear open the larger packs of frozen meat.
    <br>One by one the frozen hamburger patties, chicken fingers, tenders and other meat,
    <br>are carefully placed into individual bags for each person who will receive them.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team give their quality time, quality love and quality care,
    <br>knowing that when you give love in truth, you are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to you.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team Prepares Packs Of Frozen Meat For Charity Event.
    <br>As Christians, we should spend more on others and less on ourselves.
    <br>That is the only way that we can commit more faith and love in the society of which we are a part.
    <br>Love looks around to see those who are in need. These packs of frozen meat are just one of the many items,
    <br>that the Emmanuel TV Team is planning to distribute to those in need.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team Prepares Packs Of Frozen Meat For Charity Event.
    <br>The book of James says that we must back up our faith with good deeds
    <br>for faith without good deeds is dead.
    <br>And our faith works by love. Therefore, we should love for God's sake and be loved.
    <br>Help for God's sake and be helped. Be kind for God's sake and receive kindness.
    <br>All this meat is going to be given away. This meat has hamburger patties, chicken fingers and tenders as well.
    <br>We have chicken patties also. We just have a whole lot of meat here.
    <br>That will do good for them as well.
    <br>You can see we have a whole bag full of meat. That's what we will be doing today.
    <br>We will be carrying you along and make sure you're able to see everything that is going on.
    <br>Emmanuel! (Matthew 1:23 - God is with us). Stay in faith.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team Lays Out Backpacks For Filling And Distribution.
    <br>The team effort continues inside the Emmanuel TV USA Office facilities.
    <br>As the Emmanuel TV Team lays out backpacks and baskets for the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program,
    <br>the blue Emmanuel TV backpacks are neatly arranged in an orderly manner on the floor.
    <br>Next up, it's time to fill the baskets with the food stuffs provided by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Bags of potatoes are the first items to be loaded into the baskets. Each basket gets its own bag.
    <br>These baskets are a two-fold blessing.
    <br>They're not only for carrying food items but can be reused for laundry purposes.
    <br>Here come some more food items. Ripe bananas - a good source of fibre and energy for the grateful receivers.
    <br>Loaves of bread are the next food item, followed by tortilla chips.
    <br>A variety of chips are available.

    <br>Emmanuel TV Team Gives Out Grocery Baskets And Cash Gifts.
    <br>Emmanuel, (God with us - Matthew 1:23) viewers! Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>And of course we're reporting live, all the way from the USA.
    <br>We're here in Ohio in the city of Middletown. I've got some very special guests with us right now.
    <br>I'm going to start by first asking his name. Brother, can you please tell me your name?
    <br>Jeff.
    <br>Ok Jeff, tell me where you're from?
    <br>I'm from Hamilton, Ohio.
    <br>I would like to ask you what you think about today.
    <br>You saw people coming to get some groceries and cash gifts.
    <br>There are about 80 apartments in this building and people came out by the masses and partook.
    <br>Tell me - how do you feel about that?
    <br>Well, I think it was a Godsent thing. And it was a blessing.
    <br>Some of us are struggling, not as fortunate as others. What you guys do is beautiful.
    <br>Thank you
    <br>Tell me the different people that we have here. We've got the disabled, and what other conditions are there?
    <br>We have the elderly, disabled, people that are unemployed, homeless
    <br>and people who are just struggling - scraping finger to toe - trying to make it everyday in life.
    <br>Just doing what we can to survive.
    <br>I noticed that some of the people that came and partook of the groceries and cash gifts are people that
    <br>came and helped other people as well. As far as staying with them.
    <br>There are one or two bedrooms, not mansions but many of you are taking in other people to stay with you, right?
    <br>Yes, this building is like an 84 or 86 apartment building.
    <br>Black, white, all different races - it doesn't matter - red, blue, green and yellow. We all stick together.
    <br>and whatever it takes, if I'm eating, you can eat and if I have a shirt, you don't have one,
    <br>you can get one and vice versa. We just look out for each other.
    <br>Great, that is what we saw. We saw everybody come and partake.
    <br>That goes without words.
    <br>I could never thank you enough, but T.B. Joshua, you are a blessing to us and many others.
    <br>God bless you for everything that you did.
    <br>Alright. You heard it from our brother and I want you to know that relationship is supposed to be for a lifetime.
    <br>I am hoping that this one will be.
    <br>So we will continue.
    <br>I would love that.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>You're welcome.
    <br>Emmanuel, (God with us - Matthew 1:23) viewers! Here we are once again and I have got a very special guest.
    <br>Of course today, we just had the event of being able to feed this housing development.
    <br>There are about 86 apartments in this building and a very special sister came aboard and began to help us.
    <br>She put her hands in and began to tote bags to different apartments of the ones that could not come down.
    <br>She took up the groceries and has done a great job. I will start by asking her name. Sister, what is your name?
    <br>My name is Eunice Thomas.
    <br>Tell me where are you from?
    <br>I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio.
    <br>Wow, Cincinnati, of course, is about 35 - 40 minutes from here.
    <br>Tell us about your experience today. What did you see?
    <br>People needed you.
    <br>It was a blessing that you guys came.
    <br>There are a lot of people struggling, like myself.
    <br>Some people have no income, some people are disabled, trying to get disability support, I'm a widow.
    <br>There are a lot of elderly people also and people with kids.
    <br>There are a lot of people that work but still can't make ends meet.
    <br>A lot of people team up in one household to try and make ends meet.
    <br>So anything that they can be helped with, they would be grateful.
    <br>Wow, you said a mouthful there. You said that you are a widow and are waiting for assistance to be helped.
    <br>So when you see charity organisations like this, it's a big help, right?
    <br>I appreciate it.
    <br>Before you came, I was really depressed and didn't know what today or tomorrow would bring.
    <br>When you came, it brightened me up. Thank you.
    <br>We thank you so much. The support comes all the way from Nigeria. From the man of God T.B. Joshua.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, thank you very much.
    <br>If there is anything I can do beyond this, don`t hesitate to contact me; I`m available.
    <br>My sister, we thank you so very much for putting your hands to the plow helping us in feeding everyone today.
    <br>Once again - Emmanuel (God With Us - Matthew 1:23), viewers!
    <br>We are right here in Middletown Ohio,  doing a little bit of good to change the bad we see.

    <br>Thank you, you too!
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team commences the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program,
    <br>delivering the Emmanuel TV Backpacks to students at the Lakota Pointe Government Housing Estate, Ohio, USA.
    <br>Emmanuel, viewers! Here we are in the West Chester area of Ohio, a subdivision of the Cincinnati area.
    <br>This is Lakota Pointe - a government housing project right across from the school.
    <br>This is one of the places where we are doing the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.
    <br>It is Friday, and we have come out and made sure that all of the youth have gotten a backpack,
    <br>with six different meals inside of them.
    <br>Many of them are from broken homes or homes where it's only the mother and themselves.
    <br>Therefore, it's all because of the generosity of the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>They have assisted us and provided the resources to be able to support them and to let them know
    <br>that they should stay in school.
    <br>That's the message from the man of God that they should stay in school.
    <br>When their purpose is clear, their life will have meaning. This is the message that we're passing on to them.
    <br>That when their purpose, their dreams and goals are clear then their life will have meaning.
    <br>And to also let them know to never underestimate the mind. That when you decide what you want to do,
    <br>then your mind will help you figure out how to do it.
    <br>So this is the message that we have been passing on to them and we will continue.
    <br>You've seen many of them get their Emmanuel TV Backpacks,
    <br>and every week we will continue to fill it up for them. Especially on the weekends,
    <br>we will fill it up for them because many of them only really eat when they go to school.
    <br>A lot of them when they come back home it's more of a challenge. Many of them are at home by themselves,
    <br>because being in single parent homes means that the parent is often at work.
    <br>Therefore, we are providing them with meals that are very easy to make by themselves.
    <br>Once again, Emmanuel! Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.
    <br>Remember, as we said before. We are passing on these encouraging words.
    <br>We have seen a lot of things happen from teen suicides to youth committing suicide and it is all because
    <br>many of them were affected by peer pressure. They did not measure up to one another's standards.
    <br>The message that we pass on is "don't allow yourself to be defined by the opinions of others".
    <br>"Love yourself, value yourself." - this is very important. We pass on the message that
    <br>the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Your dream is a photograph of your future".
    <br>That's right, your dream is a glimpse into your future. When you're going through hard times, it's that dream,
    <br>that will help sustain you through those troubled times.
    <br>We also pass on the message that you're born choosers and not losers.
    <br>You're born choosers and not losers. The decisions and the choices that they make everyday
    <br>will affect their tomorrow. These are the messages that we are passing on to these students
    <br>as we refill their backpacks through the Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.
    <br>Henry Ford said a hundred years ago that the only thing that matters
    <br>is if we made a difference in the life of a child.
    <br>And because of the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua, that's what is happening right now.
    <br>We're able to make a difference in the lives of these students, in the lives of these children.
    <br>Many of them are going home to single parent homes, coming from broken families as well.
    <br>We just want them to know and encourage them to stay in school.
    <br>We want you to know that, nothing is too big or too small; ever little bit counts.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.
    <br>Another thing that we want you to know is that in each backpack, every student has a small cash gift on the inside.
    <br>This is simply because we want to be a father to the fatherless.
    <br>We want to do our part in being a father to the fatherless. The brother to the brotherless.
    <br>We can be a sister to the sisterless. It is to show that every little bit counts.
    <br>You'll see that a lot of them sometimes look inside, then jump, smile and have a wild look on their face
    <br>because on the inside, we have made sure that they have a small cash gift.
    <br>These little things mean a lot.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.
    <br>Emmanuel! Indeed, God is wih us. We are here at Lakota Pointe - a subdivision of the Cincinnati area.
    <br>We've got a very special sister here.
    <br>Sister, can you tell me how old you are?
    <br>I am 15.
    <br>15. Wow. Can I get your name?
    <br>My name is Zaimir.
    <br>I was speaking with her and she let me know that her dreams and her goals are clear.
    <br>I want her to tell you what she's going to be.
    <br>I want to be an entrepreneur and I want to be the biggest WNBA basketball star.
    <br>I am a basketball fan and I believe I can fulfill that dream.
    <br>Yes, we believe that as well. We are sponsored and supported by someone that lets us know that,
    <br>when you decide what you want to do, then your mind will help you figure out how to do it.
    <br>It seems like you have decided on what you want to do so don't let anybody stop you from your dream and goal.
    <br>We will continue to come out and support you. Make sure you keep your Emmanuel TV Backpack
    <br>so we can keep supporting you every week. Ok.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So look into the camera and say Hello.
    <br>Hello!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Bye.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Backpack Program.
    <br>When we are in the business of giving charitably, I mean sowing into other people's lives,
    <br>God who is the dispenser of all good will give us, in His mercy, abundance of good
    <br>so that we might enjoy the sufficiency and abound in good works.
