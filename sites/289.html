  <p>    
    <br>Wise Man Racine moves throughout the auditorium, ministering prayer in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>and the power of God is released to the scene.
    <br>People are receiving deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The name Jesus Christ has power indeed,
    <br>but only among those who are committed to the glory of God.
    <br>As Wise Man Racine ministered to the people, he encountered this man,
    <br>and the evil spirit that was responsible for his problems is exposed.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I have told you before.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I have told you, you can't take him from me.
    <br>Who are you? Speak to me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I am the spirit from the family.
    <br>How do you operate as a spirit of the family in the life of this man?
    <br>I have stopped many of them.
    <br>He is the last man standing.
    <br>How did you stop them?
    <br>Two of his uncles were men of God.
    <br>I made them to be useless.
    <br>How?
    <br>They are even dead.
    <br>How?
    <br>And look at him, he was working for me.
    <br>He was working for you?
    <br>And now, he says he wants to serve God.
    <br>He's a great man but I have messed him up.
    <br>I frustrated his ministry.
    <br>How did you frustrate the ministry?
    <br>You know it.
    <br>Explain! How?
    <br>- You want to know?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>He will gather the crowd.
    <br>He will pray for people.
    <br>He will heal many.
    <br>They will go and give testimony somewhere else.
    <br>His church will go down.
    <br>He will struggle and he will go down.
    <br>I have frustrated him.
    <br>I want him to leave the ministry to serve me.
    <br>How do you operate in the life of this man?
    <br>How I operate?
    <br>I made him to be angry.
    <br>I sent one of my demons - anger.
    <br>When I frustrate him, he becomes angry
    <br>and when he becomes angry, he gets discouraged
    <br>and he doesn't work for his Master anymore.
    <br>So, you entered him through anger?
    <br>Yes, I entered him.
    <br>I sent the spirit of anger in him.
    <br>You can't stop me because I have stayed here for long.
    <br>He will not become what that Man wants him to be.
    <br>Which Man?
    <br>The Man up there.
    <br>Which Man?
    <br>You don't know Him?
    <br>Name Him. What is His name?
    <br>We are not authorized to call that Name.
    <br>Why?
    <br>What does that Name do to you?
    <br>The Name shakes the kingdom.
    <br>It shakes your kingdom?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What else have you done to this man?
    <br>I have raised people in the community and everywhere he goes,
    <br>they look at him and see nothing.
    <br>He's a fighter but I will not let him.
    <br>- A fighter?
    <br>- Yes, he is a fighter.
    <br>He loves God.
    <br>He has sacrificed.
    <br>He is the last born of the family.
    <br>Out of six, I killed the rest of them.
    <br>Just him, the last born.
    <br>He wants to shine.
    <br>He is the only one who tried to get married.
    <br>Look at this small boy, he cannot become...
    <br>What have you done to his family?
    <br>- His family?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>His family - fighting, quarrelling.
    <br>I am on the verge of breaking the marriage.
    <br>Who is this woman?
    <br>- Who?
    <br>- This woman.
    <br>Who is she?
    <br>She's one of your members.
    <br>You don't know her?
    <br>She is one of your members.
    <br>Madam, you are welcome.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>What can you say about him?
    <br>He has anger.
    <br>He gets very angry and it affects even the people of the church.
    <br>How?
    <br>When he gets angry, he talks angrily to the people
    <br>and some of them leave the church because of his anger.
    <br>Even me, he threatens me.
    <br>- He threatens you?
    <br>- Yes, he tells me that I am a witch.
    <br>That I am the one making people leave the church
    <br>and he tells me that he does not want to hear my voice.
    <br>Sometimes, he doesn't want me to minister.
    <br>He tells me that I am a witch.
    <br>All the time he says I am a witch.
    <br>Madam, it is not him but that spirit.
    <br>Come here.
    <br>Explain again - how did you enter this man?
    <br>How did you manage to enter him?
    <br>How did I manage to enter him?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>When he was a young boy.
    <br>I saw a light and he was living with one of his aunties.
    <br>The auntie was a prostitute.
    <br>When the mother died, the auntie took him
    <br>and then, we took advantage of the light.
    <br>When he was living with his auntie who was doing prostitution,
    <br>we took advantage and we entered him.
    <br>Then, we knew that he would come to deliver the family.
    <br>Now, we will stop him because he came here because he has tried
    <br>and cannot and now you are asking me, "Who am I?"
    <br>Do you know who I am?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>You want to know me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You want to know me?
    <br>Look at me.
    <br>I am the great one.
    <br>- The great one?
    <br>- Yes!
    <br>What do you mean by "the great one"?
    <br>- You want to know?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>The great one.
    <br>I have worked in that family and in their family, nobody is rising.
    <br>I have made them to be nothing.
    <br>He is coming to your God and he is giving all.
    <br>He abandoned us.
    <br>I said that if he continues serving that God, I will kill him.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>Jesus Christ is greater than you.
    <br>Today, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>I command you demon to leave this man forever - come out.
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come here, sir.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine, sir.
    <br>This is your wife?
    <br>Yes, this is my wife. We came here together.
    <br>Do you remember what you have just said?
    <br>Sorry, sir.
    <br>Do you remember what you have said?
    <br>I said she is my wife.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>Sir, it's so embarrassing!
    <br>I am embarrassed now.
    <br>I am not properly dressed.
    <br>What brought you here?
    <br>Listen to me:
    <br>Jesus Christ of Nazareth has cast out that demon, that unclean spirit
    <br>that was destroying your life and your destiny.
    <br>You are free today, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Madam, that spirit of anger, that evil spirit - Jesus has cast it out.
    <br>He is no longer the same person.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Don't remind him of his past; his past is over.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Apostle and Prophetess Tabe.
    <br>We come from Cameroon.
    <br>We are the pastors of Dominion Christian Centre.
    <br>The problems that brought us to The SCOAN were setback, depression
    <br>and oppression in our lives, the ministry and our family.
    <br>By the grace of God, I have been a pastor for more than ten years.
    <br>However, things had not been going well.
    <br>We would have great programmes; thousands of people would gather.
    <br>They would come to the church but in the space of one month, they would be gone.
    <br>We would pray for people for healing and deliverance
    <br>but they would go and give a testimony somewhere else.
    <br>Those same people would not come to church anymore.
    <br>This had been going on for more than 10 years.
    <br>As a man of God, I had been praying and fasting.
    <br>We put our hands together and said, "We need to pray".
    <br>We would ask what was happening and why our life was like that.
    <br>"Look at this one; we prayed for them. But what is happening to us?"
    <br>We knew that there was something more than us that we didn't understand.
    <br>My wife and I agreed to come.
    <br>I discovered that every time we tried to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>there would be one problem or the other or a misunderstanding.
    <br>Before we knew it, the journey would be postponed.
    <br>But when this year began, we decided that we were not going to sit down
    <br>and take up the ministry just like that; we needed to come to The SCOAN
    <br>because we believed that God had something to say concerning our situation.
    <br>When we came here last week Sunday,
    <br>we were privileged to be inside the church.
    <br>We sat down under the gallery.
    <br>When prayer was going on after the praise and worship,
    <br>when the wise men came out, they were praying and ministering deliverance.
    <br>Wise Man Racine came to the row where I was praying.
    <br>Before he came, I was normal.
    <br>There was a kind of weight upon me; I felt heavy.
    <br>When he came, he laid his hand on me and I felt a burning sensation in my body.
    <br>There was a reaction.
    <br>I felt something leave me.
    <br>Right there, I knew that something was wrong with me.
    <br>While the prayer and deliverance was going on,
    <br>I discovered that there was an evil spirit from my family that had taken hold,
    <br>not only of my life but that of my family's.
    <br>It had held me all these years.
    <br>I discovered that the evil spirit even said that two of my uncles -
    <br>it had stopped them and killed them, that they would not fulfil their ministries.
    <br>When I thought about it, I realised that it was true:
    <br>two of my uncles were pastors.
    <br>I grew up as a young man; they loved the Lord but they were nothing,
    <br>even till their death.
    <br>I never understood what was happening.
    <br>When my mother died, I was taken to my auntie in one of the cities in Cameroon
    <br>and she was a prostitute.
    <br>The evil spirit said that it had taken advantage of me.
    <br>I discovered that when I was in the city of Douala as a young man,
    <br>living with my auntie, whenever she had business, we would go out for a stroll.
    <br>At 12 midnight, I would still be out as a young man with some bad boys who would be smoking.
    <br>I even discovered that I had pierced a hole in my ear;
    <br>there was an earring there.
    <br>From that time when you were growing up with your aunt,
    <br>what were the other things you passed through,
    <br>before your coming here to The SCOAN?
    <br>When I was with my aunt, seeing that she was doing prostitution,
    <br>I was just living a life that was not pleasing to God
    <br>and became born again thereafter.
    <br>I loved the Lord, I was serving the Lord, I was faithful
    <br>and I received the call to serve the Lord.
    <br>I discovered that when I was with my auntie, something had happened
    <br>because this spirit had haunted my family.
    <br>We were six children - all the others are dead; I am the last born.
    <br>As a young man, because they saw that people were dying,
    <br>my auntie took us to a shrine where incisions were made on our bodies.
    <br>They said they wanted to protect us from an evil spirit so that we would not die.
    <br>They cut marks in my legs and hands, took the blood and put it on a black stone.
    <br>I was so innocent; I never knew what was happening.
    <br>I thought it was protection.
    <br>And then, we went.
    <br>As I was still a Christian, growing in the Lord, I received the call of God
    <br>and I was doing the work of God but things were not going well.
    <br>Things were not moving.
    <br>Great crusades, people would gather, miracles but in my own life, nothing to show forth.
    <br>People would say, "Great man of God! Sir, you are wonderful."
    <br>But if you looked at me and looked at everything around, what was wonderful?
    <br>They were taking the church from one court to another.
    <br>At one time I asked, "What is this problem?"
    <br>I told my wife, "It is not by force. If I am not a pastor, I can still be a Christian."
    <br>The spirit was telling me, "Leave! Don't do this work; don't do it.
    <br>You can see it is not working."
    <br>It came to a point that I said to myself, "It was not by force to be a pastor."
    <br>I said that I just wanted to be a normal Christian.
    <br>Everytime, I was saying that I was not a pastor.
    <br>That thing became very heavy upon me.
    <br>My wife was then saying, "You just need to pray more."
    <br>I knew that I was no longer interested in ministry because what I saw,
    <br>the kind of challenges I was having were not natural ones
    <br>and from that moment, we agreed to come to The SCOAN for deliverance.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Can you tell us how this spirit affected your family, relationship with your wife and your marriage?
    <br>That spirit had actually affected my relationship because
    <br>I discovered that my uncles, who were pastors, married two wives each.
    <br>As a young man, I grew up to ask, "How can a pastor have two wives?"
    <br>I discovered that the urge of getting another woman was really strong;
    <br>it was just 99.1 percent; I just needed to get another wife
    <br>because there were no feelings.
    <br>I had no feelings for my wife.
    <br>I mean to say that for ten years, we have been married, this is the eleventh year,
    <br>and things were not moving, we have no child.
    <br>I know that spirit was responsible for my childlessness.
    <br>The kind of feelings that I had for my wife
    <br>were not like the feelings of a husband and wife.
    <br>We would hide it, when we came outside, "Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Glory to God!"
    <br>but when we went back inside the house, it was 'Tom and Jerry'.
    <br>We were quarrelling for nothing.
    <br>We were just quarrelling and this had affected my ministry;
    <br>it had affected my life as a man of God.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>You are here today, and that is what brought you to The SCOAN.
    <br>Tell us, sir, since your deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ - how has life been?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>If you are happy with this testimony, praise the Lord!
    <br>You don't know what I had gone through.
    <br>If you knew what I had gone through, you would jump up and shout hallelujah with me.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>[Hallelujah!]
    <br>Before I came here, you would look at the man,
    <br>"Oh! A wonderful man of God - handsome, great"
    <br>but you wouldn't know what was wrong with me, what was killing me within.
    <br>I never knew how to get rid of it.
    <br>I had fasted, prayed in my own capacity but when I came here,
    <br>since the prayer of the wise man,
    <br>in my life, the urge of leaving the ministry,
    <br>the urge of going out of ministry has left me.
    <br>There is a burning passion to serve the Lord upon me.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>For my wife, she can testify because in our relationship, we were just like people
    <br>who knew each other on the road but now, I feel like a married man.
    <br>I feel like a father.
    <br>I feel like I have a companion by my side.
    <br>I feel there is somebody by my side.
    <br>My wife and I feel as if we have just entered into a new marriage and
    <br>I know that it is a new marriage after my deliverance.
    <br>I know it is a new ministry after my deliverance.
    <br>I know that I am a new person after my deliverance.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I want to say this.
    <br>I have received more than 80 calls since last week.
    <br>The whole of Cameroon, as I am talking, is watching me.
    <br>Calls had been coming in, "Man of God, we are waiting for you."
    <br>I thought, "Is it me?"
    <br>Things have just been wonderful because I know this is God.
    <br>I want to say this: The Bible says pride goes before a fall.
    <br>As a man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua said something.
    <br>God looks at our spirit, that is, the spirit of humility.
    <br>I discovered that many of us men of God have an attitude or character problem because we think,
    <br>"I am a man of God. I am anointed, it is God who called me.
    <br>I don't need anybody to deliver me; God will deliver me"
    <br>but my Bible tells me that by a prophet, Israel was preserved
    <br>and by a prophet, Israel was delivered.
    <br>I believe in this dispensation, God has sent His servant,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua as a prophet for the deliverance and liberation of God's people.
    <br>I want to advise my fellow ministers.
    <br>You would agree with me that graces are given to each and everyone
    <br>according to their measure of faith.
    <br>You know; you are listening to me, you know.
    <br>You have prayed, you have fasted like me.
    <br>It is time to identify a higher grace and trust in God for your deliverance
    <br>just like I did.
    <br>Come out of your pride, collar and title.
    <br>You might be a bishop, an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist -
    <br>I want you to know that God is interested in your life, not in your title.
    <br>If you carry your title and are claiming not to be delivered,
    <br>just like me before I entered into the ministry, I was not truly delivered.
    <br>But now I know there is a new page in my life, my family and my ministry.
    <br>I want to advise you, trust God.
    <br>Don't come to The SCOAN just to look at the man of God,
    <br>the beauty of the place or the people;
    <br>come and connect your spirit with the spirit of the man of God.
    <br>Iron sharpeneth iron and I know your life will not remain the same again.
    <br>APOSTLE RECEIVES DELIVERANCE FROM FAMILIAR SPIRIT!!!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life and the wonderful thing God has done for you and your family.
    <br>We want to encourage you; as you make God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>God Almighty will continue to give you the mercy and favour
    <br>you have begun to walk in in this ministry, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I want to testify one more thing.
    <br>Before I came here, I had lost my voice for two years.
    <br>I had an album and people would say, "Oh, it is good" but nobody was buying it.
    <br>That spirit had hindered my life.
    <br>I discovered that in those days when I was singing,
    <br>there was healing and deliverance but I felt that my voice was gone.
    <br>But after my deliverance, I began to wonder, "Was this me?"
    <br>I wanted to record my voice.
    <br>My voice now is like a refined voice.
    <br>When I sing, I can hear myself
    <br>and know that the Holy Spirit is speaking through me.
    <br>I was saying that if the privilege was given to me,
    <br>I still want to sing one song for the glory of God
    <br>because what God has done for me, no amount of money can pay for it.
    <br>Glory
    <br>Glory to the Lamb
    <br>Glory
    <br>Glory to the Lamb
    <br>For You are glorious
    <br>And worthy to be praised
    <br>The Lamb upon the throne
    <br>And You shall reign
    <br>In righteousness forever
    <br>You are the Lamb upon the throne
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God,
    <br>tears of joy are running down from my eyes.
    <br>We have gone through a lot and this is the day, time, season
    <br>that the Lord has made for us to cross over the bridge.
    <br>It is our time and our season that the Lord has made.
    <br>My name is Prophetess Blessing Dora Tabe.
    <br>We are pastors of Dominion Christian Centre in Cameroon.
    <br>We came here because of oppression, stagnation and difficulties in our ministry
    <br>and in our lives; things had not been working.
    <br>Before now, we had been saying that we would come to The SCOAN
    <br>but there was no way, no money for us to come.
    <br>Sometimes, we were wondering, "God, how are we going to do it?"
    <br>But I knew in spirit that one day, we would come here.
    <br>Early last year, I had a dream that Prophet T.B. Joshua came to our church
    <br>and he was preaching.
    <br>While he was preaching, he stopped at one point and started prophesying.
    <br>Suddenly, a python appeared in the corner of the church.
    <br>Then, a hand came and killed the python.
    <br>He prayed for me two times.
    <br>I had been so oppressed in my spirit.
    <br>I told my husband that this was the time for us to go to The SCOAN at all costs.
    <br>I told him that "Whether there was money or no money, we will go there."
    <br>Because I had seen this, I prayed with Prophet T.B. Joshua, touching the screen.
    <br>When he was praying, I would lay my hands on the television.
    <br>I had been praying for ourselves, for the church
    <br>and I knew that one day, God would bring us here.
    <br>When we got here, Wise Man Racine prayed for my husband
    <br>and the spirit manifested.
    <br>Everything the spirit said was true
    <br>because all along, the spirit had used my husband to accuse me that
    <br>I was a witch in the church, causing all the people to go.
    <br>It was such a burden on me.
    <br>Sometimes, I told him that I would leave the church, travel or go out
    <br>maybe for one year so that the church could be intact
    <br>so that people would not go anymore.
    <br>Each time, the Spirit of God would come to me and say,
    <br>"No. Stand, wait and see what I will do."
    <br>I would tell my husband that "This thing is more than us.
    <br>We have to go for deliverance."
    <br>Everytime I would say, "Let us go and seek the face of a man of God,"
    <br>I would think about some men of God around us
    <br>but my spirit would not allow me.
    <br>I'd tell him that we would come to The SCOAN only.
    <br>As I had that dream last year, I said that this was the place God was sending us.
    <br>No matter what, we would go
    <br>and I know that this was the beginning of our deliverance
    <br>and that spirit that used to come to us in dreams where we were sleeping,
    <br>there was a snake that came to us.
    <br>At one time, I told my husband that a python came to us as we were sleeping
    <br>and in that dream, you did nothing; the python came and passed.
    <br>I saw that God was protecting us.
    <br>He even said that there was a woman coming to his dreams to sleep with him.
    <br>All those things were hindrances that the spirit was doing
    <br>to stop us from going forward.
    <br>Nothing was moving, no money - nothing.
    <br>The ministry was going up and down.
    <br>People were coming and going and all the blame was on me.
    <br>I told my husband that I thought in the arena of liberty, The SCOAN,
    <br>God was going to visit us and the truth was going to come out about this matter.
    <br>I thank the Lord for His deliverance upon our lives.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I want to advise ministers of God.
    <br>They should stand, no matter what they see and serve the Lord.
    <br>There is a way that God would show
    <br>because Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.
    <br>God had shown us the way and He brought us here to receive our total deliverance
    <br>because our efforts could not do anything and we saw that we were depreciating.
    <br>We were frustrated and people were mocking us.
    <br>I want to tell women of God who are standing by their husbands,
    <br>when they see that things are not moving, they should stand because I stood.
    <br>Even my family members asked me, "What are you doing with that man?
    <br>He is nothing; leave him. Nothing will work there."
    <br>Even other men of God had rejected us but I tell you,
    <br>men and women of God out there, stand and see the salvation of the Lord!
    <br>If it is not going, come to the arena of liberty
    <br>and you will receive your deliverance, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for the wonderful thing God Almighty has done in your life
    <br>and we encourage you as you continue to make God's Word the standard for your life;
    <br>the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
