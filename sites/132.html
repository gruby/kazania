  <p>    
    <br>WARNING!
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Wounded and obviously in pain,
    <br>this woman was involved in a car accident that injured her face.
    <br>As you look closer, you can see that stitches were done in two places,
    <br>indicating that the cuts were very deep and taking time to heal.
    <br>Not only her face was injured in the accident.
    <br>Her arm was also severely damaged
    <br>and in some places the skin was completely gone
    <br>and only gaping wounds remained.
    <br>The flesh of her arm was torn open and you can almost see the bone.
    <br>Would she be able to take her bath?
    <br>Would she be able to move without pain?
    <br>This is the reason why she has come to The SCOAN in search of the Healer, Jesus Christ.
    <br>You are very welcome to The SCOAN in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Hannah Olayiwola.
    <br>I am 38 years old.
    <br>What is the reason why you came to The SCOAN?
    <br>I had a body injury when I was in an accident.
    <br>We were in a bus and a motorbike crossed in front of us
    <br>and that was how the accident happened.
    <br>How has this problem affected your life?
    <br>I have pain.
    <br>My body is hurting me all over.
    <br>What did the doctor say about your condition?
    <br>The doctor said that I should go for an operation on my left arm.
    <br>Now that you are here at The SCOAN, what do you believe God can do for you?
    <br>I know that God is able to do everything.
    <br>God will heal me.
    <br>We pray with you that God will heal you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mrs Hannah Olayiwola in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>her body begins to shake under the influence of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>just as a drunk under the control of wine.
    <br>The power of resurrection in that name, Jesus Christ, is flowing through her,
    <br>repairing every damaged part of her body.
    <br>She falls from her seat, as Jesus Christ is busy working out the answer,
    <br>busy taking her out of her problem and she shall not go back, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>After the prayer of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, she stands to her feet
    <br>and immediately exercises her arm.
    <br>Soon after her healing through the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>Hannah Olayiwola came back to The SCOAN to show how Jesus Christ healed her wounds
    <br>proving that He is indeed the healing Provider.
    <br>On the left you can see the terrible condition of her flesh
    <br>severely damaged as a result of an accident,
    <br>and on the right you can see her arm completely healed.
    <br>No more pain.
    <br>Only a small scar remains as a testimony or reminder of her encounter with Jesus Christ.
    <br>To God be the glory; she can now live her life freely for the glory of God.
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>- Are you feeling any pain?
    <br>- No, not at all.
    <br>Before, I could not touch it.
    <br>I could not even stretch my hand, my hand was stiff before
    <br>but now I am able to stretch it and carry anything with it.
    <br>Before, I could not see well with my left eye, but after the prayer everything is alright.
    <br>I can see clearly.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Hannah Olayiwola.
    <br>My testimony goes like this.
    <br>I had a body injury due to a car accident.
    <br>When I had the accident, the pain was so severe that I could not do anything.
    <br>My body and arms were stiff.
    <br>I could not do anything with my arms.
    <br>Somebody brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was in the prayer line and the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.
    <br>Immediately the man of God prayed for me,
    <br>the pain I had on my body and left eye was gone.
    <br>Since I received my healing, I can stretch my arms.
    <br>When I had the accident, I could not see well
    <br>and water used to come out of my eyes.
    <br>Immediately the man of God prayed for me, I could stretch my arms.
    <br>You can see on the screen that the arm was stiff.
    <br>Immediately the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me,
    <br>I could stretch my arms, the water stopped coming out of my eyes and the pain left.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah. We thank God for what Jesus Christ has done for you.
    <br>When I had this body injury, I could not sleep.
    <br>I had pains all over my body.
    <br>You can see me on the screen that I was not myself.
    <br>Because of the pain, I could not sleep.
    <br>Throughout the night, I would be crying
    <br>because of the pain that I had on my arms.
    <br>Immediately Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, that night,
    <br>I was able to sleep sound, without any problem.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We thank God; what seemed to be impossible for men, God has done it for you.
    <br>Can you please, for the benefit of our viewers, tap your hands and affected areas,
    <br>showing the world that you are indeed healed, in the name of Jesus Christ?
    <br>- Do you feel any pain as you are tapping your skin?
    <br>- No pain.
    <br>Can you please tell us for how long have you been in good condition like this,
    <br>ever since you received a prayer...?
    <br>For 11 years, I have been OK.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That means it was 11 years ago that you came here to The SCOAN and you received your healing.
    <br>For the past 11 years you have been in a very good health and very well.
    <br>- Is that right?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Wow. To God be the glory.
    <br>- Hallelujah.
    <br>Madam, can you just please move around to show to these people waiting to receive their healing
    <br>that indeed Jesus Christ is the Healer and there is never a Healer like Jesus Christ?
    <br>HEALING TAKING PLACE IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES!!!
    <br>My message to you people is to believe.
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>When the man of God prays for you, believe that you are healed.
    <br>Wow. What a wonderful message our mother is giving us here.
    <br>Indeed, she encouraged everyone of us to have faith in God.
    <br>It is not all up to Jesus for you to receive your healing,
    <br>and certainly it is not all up to us to receive our healing
    <br>but we have a role to play, that is to have faith in God.
    <br>Remember that faith is the channel through which the anointing flows.
    <br>Madam, thank you very much for sharing with us your wonderful testimony.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will grant you the inner grace
    <br>to maintain your healing, so it will remain permanent in your life,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, mighty Jesus!
