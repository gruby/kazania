    <br>THE UNWELCOME BEGINNING!!! | Angela Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Happy Birthday, Emmanuel TV!
    <br>A million thanks are not enough for Jesus Christ
    <br>who made it possible for us to be together in His name.
    <br>A million thanks are not enough for Jesus Christ
    <br>who gave us the medium of Emmanuel TV whereby millions of viewers around the world
    <br>can join us together in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let us give thanks to Almighty God, as we have our seats in the presence of the Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>I don't know if you saw the recent news.
    <br>Last year a famous painting was sold - a Picasso.
    <br>The new owner invited art collectors from across the country to admire his new painting.
    <br>He was shocked when he discovered it was a counterfeit.
    <br>He had spent millions for it.
    <br>Months later a grandmother passed away in her farmhouse.
    <br>Among the belongings they auctioned off was an old discarded picture.
    <br>Her family was shocked to discover it was an original.
    <br>For years they had treated it as nothing.
    <br>People of God, this is what the devil has done in our lives.
    <br>He wants fake to stand in the place of truth and darkness to stand in the place of light
    <br>so that no one can find their way to their true value.
    <br>But you are an original; satan has a photocopy.
    <br>He is trying to get you at all costs.
    <br>He is trying to cover your worth and value, destroy your destiny and sell you off as a counterfeit.
    <br>People of God, we should not make this easy for the devil.
    <br>Satan desires to have you as he begged permission from God to have Job
    <br>but this time he is starting from the womb.
    <br>Remember the warrior Gideon; he once questioned his value
    <br>because of the family he was born into.
    <br>In Judges 6 he said, "But my clan is the weakest and I am the least in my family."
    <br>Moses once complained about the disability he was born with.
    <br>In Exodus 4 he said, "But I have never been eloquent. I am slow of speech and tongue."
    <br>Even Prophet Jeremiah once questioned his weak beginnings.
    <br>In Jeremiah 1 he said, "I do not know how to speak. I am too young."
    <br>Satan showed them the circumstance of their birth and almost sold their destiny.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't let satan sell you off as a counterfeit."
    <br>I remember a story my father told me on my 21st birthday.
    <br>The family had come together to celebrate.
    <br>We were sharing stories of how God had rescued us from our crazy childhood
    <br>and my dad decided to tell me the story of my birth,
    <br>the circumstances concerning my birth.
    <br>He started, "Angela, I'm so glad you are having such a happy birthday
    <br>because you were always such a sad little baby."
    <br>I was sad?
    <br>So I asked him, "How do you know I was sad? I was just a baby."
    <br>And he answered, "Because you cried all the time.
    <br>You cried and cried; until you were almost five, everything you did was in tears."
    <br>My family had raised me in church.
    <br>You may have even seen them here inTthe Synagogue or at a crusade with us.
    <br>This is the evidence of God's love in their life, and we love each other very much.
    <br>My dad explained that when they first married, they were very young
    <br>and they prayed for a baby, and God blessed them with a sweet adorable daughter -
    <br>my older sister - there she is.
    <br>They were happy, complete, the family they had always dreamt about becoming.
    <br>But suddenly, the honeymoon ended, marriage became difficult,
    <br>money became tight and my sister was still in diapers,
    <br>when my mother announced, "We've had an accident."
    <br>My dad was so upset; he said he ran out of the house.
    <br>My mom locked herself in the room crying.
    <br>They were wondering, "How are we going to manage another baby?"
    <br>And unexpectedly three became four.
    <br>Another mouth to feed, another diaper to change, another baby to clothe.
    <br>This is me and my sister and my mom.
    <br>And there she sat, crying and crying and crying...
    <br>What my dad said was true; I spent my childhood crying.
    <br>So that night I asked my father, "Why was I crying?"
    <br>He looked at me and said, "I think you knew we didn't want you then."
    <br>And it was true then.
    <br>Look across the globe:
    <br>forty percent of all births are unwanted and unintended.
    <br>Over one hundred and fifty million children right now are orphaned and abandoned.
    <br>The second leading cause of death among the young is suicide,
    <br>with hundreds of thousands of people taking their lives each year.
    <br>What has happened to you?
    <br>I don't know if you were an unintended child - unplanned, unwanted, unwelcome.
    <br>I don't know if you were a child born by violence, by force or by accident.
    <br>But I do know the circumstance of your birth can never reduce
    <br>or remove your worth and value in the sight of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Psalm 139 the Psalmist spoke to our Creator.
    <br>He said in verse 15:
    <br>"My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place,
    <br>when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
    <br>Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me
    <br>were written in your book before one of them came to be."
    <br>You are a work of art.
    <br>We cannot compare you with any other creation
    <br>because you were to be master over all creation.
    <br>You are created in the image and likeness of God,
    <br>to resemble God in everything that makes Him who He is,
    <br>to represent Him in everything He stands for, to rule, act, plan and be one with God.
    <br>You were created to live by design, not by default.
    <br>This is God's plan for you, whether man planned for you or not.
    <br>This is God's will and intention for your life, whether any man intended you or not.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You were created to live by design, not by default."
    <br>But so often today we judge ourselves, we limit ourselves,
    <br>we determine the level we should reach based on how others treat us,
    <br>what others have done to us, the situation we grew up under
    <br>and the environment we found ourselves in.
    <br>We ask, "Can any good thing come from an unwelcome beginning?"
    <br>And this will lead us to today's message:
    <br>THE UNWELCOME BEGINNING
    <br>Look around the world today.
    <br>We may say that seventy percent of all successful people were unintended children.
    <br>Look into the lives of your presidents, your leaders, influential people today
    <br>and you will find an unwelcome beginning.
    <br>How many first wandered as illegals, refugees, homeless, addicts and prostitutes?
    <br>How many climbed the ladder of success from the pit of hopelessness and obscurity?
    <br>How many were unintended children?
    <br>Ask your leaders and they will tell you.
    <br>Let us ask Joseph and let's understand what really happened to Joseph.
    <br>In Genesis 37 we see that Joseph was one of 12 sons
    <br>but after a fight with his brothers he was kicked out of his house.
    <br>We remember his father's last words, "My son is dead to me."
    <br>This was to make Joseph a victim of a broken home.
    <br>Sold on the market, Joseph was driven across the desert
    <br>and forced to labour in a foreign land - this was to make Joseph a victim of trafficking.
    <br>Inside the house one afternoon, Joseph was attacked by a woman
    <br>and forced to run to the streets naked - this was to make Joseph a victim of domestic violence.
    <br>Imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, he was abandoned for years in the prison cell -
    <br>this was to make Joseph a victim of the system.
    <br>Satan's whole aim is to make you his victim.
    <br>He works to offend you, to lie against you, to draw you to sin
    <br>and trap you to eternal ruin and he is using the circumstance of your birth as a bait.
    <br>And today the home, which is meant to be a shelter of provision and protection and growth,
    <br>where we learn to give and receive love, is often the root of our pain.
    <br>Make no mistake about it;
    <br>the devil takes delight in inflicting pain on people.
    <br>He wants you to curse God while under trial, pain and affliction
    <br>and be numbered among those abandoned to the grave.
    <br>He wants you to cry out as the Psalmist did in Psalm 88:3-5.
    <br>The Psalmist said:
    <br>"I am overwhelmed with troubles and my life draws near to death.
    <br>I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like one without strength.
    <br>I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave,
    <br>whom you remember no more, who are cut off from your care."
    <br>Pain distorts our vision and brings us to view God and ourselves in a bad light.
    <br>But the truth that brought Joseph out of pain
    <br>was the realisation that his success was on the other side of shame and scorn;
    <br>his future was on the other side of fear and failure.
    <br>Joseph rightly discovered that a man without a situation is a man without future,
    <br>where the position of influence must begin with suffering.
    <br>Let me say that again for those of us who didn't like what we heard.
    <br>The position of influence must begin with suffering.
    <br>Ask Daniel about the teeth of the lions.
    <br>Who are those waiting to devour you?
    <br>Ask Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego about the flames and the heat.
    <br>What hell were you pushed into?
    <br>What attack are you facing?
    <br>Is your life free from attack?
    <br>Then your future is doubtful, worrisome.
    <br>For the Bible says that the road to a successful future is not a bed of roses.
    <br>There will be trials, temptations and tribulations.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because you are on God's agenda
    <br>and many things that look like an abortion of God's plan for you
    <br>often end up being the road to its fulfilment.
    <br>What did Jesus say in Matthew 7?
    <br>He said, "Enter by the narrow gate for wide is the gate
    <br>and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it.
    <br>But small is the gate and narrow is the road that leads to eternal life and only a few find it."
    <br>This is the sign that you are on the right road;
    <br>this is the sign there is a successful future for you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your success is on the other side of shame and scorn."
    <br>Look at your life.
    <br>The circumstances of your birth were enough to prevent you from coming into this world.
    <br>You were once a tiny embryo but you survived.
    <br>Look how great you have become today.
    <br>Satan wanted to destroy God's creation,
    <br>but because he could not, he is now trying to destroy your perception of that creation,
    <br>your perception of yourself, of who God is and who God created you to be.
    <br>This is where the counterfeit comes in.
    <br>Many found themselves on the streets because they were given birth to in difficulty,
    <br>in abject poverty, in pain.
    <br>These are the arguments satan uses to make people question the challenges in their families,
    <br>in their relationships, in their lives.
    <br>The pain that comes as a result of unfavourable situations soon produces bitterness,
    <br>hatred, anxiety and desperation.
    <br>Satan then uses that pain to change perceptions:
    <br>Mothers look at their children and see only their attacker, their lost dreams, their frustrations.
    <br>Hearts close, love is lost and another child is rejected.
    <br>There was a deliverance that took place in The SCOAN,
    <br>you may remember it from Emmanuel TV.
    <br>A young woman came to the service
    <br>and during the course of the prayer, an evil spirit began to violently manifest from within.
    <br>It said it was lucifer.
    <br>It said it had destroyed her life and her family completely.
    <br>When asked how it entered, it said it had happened the day she was born,
    <br>when her father looked at her for the first time in the hospital room
    <br>and realised she was not a male child.
    <br>That ugly spirit entered as her father spoke these words to her, "I reject you."
    <br>With so many negative situations and disappointments around us,
    <br>it would be easy to believe that a change in our family would change our lives,
    <br>a change in our spouse would increase our joy
    <br>and a change of environment would change our situation.
    <br>Yet we would soon discover that we were left with shadows, not with substance,
    <br>and the cycle of life just continues, with no real change.
    <br>This is the case of Joseph's brothers.
    <br>They tried to sell him off as a counterfeit, a slave, someone they said had no value or worth,
    <br>believing that their position in the family would rise and their fortunes would increase.
    <br>But rather than rise, their positions fell,
    <br>as their father's whole attention was then given to Joseph.
    <br>In Genesis 37:35 the Bible says that all of Jacob's sons and daughters
    <br>came to comfort him but he refused.
    <br>He said, "No." This father of 12 sons said,
    <br>"I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave."
    <br>Their fortunes also fell, as they were almost wiped out by a famine.
    <br>In Genesis 42 Jacob tells his sons, "I hear there is grain in Egypt.
    <br>Go down and buy some for us so that we may live and not die."
    <br>They came to the brink of extinction.
    <br>It is time now for us to ask ourselves questions.
    <br>No: "When will I get a promotion?"
    <br>No, not: "When will I drive a new car?"
    <br>No, not: "Where is the new house I will one day move in to?" - no.
    <br>Where are the children we have rejected?
    <br>Look around society today - you will find them there.
    <br>They are the young people moving from one bad habit to the next.
    <br>They are the drug addicts moving from one rehab to another.
    <br>They are the prostitutes seeking an embrace from anyone willing to pay.
    <br>They are the criminals locked in the cell.
    <br>The child you rejected because of your past, because of their behaviour,
    <br>because of conflict has become a thief, a terrorist, a criminal.
    <br>Are we better off now that they are worse?
    <br>Have we risen since their fall?
    <br>One thing we must know, you who say there was a conflict: Conflict is a trap of detraction.
    <br>Satan uses conflict to break our focus on our assignment.
    <br>What is our assignment?
    <br>There is a popular adage that says, "A mother cannot forget the child on her back."
    <br>Have you forgotten your child?
    <br>This is what satan wants to achieve in your life.
    <br>You say, "They are out of control. They don't listen to me.
    <br>They are disturbing my peace. They are too far gone."
    <br>But the Bible says, "Don't reject anyone on account of today; tomorrow is a mystery."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't reject anyone on account of today; tomorrow is a mystery."
    <br>Rejecting them is rejecting their strength.
    <br>To abandon them is to abandon their strength.
    <br>Don't wait for them to come to their senses.
    <br>Find them and bring them back to the fold.
    <br>Your effort will bring them back to their senses.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your effort will bring them back to their senses."
    <br>As we think on these things, I would like to borrow someone's phone.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Now, this is the phone of today.
    <br>They say a man named Bell invented the telephone.
    <br>Ever since, we keep recreating different versions of that phone.
    <br>This is one of them.
    <br>You can see the lights in the ceiling.
    <br>They say a man named Edison invented the light bulb.
    <br>Ever since, we keep recreating different versions of that bulb.
    <br>These are some of them.
    <br>How many of us took a flight to join us today?
    <br>They say the Wright brothers got one of the first planes off the ground.
    <br>Ever since, we keep recreating different versions of that plane.
    <br>You flew on one of them.
    <br>But where are the new ideas?
    <br>Where are the new inventions?
    <br>We keep running out of ideas and the cycle of life just continues in this world and there is no change.
    <br>Why?
    <br>There is an undiscovered destiny on the inside, covered by a counterfeit.
    <br>Mothers, fathers, look for your children and bring them back.
    <br>The thorn in your flesh today may be your saviour, I mean your breadwinner, tomorrow.
    <br>Unintended, unwelcome children always become breadwinners.
    <br>Those who once disturbed your peace may be the very ones to lay you to rest.
    <br>For those of you who say you have no children or you have already lost your child, realise this:
    <br>When people ask, "Why does nothing good ever happen to me?",
    <br>maybe you are the good that needs to happen to someone else.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Why does nothing good ever happen to me?"
    <br>Now answer your neighbour,
    <br>"Maybe you are the good that needs to happen to someone else."
    <br>There are many motherless children out there - orphaned, abandoned, rejected.
    <br>They are motherless so that you can be their mother;
    <br>they are fatherless so that you can be their father.
    <br>Find them and bring them back for a comeback - a return to a point of significance.
    <br>Bring them back for a comeback - a return to a place that was lost for a period of time.
    <br>Where are the children we have rejected?
    <br>A mother once looked at her newborn son
    <br>with his entire future before him and named him Pain.
    <br>In 1 Chronicles 4:9 it says his mother had named him Jabez, saying,
    <br>"I gave birth to him in pain."
    <br>Satan wanted to trade Jabez's true potential for a life of failure
    <br>and bring his family to view him as worthless.
    <br>Satan wanted to sell Jabez off as a counterfeit and forfeit the destiny God had for him.
    <br>But in verse 10 this unwanted child cried out to the God of Israel.
    <br>He said, "Father, bless me. Indeed You are all that I need.
    <br>Expand my horizon beyond what I see.
    <br>Put Your hand upon me and keep me from evil," and God granted his request.
    <br>Contempt can humiliate one; rejection, false accusation, hatred can humiliate one.
    <br>But Jabez realised his success was on the other side of that contempt.
    <br>To the people of the world, rejection and contempt are a poison that kills man's zeal to move forward
    <br>but to the child of God, they are a driving force to a higher aspiration.
    <br>As verse 10 earlier says, Jabez was more honourable than all his brothers;
    <br>he became best among equals.
    <br>To the unintended, unwelcome child, gold is never valued until it is tested.
    <br>So walk through the furnace; spend the night in the den.
    <br>Human character is tested by the fire of rejection just as gold is tested by fire.
    <br>You are gold.
    <br>Don't let anybody's treatment of you change your perception of you,
    <br>of the God who created you and the purpose you were created for.
    <br>Rise up and let the world know who you are.
    <br>Unintended child, let other children have hope
    <br>as Jesus Himself gave us hope in the Book of Luke 22,
    <br>when He said, "Simon, Simon, satan has desired to have you
    <br>but I have prayed for you that your faith will not fail.
    <br>And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
    <br>Whatever your beginning, remember the beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>I pray that you may finish in faith, in Jesus' name.

    <br>May God bless His Words to our hearts today, in Jesus' name.
