  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, I want to assure you that Jesus is as close to you as He was to Lazarus.
    <br>You all know what happened to the dead man; you know what happened to blind Bartimaeus.
    <br>Jesus is as close to you as He was to blind Bartimaeus.
    <br>It is time now for you to take from God the faith He has prepared to give you.
    <br>I believe; help my unbelief!
    <br>When the father of the demon-possessed boy came to Him, this was his voice -
    <br>he said he believed but his belief could not receive,
    <br>that shows that his belief was equal to unbelief.
    <br>Viewers, say after me, "I believe; help my unbelief!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>I believe; help my unbelief!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen:
    <br>I believe; help my unbelief!
    <br>Viewers all over the world:
    <br>I believe; help my unbelief!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I will talk to you as I am hearing from Heaven.
    <br>I will not stand here and begin to say a word of mine. It is not mine - what I am about to say.
    <br>This is the voice of God, listen:
    <br>When we are disconnected from the devil, we are connected to God.
    <br>It is not possible to not be connected to either God or satan.
    <br>You cannot live in a neutral world.
    <br>Right now, you are about to be disconnected and be connected to God.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you - out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>How can satan connect us? You can be connected through poverty.
    <br>When poverty comes, you begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you -
    <br>satan's connection be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You know how you are connected.
    <br>You know your weakness, the area where you are not strong,
    <br>the area you complain about,
    <br>the area you talk about all the time - you are murmuring, complaining and doubting.
    <br>Whatever demons might have used to connect you to themselves, be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every chain of demon, chain of affliction, chain of disappointment,
    <br>chain of sickness and disease -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In your heart - within and out, evil thoughts -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>I am married to Jesus satan leave me alone
    <br>My Husband is coming to take me away
    <br>To everlasting home
    <br>I command healing on you!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua

    <br>I command healing on you!
    <br>Every area, every faculty, every organ that has stopped functioning, begin to function!
    <br>Begin to function!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua

    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to thank Jesus for taking you out of the affliction.
    <br>I thank You, Lord Jesus!
    <br>I thank You for taking me out of affliction, out of pain, out of hardship,
    <br>out of disappointment, out of rejection and out of hatred.
    <br>Open your lips!

    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>For you to know how mighty the anointing is.
    <br>The anointing is so mighty. Look at the fibroid.
    <br>Do you see the fibroid among you?
    <br>I am talking to the viewers all over the world but you in the church are receiving out of the viewers' blessings.
    <br>Then what do you think will happen to the viewers?
    <br>Tell me - what will happen to the viewers?
    <br>Fibroid Bursts During Viewers' Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Listen, satan, you must remove your hand.
    <br>Remove your hand from my people!
    <br>Your hand of affliction, setback, sickness, disease, rejection, nightmares - remove your hand!
    <br>Remove your hand!
    <br>I say, "Remove your hand!"
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I say, "Remove your hand in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>I say, "Remove your hand from my life - your hand of affliction, setback, sickness, and disease!"
    <br>I say, "Remove your hand!"

    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>To God be the glory! Watch the screen of your television!
    <br>As the man of God was praying just now, you can see the power of God moving in the life of the people.
    <br>You see a lady here, a fibroid just fell instantly out from her body when the man of God was praying.
    <br>Let us listen to her directly and hear what she has to say.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(Matthew 1:23 - God With Us)
    <br>My name is Mrs Chidinma Christian Gilbert.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was severe fibroids.
    <br>I had this problem for a very long time; I would have pain all over my body.
    <br>Immediately as the man of God was praying to the viewers all over the world,
    <br>I just found out that something burst out.
    <br>This is the first time I am seeing blood coming out of me like this.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I am free!
    <br>Can you press your stomach now? You said you could not press it before. How do you feel right now?
    <br>I feel very light. I am okay now; there is no more pain.
    <br>What happened is that the passage has been opened.
    <br>Any moment from now, she will feel pressed and go to the toilet.
    <br>The whole thing (will come out).
    <br>Right now, she will be having stomach pain.
    <br>But any moment she goes to the toilet, everything will be flushed out.
    <br>To God be the glory. While the prayer for the viewers was going on,
    <br>many people started vormiting different substances out of their system.
    <br>You saw the woman whose fibroid burst open and she started bleeding instantly.
    <br>Here is a woman who vomited a mixture of blood and other substances.
    <br>We just want to take one more to listen to and afterwards, we shall proceed.
    <br>Madam, tell us your name and the problem that brought you to The SCOAN.
    <br>My name is Ngozi Emmanuel Akeh.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a gunshot in the dream.
    <br>After the gunshot, I started having pain in my chest, my back, and all over my body like a moving object.
    <br>While the man of God was praying, I had the urge to vomit
    <br>because my stomach was turning and I vomited all these substances -
    <br>a mixture of blood and other substances.
    <br>Now, I am free. Thank You, Jesus! I am healed; I am delivered! No more pain in my stomach!
    <br>Now after the vomiting, how do you feel?
    <br>No more chest pain. I was even testing it before but i am okay; I cannot feel the pain anymore.
    <br>I was having pain from my chest, hands, legs, and nails - right now, I am okay!
    <br>I feel the pain no more!
    <br>Amen! Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
