    <br>Fear Not | Words Of Wisdom With TB Joshua
    <br>THOSE THAT ARE WITH US
    <br>ARE MORE THAN THOSE AGAINST US
    <br>FEAR NOT
    <br>FEAR CHANGES OUR FOCUS
    <br>FEAR WEAKENS OUR DETERMINATION AND WILL POWER.
    <br>FEAR IS A MORE DECEPTIVE ENEMY THAN SATAN HIMSELF.
    <br>FEAR NOT – THOSE WHO ARE WITH US, FIGHTING FOR US, PROTECTING US,
    <br>ARE MORE THAN THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST US TO DESTROY US.
    <br>THE ANGELS UNSPEAKABLY MORE NUMEROUS;
    <br>GOD INFINITELY MORE POWERFUL.
    <br>WHEN WE CANNOT SEE BEYOND OUR IMMEDIATE SITUATION, WE BEGIN TO PANIC.
    <br>WHEN WE ARE MAGNIFYING THE CAUSES OF OUR FEARS,
    <br>WE OUGHT TO POSSESS OURSELVES WITH CLEAR, GREAT AND HIGH
    <br>THOUGHTS OF GOD AND INVISIBLE WORLD.
    <br>IF GOD BE FOR US, WE KNOW WHAT FOLLOWS.
    <br>EVERY MOUNTAIN FOR OUR SAKE SHALL BE LEVELLED.
    <br>[AMEN!]
    <br>THE HILL WILL BECOME PLAIN.
    <br>[AMEN!]
    <br>WHEN WE WALK THROUGH FIRE, WE WILL NOT BE BURNT.
    <br>[AMEN!]
    <br>IF GOD BE FOR ME, EVERY MOUNTAIN SHALL BE LEVELLED.
    <br>THE HILL WILL BECOME PLAIN.
    <br>IF I PASS THROUGH FIRE, I WILL NOT BE BURNT.
    <br>DON'T BECAUSE OF YOUR TROUBLE CHANGE YOUR DIRECTION,
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING.
    <br>DON'T BECAUSE OF YOUR TROUBLE CHANGE YOUR DIRECTION,
    <br>DON'T BECAUSE OF YOUR TROUBLE CHANGE YOUR CONFESSION.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING.
    <br>IN EVERY SITUATION GOD HAS SOMETHING TO SAY.
    <br>TELL YOUR NEIGHBOUR, "GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING".
    <br>[GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING.]
    <br>I WILL NOT BECAUSE OF MY SITUATION
    <br>CHANGE MY DIRECTION,
    <br>CHANGE MY CONFESSION.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING.
    <br>I WILL NOT BECAUSE OF YOU CHANGE MY POSITION, CHANGE MY DIRECTION.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING THROUGH YOU.
    <br>IT MAY BE TO STOP ME AWHILE.
    <br>WHAT CAN GOD SAY THROUGH YOUR SITUATION?
    <br>IT MAY BE TO STOP YOU AWHILE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE YOU.
    <br>IT MAY BE TO STOP YOU AWHILE IN ORDER TO CHECK YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TOO FAR.
    <br>IT MAY BE TO STOP YOU AWHILE IN ORDER TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE CHALLENGES AHEAD.
    <br>IT MAY BE TO STOP YOU AWHILE IN ORDER TO KEEP YOU FOR A NEW LEVEL.
    <br>IT MAY BE TO STOP YOU AWHILE IN ORDER TO REFORM YOU.
    <br>Fear Not | Words Of Wisdom With TB Joshua
    <br>TELL YOUR NEIGHBOUR, "I'M WALKING WITH THE LORD.
    <br>I'M NOT USED TO FAILURE,
    <br>I'M NOT USED TO DOUBT.
    <br>I'M WALKING WITH THE LORD.
    <br>Fear Not | Words Of Wisdom With TB Joshua
    <br>I'M WALKING WITH THE LORD.
    <br>THEREFORE, I'M NOT WALKING BY SIGHT.
    <br>I'M WALKING WITH THE LORD.
    <br>WHAT IS SEEN CANNOT DICTATE MY DIRECTION.
    <br>I'M WALKING WITH THE LORD.
    <br>WHAT IS SEEN CANNOT CHANGE MY CONFESSION.
    <br>I'M WALKING WITH THE LORD.
