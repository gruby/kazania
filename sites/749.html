  <p>    
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>You have a serious addiction.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>With this internet.
    <br>It has become an addiction to you.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>And there is one that even sent a naked picture.
    <br>Yes, Prophet, it is true.
    <br>And your naked picture is there with him.
    <br>Yes, Prophet, it is true.
    <br>You are a beautiful girl, why should you go into that?
    <br>Now, you don't have affection again.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>If you know today is the day of your 
    <br>deliverance, shout "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Emmanuel!!
    <br>My name is Erica Jimmy and I come from Tanzania.
    <br>And my testimony goes like this:
    <br>Last week Sunday, I received a prophecy from 
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>First he said that I'm addicted to the internet.
    <br>Then the second one, he said that someone sent a naked picture to me
    <br>and I too, I sent a naked picture to him.
    <br>Then the last one, he said I don't have affection for anyone
    <br>and I confirm the prophecy to be 100% true.
    <br>It all started when I was 15 years old.
    <br>I started watching pornography.
    <br>I used to watch pornography just like a normal issue
    <br>just like I'm watching movies -
    <br>just as a normal issue, as a normal life.
    <br>I used to see it as a normal life.
    <br>I didn't know that it was something that was be bad;
    <br>it was like a normal life.
    <br>This issue of pornography later caused bad results.
    <br>After watching pornography, I would find myself masturbating.
    <br>After masturbating I would feel like, "Why have I done this, why should I do this?"
    <br>But I couldn't stop, I couldn't stop there.
    <br>I started developing this issue of chatting on the internet and Facebooking a lot.
    <br>I could Facebook until the morning - sometimes to 3:00 am or 4:00 am.
    <br>Can you explain to us how this addiction of pornography and chatting on the internet
    <br>has affected your life - your academics, your social life?
    <br>It affected me so much, so much
    <br>to the extent that I suffered serious disappointment.
    <br>I suffered rejection, isolation and even depression.
    <br>It came even a time that I used to smoke;
    <br>I used to drink hard alcohol.
    <br>I used to get irritated a lot.
    <br>So easily, just little things and I could be irritated.
    <br>I could be so irritated that I could not control myself.
    <br>Then my prayer life just went off.
    <br>I couldn't pray anymore, I couldn't read the Bible anymore.
    <br>I was just living like someone who was living but I couldn't do anything.
    <br>The issue of pornography led me to have bad dreams.
    <br>There are times I used to see mermaids;
    <br>she would come wearing this black thing at the bottom and red beads around her neck.
    <br>She would tell me that until I bowed down to worship them,
    <br>I would never have peace of mind and they would make sure I would die.
    <br>It came about that I met this man last year, in my country Tanzania.
    <br>We engaged in a relationship.
    <br>Then he travelled to Europe.
    <br>We were chatting and then came a time he asked me to send him my naked picture
    <br>but I refused at first and then he sent his own.
    <br>He said, "I did it for you, so you have to do it for me".
    <br>Then I did it for him.
    <br>When this man sent me his naked picture, he asked me to send him my naked pictures -
    <br>of maybe my breast or private part.
    <br>Then he would come with these strong, romantic words like,
    <br>'Baby, you know I am 'horny'. Could you touch this part, could you do this?'
    <br>So at the end I would find myself masturbating.
    <br>So these were the trauma you were going through
    <br>and after all these issues you were talking about, can you tell us
    <br>what were the issues, the problems that you usually encountered daily as you did all this?
    <br>Disappointment, rejection, isolation, depression
    <br>and I used to isolate myself; sometimes I didn't want to stay close to people.
    <br>Sometimes, I didn't even want to stay close to my family.
    <br>I would just isolate myself, somewhere far.
    <br>What you are talking about now, did you at any point in time share this with your family members?
    <br>No, it's a shameful thing I couldn't share 
    <br>with anyone - even a close friend.
    <br>Even someone I could share my bed with -  I could not tell anyone; I kept it all to myself.
    <br>So most of the things you are sharing with us today, your parents are hearing it for the first time?
    <br>I believe they are shaking right now wherever they are,
    <br>I know they are watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Yes, we know your parents will be very happy because today, you are delivered from all this.
    <br>Tell us, at one point in time, in your life you were experiencing bad dreams.
    <br>Can you tell us how those bad dreams also affected you in the physical?
    <br>It affected me so much, at a time I dreamt that I was in a hospital bed,
    <br>lying down there helpless, with no one to help me.
    <br>Then when I turned to the other side of the bed, I saw a lion -
    <br>a very big one with a long tail and a human head.
    <br>Then he said to me, "Erica, this time around we will catch you;
    <br>you will never go ahead of us!"
    <br>So after I woke up, I told my mum about that dream.
    <br>Then my mum introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Along the line, later we had this journey with my brother.
    <br>My brother prayed on his own in his room; he anointed the car and himself with the Morning Water.
    <br>You mean you were travelling together with your brother?
    <br>Yes, I was travelling together with my brother.
    <br>So he anointed the car, he anointed himself before we travelled.
    <br>But I couldn't pray; I just woke up, entered the car and we just went.
    <br>Along the line, I fell asleep.
    <br>Then a voice came to me, "Erica, wake up and pray".
    <br>I woke up and asked my brother, "Were you talking to me?"
    <br>He said, "No, I was not talking to you".
    <br>Then I fell asleep again.
    <br>The voice came again, very humble, "Erica, wake up and pray".
    <br>But still I could not pray although I did wake up.
    <br>I could not pray; I was just amazed wondering
    <br> if it was a voice or I was just dreaming.
    <br>Then the voice came the third time, 
    <br>"Erica, wake up and pray!"
    <br>Now, it was very strong - 'Wake up and pray!'
    <br>But still, I woke up but could not pray.
    <br>And I then saw that the car was already in the bush!
    <br>So that is the only thing I can remember,
    <br> I could not remember anything else.
    <br>So this one is a result of that accident.
    <br>So you mean you managed to survive the accident by the grace of God
    <br>through the medium of the Morning Water,
    <br>which your brother had administered before you traveled?
    <br>Yes, it's only by the grace of God that today I'm alive, so I just have to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>And finally you came to The SCOAN?
    <br>Yes, I finally came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations to seek help.
    <br>I came for this issue of disappointment and limitation in progress.
    <br>I never knew that when the man of God said, "Come!" -
    <br>I never had this in my mind that he would tell me something like this.
    <br>I never knew that I was the one, that I was the cause of my problem.
    <br>I never knew that; I was maybe thinking he would say I had a generational curse
    <br>or there was something that happened somewhere
    <br>which was the cause of what I was going through.
    <br>But I never knew he would say something like this -
    <br>addiction to the internet because I never told anyone.
    <br>That was between me and God because 
    <br>I had tried to fast and pray.
    <br>Then I decided to leave it for God, that one day I would be delivered.
    <br>And finally what happened after the man of God gave you the word of prophecy?
    <br>It's the grace of God that last week, the man of God located me; I was sitting right there.
    <br>Then the man of God was giving prophecies to the people.
    <br>Then he said that he will just prophesy for few people
    <br>But I was among those few people.
    <br>Then he spoke to me, just the way you watched.
    <br>And he prayed for me.
    <br>When he prayed for me, it was like something just left me.
    <br>I felt so light, my mind became so free,
    <br>my heart became so free,
    <br>then I realized that I didn't have that addiction anymore -
    <br>chatting, thinking of pornography, masturbating.
    <br>You mean you are completely free?
    <br>I'm completely free!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>You mentioned about several things that you were once addicted to.
    <br>You talked about depression that led to your smoking and drinking alcohol
    <br>and you talked about a lot of things you were into.
    <br>Can you explain to us, after your deliverance,
    <br>what are the things that you are no longer doing?
    <br>The first thing I noticed after my deliverance
    <br>was that I was so addicted to my phone, I could chat.
    <br>I found out that I didn't want to touch my phone so many times.
    <br>Even my sisters and my brother sent me messages
    <br>and it was just yesterday that I replied, just one text
    <br>saying I am fine where I am.
    <br>So, does it mean you are no longer having depression, no longer feeling sad?
    <br>Yes, I don't have that depression anymore,
    <br>I don't have that urge to watch pornography,
    <br>I don't have that urge to masturbate, I'm free.
    <br>From smoking and drinking?
    <br>Yes, from smoking and from drinking also.
    <br>Hallelujah. Shall we put our hands together once again for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>Yes, you mentioned that the moment the man of God gave you the prophecy,
    <br>you realized the root cause of your problem.
    <br>You identified your problem from that very moment you received your deliverance.
    <br>Can you give a word of advice to those youth like you who have similar issues
    <br>that God Almighty has just delivered you from.
    <br>Can you give them a word of advice?
    <br>To the youth , I'm starting with the youth.
    <br>I will speak in both Swahili and English.
    <br>I am starting with English.
    <br>To the youth, you need to discover yourself,
    <br>you need to discover your weakness before pointing a finger at something.
    <br>You need to discover something you are addicted to.
    <br>Don't point a finger at anyone as the cause of it.
    <br>You need to discover yourself, you need to discover your weakness.
    <br>Then you need to seek God for deliverance.
    <br>And you said you want to advice in Swahili.
    <br>Now I will speak in Swahili.
    <br>vijana wenzangu, popote mlipo najua mnanitazama sasa hivi (my fellow youth, wherever you are, I know you are watching me)
    <br>popote mlipo usione aibu kwa udhaifu uliyo nayo
    <br>(wherever you are, don't be ashamed for your weakness)
    <br>Mungu analeta nguvu katika madhaifu yetu.
    <br> (God gives strength in our weaknesses )
    <br>Usione aibu kuleta madhaifu yako mbele za mungu
    <br>(Do not be ashamed to bring your weakness before God's strength)
    <br>atakusaidia, atakuokoa na utakua huru
    <br> (He will help you, He will save you and you will be free)
    <br>kwenye matatizo yako yote 
    <br>(from all your difficulties)
    <br>We thank God. Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>Just as the man of God said that when you identify your weakness,
    <br>it's victory itself, a half job done already.
    <br>Because at that point in time, Jesus will come to bring us into a balance
    <br>and that is what just happened to your life.
    <br>The moment you discovered and acknowledged your weakness,
    <br>you realized that the problem is not a generational curse,
    <br>you are the root cause, the architect of your problem.
    <br>At that same time, Jesus Christ used the man of God to deliver you from the spirit of pornography
    <br>and addiction and today you can stand in the midst of the children of God
    <br>to say, "Thank You, Jesus" for what He has done in your life.
    <br>And we believe that the Lord who has done this in your life
    <br>is going to do it also for everyone who is 
    <br>facing the same challenges
    <br>that you have just been delivered from, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Now, can you advise the parents.
    <br>Parents out there, 
    <br>parents here in the auditorium.
    <br>Watch your children and the company they keep.
    <br>You may raise your children in a good manner.
    <br>You may raise your children in Christendom.
    <br>But watch out - once they are 
    <br>outside, the company they keep.
    <br>That's what I can advise.
    <br>We thank God for the advice you have given
    <br>and we believe that everyone who is listening to you is taking your advice to heart
    <br>because experience is the best teacher and you have just come out of this unpleasant situation.
    <br>The advice you are giving them is that everyone should pray for his children and watch over them
    <br>and be careful of the kind of friends that their children keep,
    <br>they must be careful about those friends because like the man of God said
    <br>that the only person that can take us out of the will of God is ourselves.
    <br>Therefore it implies that we must choose our friends with care
    <br>so that we may not become whom they are.
    <br>Thank you very much, sister, for this wonderful advice
    <br>that you have given to viewers all over the world, those who are watching you at this time.
    <br>We thank God for your life and we want to advice you that now that God Almighty has restored you,
    <br>you must realize and remember that you are delivered for the glory of God.
    <br>You must continue to make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>Sorry, before you go, can you explain the pictures that we have on the board.
    <br>The pictures you have there, can you explain to us?
    <br>These pictures - the one you see here was taken on the day of the accident.
    <br>The car somersaulted like 10 times before it landed.
    <br>And here it was me 21 days after the accident,
    <br>they were removing the stitches and I still have this.
    <br>So this is the scar that you sustained from the accident?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But today, everyone is alive by the grace of God after you ministered the Morning Water?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We thank God for your life and we know that
    <br>this was also a result of the life that you are coming from.
    <br>You are indeed coming from unrighteousness and today Christ Jesus has put an end to your past
    <br>and given birth to your new future.
    <br>Don't forget that as you go, continue to honour Christ and receive instructions from Him.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty in His infinite mercy will grant you the wonderful grace
    <br>to maintain your deliverance, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for the Living God!
