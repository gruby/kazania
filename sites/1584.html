    <br>HOW TO TRUST GOD IN YOUR TRIALS!!!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>You know, while you are here dancing, rejoicing,
    <br>our colleagues are outside there.
    <br>How do you feel?
    <br>But your dance doesn't show that you feel somehow.
    <br>You dance as if everybody is alright.
    <br>So, viewers all over the world:
    <br>The Bible - this is our standard for life.
    <br>When you go through it -
    <br>and I know many of you might have been reading this Bible hundreds, thousands of times,
    <br>not just reading -
    <br>you will find that eternal life, the salvation of your soul,
    <br>healing, deliverance, breakthrough,
    <br>all of God's blessings you are waiting for here do not come by doing but by believing.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>That you have come from the end of east, south, west pole, just name it - from all over the world,
    <br>or you are coming from under the ground or on the air,
    <br>or you own a debt to be here; you borrowed money,
    <br>you have been abused, beaten up, robbed on the street while you were coming...
    <br>Whatever happened to you should not be the reason you receive eternal life
    <br>but by believing in God's Son, Jesus Christ.
    <br>HOW TO TRUST GOD IN YOUR TRIALS!!!
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>Let me just take you to the very short...
    <br>The Book of John 6:47.
    <br>"Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life."
    <br>The moment you trust in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour,
    <br>as the One who gives eternal life freely, eternal life is yours as He has promised.
    <br>HOW TO TRUST GOD IN YOUR TRIALS!!!
    <br>He has promised
    <br>He will never fail
    <br>I will follow Him
    <br>He has promised
    <br>He will never fail
    <br>His faithfulness is for evermore
    <br>The moment you trust in Jesus Christ as the One who gives eternal life,
    <br>eternal life is yours as He promised.
    <br>Not the work of righteousness which you have done...
    <br>When I was coming, I saw a woman saying, "They snatched my pocket, visa, this, that..."
    <br>Now, if you have the opportunity to enter, you say,
    <br>"Because they snatched my visa, passport, money, I must receive" - no!
    <br>HOW TO TRUST GOD IN YOUR TRIALS!!!
    <br>We must trust in God in our trials.
    <br>HOW TO TRUST GOD IN YOUR TRIALS!!!
    <br>When you trust in God in your trial, that will move you beyond the present into the future.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot have challenges.
    <br>They can snatch your passport while you are a Christian.
    <br>You can be sick while you are a Christian.
    <br>Just name any foolish thing.
    <br>You can be tempted while you are a Christian
    <br>but we should not allow our challenges to misguide us, to mislead us
    <br>and begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>"I'm a Christian; why is all this happening to me? Why am I sick? Why this, that?"
    <br>Jesus can use any foolish thing to stop you awhile to prepare you for the journey.
    <br>You are being prepared for the journey.
    <br>Let me just come to the end of this message.
    <br>As you are going to the altar, make sure you are not going there by yourself.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>As you are going to the altar, make sure you are not going there by yourself.
    <br>Let us let go of an unforgiving spirit, pain of the past.
    <br>If you are going there with pain of the past, you are going there by yourself.
    <br>If you are going there with an unforgiving spirit, you are going there by yourself.
    <br>If you are going there with bad feelings towards others -
    <br>you have someone who has cheated you, did this, that,
    <br>and you are still holding that offence against the person -
    <br>whether the person is right or wrong, you have no right to hold offence.
    <br>If you are holding offence and you are going there, you are going there by yourself
    <br>and you will receive ordinary tap water, not the anointed one.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>You have to prepare now to let go of an unforgiving spirit,
    <br>bad feelings towards others, pain of the past.
    <br>Let it go!
    <br>You have time to do that now.
    <br>If you are going there holding grudges, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others,
    <br>you will just get there and the Cherubim, the Heavenly beings - they are there now...
    <br>You will just go there and they will be dodging.
    <br>They will not allow you to touch because touching them is touching healing, deliverance, salvation.
    <br>They will try to avoid you and you will go and come back the same way you go.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>Blessed is the man God disciplines.
    <br>Are you reconciling your account now?
    <br>That woman you called your enemy - I don't what she must have done to you,
    <br>please, you have to let go.
    <br>That man you put in jail, sent him to prison for many years -
    <br>when you leave here, go back to your lawyer, let the lawyer counsel you,
    <br>how you can retract that judgement,
    <br>and find time to visit him in the prison and say,
    <br>"Please, I'm working out how you can leave this place. I'm sorry.
    <br>I know you have offended me but as a Christian..."
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>As a Christian, you have no right.
    <br>Consult your lawyer for counsel, "This man is in prison because he has stolen my property,
    <br>because he killed my loved one. Lawyer, please counsel me, tell me how to go about it.
    <br>I want to pay a visit there so that I can prepare a way out, to bail him, to remove him..."
    <br>You too, you are in prison.
    <br>It is not only those who are in the prison that are in prison, but in person.
    <br>Many of us are in prison.
    <br>Our business is in prison.
    <br>Our health is in prison.
    <br>Our career is in prison.
    <br>Our spiritual life is in prison.
    <br>What is the difference?
    <br>Your imprisonment is worse than of those who are in prison.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>My heart goes for people out there.
    <br>I want to leave this message.
    <br>I will not go there because the people there...
    <br>Me too, I'm a person just like you.
    <br>I will take my cup and I will queue, follow you to get my own
    <br>because I need this more than you.
    <br>I will queue because you people are disturbing me so much.
    <br>Throughout the night, I could not sleep.
    <br>When I'm sleeping, you will say, "I'm coming for Living Water; you have to wake up".
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>It is not you but you have two natures.
    <br>There is one nature you cannot control - it is roaming about everywhere.
    <br>"T.B. Joshua - you are sleeping. If I come and I'm not delivered..."
    <br>If I get this and I roll on this altar today - come again, you will see what will happen.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>Right now, they have arrived - please, can you welcome them?
    <br>Please welcome them.
    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit
    <br>We welcome You today
    <br>Fill us with Your presence
    <br>As we give You the praise
    <br>Lord we are Your temple
    <br>For You alone we wait
    <br>Holy Spirit
    <br>Welcome in this place
    <br>Holy Spirit
    <br>Come and take Your place
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit
    <br>We welcome You today
    <br>Fill us with Your presence
    <br>As we give You the praise
    <br>Lord we are Your temple
    <br>For You alone we wait
    <br>Holy Spirit
    <br>Welcome in this place
    <br>Holy Spirit
    <br>Come and take Your place
    <br>Something has happened in our midst even before coming; for you to know where you are going.
    <br>They have started.
    <br>Usher, move around.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Before going to the altar, you will begin to see.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>You see me leaving that place because I also cannot stand the heat any longer - I have to leave.
    <br>See what is happening in the midst of the people.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me, Your favour speak for me.
    <br>If you mean what you are saying...
    <br>What you are saying now - if you mean it, it will be your breakthrough!
    <br>I mean, it will be your deliverance!
    <br>You mean it?
    <br>Have mercy on me.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me, Your favour speak for me.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>It can be your deliverance.
    <br>- I mean your deliverance!
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>- Your breakthrough!
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
