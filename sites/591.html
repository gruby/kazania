  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Good morning, church!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Viewers all over the world and those who are under the influence of my voice,
    <br>whatever medium you are using to watch us,
    <br>we are with you and you are with us by faith.
    <br>Happy New Year! - let me greet you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This New Year, we shall talk about how we can equip ourselves and prepare for whatever challenges.
    <br>It's your year, no doubt about that.
    <br>It will come with strange and uncommon challenges but notwithstanding, it's your year!
    <br>If you go by the Year of Reward, God is your Rewarder; He's mine.
    <br>If God is your Rewarder, it's your year.
    <br>Say, "No matter the challenges, it's my year. God is my Rewarder."
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Open with me the book of Matthew 5.
    <br>I will take my reading from verse 1, that is Matthew 5.
    <br>"Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,
    <br>and he began to teach them."
    <br>He began to teach them what?
    <br>Let's go to the proof text.
    <br>Matthew 5:44, " But I tell you, love your enemies..."
    <br>I say hmm, because it has been an issue.
    <br>It's not that you don’t love – you love
    <br>but the kind of love you have is a love with expectation.
    <br>You have been loving and kind but love with what?
    <br>Expectation.
    <br>Jesus tells His disciples, "... love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you..."
    <br>You know what it means to love those who persecute you.
    <br>"… that you may be children of your Father in heaven.
    <br>He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good,
    <br>and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."
    <br>That means that both the evil and good enjoy the rain.
    <br>"If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?
    <br>Are not even the tax collectors doing that?"
    <br>The tax collectors do the same.
    <br>"And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others?
    <br>Do not even pagans do that?
    <br>Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
    <br>What the Bible is talking about is love without expectation.
    <br>Love without what?
    <br>Expectation.
    <br>When we love without expectation, our love is being sown to the Spirit.
    <br>To sow love to the Spirit is to honour God in our acts of love.
    <br>In whatever you do.
    <br>Anything you do to carry God along or honour Him,
    <br>you are doing it in Spirit because God is Spirit
    <br>and we worshippers worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>I mean, in total humility and submission to His will.
    <br>I take you back again.
    <br>Because you are very very loving but with expectation.
    <br>You hardly love people without expectation.
    <br>You hardly give kiss to ugly person.
    <br>You prefer to give kiss to a beautiful and handsome person.
    <br>That is your expectation.
    <br>Your reward.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>This is a New Year. I want to you to grow.
    <br>Use that opportunity of that reward that is coming for you because God is our Rewarder.
    <br>Love without expectation earns us the love of our Heavenly Father.
    <br>That is what the Bible is saying in Matthew 5:44.
    <br>"Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you."
    <br>Do good to those who hate you.
    <br>You will receive blessing of your Heavenly Father.
    <br>You know, I said that you are very loving and so kind but with expectation.
    <br>Hardly will you do something without expecting something.
    <br>It's all about selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>Love without expectation earns us the love of our Heavenly Father.
    <br>"Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come."
    <br>When you sow God's love, you reap God's love.
    <br>We need to develop faith in this spiritual law.
    <br>We need to develop faith in what?
    <br>Spiritual what?
    <br>Spiritual law.
    <br>You just have to develop faith.
    <br>If your faith is in your faith, you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>That is "tit for tat".
    <br>If your faith is faith in faith, faith in yourself, it is "tit for tat".
    <br>Hit me, I hit you.
    <br>But faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
    <br>must be developed in this spiritual law.
    <br>Love without expectation says, 'Love your enemies,
    <br>bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you
    <br>and you will receive the blessing of your Heavenly Father'.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>This year, for you to receive that reward, great reward, you must love without expectation.
    <br>Expectation of certain behaviours from loved ones, relatives, acquaintances
    <br>and friends sets us up for offence.
    <br>Take for instance, I expect you to greet me because of help I rendered
    <br>or my superiority in age or my position as pastor T.B. Joshua - you are a member of the church
    <br>I'm expecting you to greet me, and you ignore me.
    <br>This is a major root of offence.
    <br>T.B. Joshua is expecting you to greet him.
    <br>You are a member of the church, and I am going,
    <br>but you just walk away from me, ignoring me.
    <br>This is a major root of offence.
    <br>It is because I expect you to greet me, because of my position, my superiority of age, or whatever.
    <br>We often get disappointed and offended when our expectations are not met.
    <br>Cut down on your expectation from people
    <br>before you set up yourself for offence.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Cut down on your expectation from people before you set up yourself for offence".
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen to me.
    <br>Cut down on your expectation from people before you set up yourself for offence.
    <br>Expectations of certain behaviours should carefully be observed.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Expectations of certain behaviours should carefully be observed".
    <br>I expect Mr A to do this and Mr B to do that.
    <br>There is nothing bad with that but that should not lead to offence.
    <br>We are often shocked, surprised and confused when offended,
    <br>as if we are the only ones wronged, as if no one else has ever been wronged.
    <br>Yet, Jesus made it clear in Luke 17:1 – it is impossible to live this life
    <br>and not have the opportunity to be offended.
    <br>In Luke 17:1, He said it is impossible to live this life and not have the opportunity to be offended.
    <br>I mean, it is impossible that no offences should come.
    <br>It is not a question of opportunity to be offended but what your response will be.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My response determines my future".
    <br>When I'm hurt, deeply hurt, bitter, my response determines my future.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>If you know that tactic and strategy of satan, you overcome satan.
    <br>When I'm hurt, deeply hurt, bitter, cheated, wrongly accused, my response determines my future.
    <br>Stand up and tell the viewers all over the world.
    <br>Stretch your hand and tell them, so that the awareness will grow.
    <br>Viewers, when you are hurt, deeply hurt, bitter, wrongly accused, persecuted,
    <br>your response determines your future.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Now, from this moment, when somebody tries you mistreat you, or accuse you wrongly -
    <br>"why pushing me?" - be careful.
    <br>Two wrongs do not make a right.
    <br>Or when you moved just a little from your place, and somebody took over your seat,
    <br>you come back to your seat, even your Bible which was there was moved by this person
    <br>who sat on your seat.
    <br>Be careful. Your response determines your future.
    <br>When you expect someone to pay your money, and you move with police, security and you want to...
    <br>Or your landlord.
    <br>A landlord today can be a tenant tomorrow and a tenant today can be a landlord tomorrow.
    <br>A pastor today can be a drunkard tomorrow and a drunkard today can be a pastor tomorrow.
    <br>You rich man – a rich man today can be a poor man tomorrow
    <br>and a poor man today can be a rich man tomorrow.
    <br>A sinner today can be a righteous man tomorrow
    <br>and a righteous man today can be a sinner tomorrow.
    <br>This is why the Bible says the beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>There is a race.
    <br>There is a race that I must run
    <br>There are victories to be won
    <br>Give me power every hour to be true
    <br>There is a race
    <br>There is a race that I must run
    <br>There are victories to be won
    <br>Give me power every hour to be true
    <br>There is a race
    <br>There is a race that I must run
    <br>There are victories to be won
    <br>Give me power every hour to be true
    <br>Oh Lord see me through
    <br>See me through
    <br>Lord Jesus see me through
    <br>See me through
    <br>Lord Jesus see me through
    <br>There is a race
    <br>There is a race that I must run
    <br>There are victories to be won
    <br>Give me power every hour to be true
    <br>The Lord will see you through!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, those of you under the influence of my voice,
    <br>the Lord will see you through.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The book of Galatians says that if one is caught in act of wrong,
    <br>you that caught the person should restore the person gently, so that you will not be tempted.
    <br>Your response when you are hurt, embarrassed, mistreated, misjudged,
    <br>wrongly accused, persecuted, hated, your response determines your future.
    <br>Jesus on the Cross, said, "Father, forgive them".
    <br>'Them' means offender and offended. "Father, forgive them".
    <br>Often, the response we exhibit leaves us vulnerable to a root of bitterness.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Often, the response we exhibit leaves us vulnerable to a root of bitterness,
    <br>anger, strife, outrage, jealousy, envy, hatred and resentment.
    <br>We must therefore be ready, prepared and strongly armed for offence
    <br>because our response determines our future.
    <br>When you get home, open the Book of Acts 24:16.
    <br>You must therefore be ready, prepared and strongly armed for offence.
    <br>You wake up in the morning and you expect your little baby to greet you,
    <br>but it ignores you.
    <br>"What is wrong with you?"
    <br>From "what is wrong with you?" to anger, from anger bitterness, from bitterness the jealousy, and so on...
    <br>You are trapped, in prison.
    <br>Offence is the effective instrument used by satan.
    <br>Offence is very common, epidemic, rampant, unavoidable,
    <br>occurs everywhere, bound to happen because the Bible says, it is impossible
    <br>to live among people and not have the opportunity to be offended.
    <br>It is bound to happen everywhere.
    <br>We have almost come to believe that it is a way of life
    <br>because it is common everywhere.
    <br>If satan wants to imprison you, he knows how to go about it – through offence.
    <br>Satan wants to embarrass you through offence.
    <br>Look at what happened to Job.
    <br>Satan came to God - this man You say is righteous, let me tempt him, let me provoke him, let me hurt him
    <br>let me cause bitterness in him.
    <br>Viewers, listen to me.
    <br>All your dreams for many years will come through this year.
    <br>Viewers, whatever medium you are using to watch us,
    <br>once you are under the influence of my voice,
    <br>your dreams for many years – come through this year!
    <br>Dream of finances, breakthrough, good health, prosperity – come through!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, I separate you from nightmares!
    <br>Be separated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When I say, 'nightmare', I mean every foolish thing.
    <br>Just think of any foolish thing – the root of satan, the root of offence.
    <br>Viewers, listen once again: By the authority in the name of Jesus,
    <br>whatever medium you are using to watch us,
    <br>so far as you are under the influence of my voice,
    <br>(come on)
    <br>I separate you from nightmares!
    <br>Be separated!
    <br>Jesus loves you. Your response determines your future.
    <br>Offence – there's nothing you can do about it.
    <br>The only thing – don’t feed on it in your heart; don’t act it.
    <br>People will offend you. Offence itself is not deadly.
    <br>As it stays in your heart, it is not deadly.
    <br>Well, it is not the easiest road to take – humility and self-denial,
    <br>like I have said.
    <br>When people embarrass you, curse you, misjudge you, persecute you,
    <br>lie against you, wrong accusation – your response is your weapon.
    <br>It's the key to loose or bind.
    <br>It's either that response locks you more or opens the future.
    <br>When satan knows you are doing well and happy, he comes with offence.
    <br>Your reaction to that offence determines your future.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your reaction to that offence determines your future".
    <br>When they know you are happy, your family and you are good, everything is alright...
    <br>When you plan to go to the church in your "posh car" and the engine knocks - you say,
    <br>"oh no, I cannot go to the church" - it means that satan has trapped you.
    <br>You say to your family, "my family, we cannot go the church because the engine knocked".
    <br>Who gave you the vehicle?
    <br>Is it a crime to bless you?
    <br>When you didn't have the vehicle, you knew how to come to the church, how to worship your God.
    <br>Now a blessing of God became what?
    <br>A burden.
    <br>A crime.
    <br>I was telling my people last week that we must not take an offence.
    <br>When you are fasting, praying, you are happy with yourself, a mosquito will just come from nowhere,
    <br>and makes sure it feeds on you, and becomes full of blood.
    <br>When you just hit you see a lot of blood on your beautiful garment.
    <br>Would you not hold offence?
    <br>"What is all this?"
    <br>From offence comes what?
    <br>Anger, outrage, strifes.
    <br>This New Year, you should carefully observe the major root of what?
    <br>Offence.
    <br>God bless you. Rise up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I will not leave you without offering this prayer; it’s a prophetic word.
    <br>Join me in prayer.
    <br>For so long you have been dreaming but your dream has not come through.
    <br>This is the year!
    <br>Open your lips, right now.
    <br>Your dreams for many years – come through this year!
    <br>Come through this year.
    <br>Dream of finances, prosperity, good health -
    <br>come through, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to separate yourself from your situation.
    <br>Separate yourself from that nightmare!
    <br>Separate yourself.
    <br>I separate myself from that nightmare!
    <br>Be separated!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, be separated!
    <br>Be separated!
    <br>Begin to separate yourself from that sickness!
    <br>Separate yourself from that setback!
    <br>Separate yourself!
    <br>Separate yourself from that fleshly desire and thought!
    <br>Fleshly desire and thought!
    <br>Separate yourself!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “when I’m hurt, deeply hurt, bitter, my response determines my future”.
    <br>Offence is the effective instrument used by satan to trap you,
    <br>to imprison you and to make you a bond-servant.
    <br>That is - he can send you an errand to kill to destroy and to make you a bond-servant.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Listen, say to yourself,
    <br>“Offence is the effective instrument used by satan to trap you,
    <br>to imprison you – I mean to make you a bond-servant”.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Your reaction to that offence gives birth to hurt, anger, jealousy, envy, outrage, strifes,
    <br>resentment – just name it.
    <br>Therefore, your response determines your future.
    <br>Whether you are wrong or right, you do not have permission or the right
    <br>to hold onto offence because two wrongs do not make a right.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “whether you are right or wrong, wrongly accused or not,
    <br>persecuted or not, you do not have the right or permission to hold onto offence
    <br>because two wrongs do not make a right”.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>Because you are persecuted, mistreated, wrongly accused, falsely accused or cheated,
    <br>you do not have a right or permission to hold onto offence because two wrongs do not make a right.
    <br>This is what Jesus meant,
    <br>“Bless those who curse you and do good to those who hate you”.
    <br>Tell your neighbour – this is what Jesus meant -
    <br>“Bless those who curse you and do good to those who hate you”.
    <br>Until you begin to live and love without expectation, your life will continue to be epileptic.
    <br>Today good, tomorrow...
    <br>Up and down, business is going well, tomorrow no...
    <br>Until you continue to love without expectation...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Love without expectation".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Love without expectation.
    <br>Care without expectation.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Care without expectation.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Care without expectation.
    <br>Love without expectation.
    <br>Care without expectation.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Love without expectation.
    <br>Care without expectation.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Love without expectation.
    <br>Care without expectation.
    <br>Whether is comes or not, I am not expecting it.
    <br>If I care for you, I am not expecting a reward because my reward is from Heaven.
    <br>You are not even the person that will reward me.
    <br>If I care for you, someone is somewhere to reward me.
    <br>Hallelujah!
