  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to say thank you for your time; God’s time is the best.
    <br>This is God’s time, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>While I listen to some of the confessions... the Bible has said it already - this child is destined
    <br>to cause the rise and falling of many; to cause the rise of many who appreciate Him,
    <br>who know Him as a Prophet,
    <br>but the falling of those who what?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God has been fighting for me right from the beginning.
    <br>This is why you will not hear anything from me.
    <br>If you slap me I will just say "OK, thank you".
    <br>I know God will fight for me.
    <br>You don't fight for God.
    <br>Leave the battle for God.
    <br>What you say about me, about the ministry...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is all about Jesus.
    <br>Since it is all about Jesus, it is not about me, my effort, my knowledge, my gifts - it is all about Jesus.
    <br>He had been fighting for me.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>It is a pity that a lot might have been deceived.
    <br>Many of us here cry when they see the healing going on.
    <br>You ask them, "Why are you crying? People are receiving healing and you are crying
    <br>instead of jumping and thanking God"
    <br>You hear from them that, "I wanted to bring my mammy here. I was deceived and this woman is late now".
    <br>You hear different stories just like that.
    <br>You just leave your battle for God but it may be very difficult.
    <br>You know - at the beginning of the ministry it was so bad - the image out there,
    <br>but we just leave the battle for God.
    <br>At the beginning, it will be very tough but as time goes on,
    <br>at the midway, you will begin to see fruit of your labour.
    <br>It’s sweet to leave your battle for God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It’s very sweet to leave your battle for God."
    <br>You just pray as if all depends on God and begin to work as if all depends on you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Pray as if all depends on God but work very hard, as if all depends on you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At the beginning it will look as if you are surrounded with dark clouds:
    <br>you will be doing good and people will be giving other name to it, saying that you are doing bad.
    <br>You smile: people say, “You are sad”.
    <br>You are happy; people say, “No, there is sorrow!”
    <br>They are very good in propaganda.
    <br>They have numerous people out there that are very good in propaganda, blackmail, name calling...
    <br>and they are trillions.
    <br>It is a professional business now to spoil peoples name.
    <br>It is a professional job going out to spoil your name, pay people money to destroy your career,
    <br>to "paint you black".
    <br>It is a professional job now.
    <br>In the past, it was not a professional job - you had to hire somebody to do this
    <br>but now it is a professional job.
    <br>Just leave the battle for God.
    <br>Thank God for the blessing God gave us – Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At the beginning, there was nothing like Emmanuel TV.
    <br>As God worked here, people would give it a different name there.
    <br>But right now, people see it live and direct.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As I am talking now, people are watching.
    <br>They just want to know if it is live.
    <br>If somebody tells you, "He said this." you can say, "No, this is what I heard."
    <br>This is the battle going on out there now.
    <br>The battle now is quite different from the battle in the past.
    <br>The battle in the past was, "He said, 'No'" - and they would take it.
    <br>But the present battle is:
    <br>- "He said 'No'"
    <br>People would answer:
    <br>- "'No', he said 'Yes'. I was there "
    <br>- "He said 'No'"
    <br>- "I was there"
    <br>It is the fight of Pharisees and Sadducees.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the argument now.
    <br>- "I was watching. I recorded it. I heard him saying 'No'"
    <br>-"'No'. He said 'Yes'"
    <br>- "No, it was 'No'" 
    <br>- "No, it was 'Yes'"
    <br>This battle is very hot, but they overcome it because it was recorded.
    <br>It is just like that.
    <br>I know how many of us here were greatly destroyed by it.
    <br>Don't give up.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't give up".
    <br>[Don't give up.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Don't give up.]
    <br>Hold on and keep fighting.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't give up; hold on and keep fighting."
    <br>That is a good fight.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say they lie against you, this is very bad...
    <br>This is what they want.
    <br>Hold on and keep fighting the good fight and that is the beauty of our journey.
    <br>When you are going and something is there to push you back – that is the beauty of the journey.
    <br>That will make you value the journey and also make you value the achievement.
    <br>By the time you go through and thing about what you have gone through,
    <br>what you have encountered – it will make you value whatever you achieve.
    <br>When you sit down and think about what you have gone through to achieve what you have achieved...
    <br>... escaped death, escaped accident, blackmail, name calling; a lot.
    <br>At the end you are there.
    <br>You will gorgeously hold that victory and cherish it so much.
    <br>There are many people who think they have victory - you see them living a reckless life; clubhouse, smoking,
    <br>drinking, going out, when they are very rich.
    <br>Doubt that achievement.
    <br>That achievement is not going through the right processing.
    <br>The right processing means "good, bad - today it is good tomorrow it is bad".
    <br>If you go through all this processing to achieve this you will gorgeously cherish the victory.
    <br>You can see many marriages today - people say they would quit the marriage, that they are tired...
    <br>You ask yourself - maybe they are together because of the outward appearance or qualities?
    <br>Probably the lady saw the handsome man, the beauty, the money, fame, popularity -
    <br>maybe that's why they came here together as husband and wife.
    <br>Anything can break such marriage.
    <br>If outward quality is base of coming here together as husband and wife - forget - they will soon what?
    <br>Tell me.
    <br>They will soon separate.
    <br>But if their coming together is a result of something beyond human comprehension - from the heart,
    <br>the love from the heart...
    <br>You have decided - nothing can break.
    <br>The Lord have brought you together - only Him that can what?
    <br>Separate you.
    <br>Not a situation, not name calling, not someone coming and saying, "Your husband is a criminal.
    <br>Don't you know? This is a picture. We caught him."
    <br>You say, "No, I'm not interested in the marriage."
    <br>Situation will never break a marriage that God brought together.
    <br>Challenges will never break a marriage that God brought together.
    <br>Trouble will never break a marriage the Lord brought together.
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>Even death...
    <br>If death comes it cannot separate that marriage.
    <br>Can't you hear what Paul said?
    <br>What can separate me from the love of God?
    <br>Every love of a Christian is love of God.
    <br>Because our love sees beyond hatred, trouble, challenges, and condition – beyond.
    <br>If trouble comes and you have the love of Christ, that love will still stand.
    <br>Trouble will not cause to say, "No, I don't love you any more because you are a criminal."
    <br>No, that is not a love of God.
    <br>Only God, the Father of love...
    <br>This is it.
    <br>This is why you keep going around.
    <br>Someone from whom you separated some years ago is your friend today.
    <br>If you knew that this man would be your saviour, you would not want to separate from him.
    <br>But because you have selfish, material, classic love for people...
    <br>Look at politics today.
    <br>Everywhere, all over the world, Africa, western world, America - all over.
    <br>We have seen a man accusing the candidate of being a criminal,
    <br>but when the candidate wins the election, the accuser is the one who wants to be the minister of external affairs.
    <br>Love of God is the answer to your problem.
    <br>Just love and see whether or not you will be healed.
    <br>Just love and see whether or not you will be delivered.
    <br>You just need love of God; is sees beyond hatred.
    <br>If I express the love of God to you,
    <br>I will never separate from you because of trouble, unless God says separate.
    <br>No matter the trouble, trouble will not make me to quit from that love.
    <br>Because if you have a trouble with me and I quit; what about tomorrow - if you are there the one to help me?
    <br>What would I do?
    <br>I would still come back to you.
    <br>This is what is happening today.
    <br>People you see as enemies today seem to be your saviours tomorrow.
    <br>People keep going back to their former friends.
    <br>Your formal political or business friends...
    <br>Even in the marriage; people who quitted the marriage - they begin to go back and re-marry.
    <br>As for me - I don't know what you are talking about.
    <br>You say somebody is bad...
    <br>Unless God says the person is bad...
    <br>God can use any foolish thing to humble anyone.
    <br>What you say - very arrogant...
    <br>You just find yourself stealing a property.
    <br>By the time you finish stealing the property you ask yourself,
    <br>"What pushed me to do this? I have a lot of money. Why should I steal?"
    <br>But something has to humble you.
    <br>It may be sickness...
    <br>When you become so arrogant, that sickness will just come.
    <br>What you didn't notice before - you will start to see.
    <br>It is to humble you.
    <br>After you are humbled the sickness is gone.
    <br>Look at what happened to many of you to humble you.
    <br>You, who used to count money, you become a beggar now.
    <br>Somebody you would never greet is your saviour now.
    <br>A lot of things had humbled you.
    <br>Many of you say that you would never come to the Synagogue but you sit in the front now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And you even ask to record your face.
    <br>When we start dancing, some people would be doing...
    <br>They want their people to see them at home, that they are here.
    <br>And those are people who used to say, "Over my dead body."
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>We keep eating what we have vomited, like a dog.
    <br>We know dog.
    <br>When dog vomits it will never eat that.
    <br>But we vomit and we eat what we vomit.
    <br>This is life.
    <br>In our business, you go to places to which you said you would never go.
    <br>A man you said you would never talk to - now he is in the position to help you - you go there.
    <br>You vomit and you eat your vomit.
    <br>This is just life - very embarrassing.
    <br>I know this right from the beginning of my life.
    <br>When you curse, abuse or lie against me - I will not talk.
    <br>I will be looking because I'm afraid that you that hate me now, you may be my saviour tomorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When people start to say, "T.B. Joshua is a devil"...
    <br>All sorts of things, you lie against me, whatever you do - I will not talk.
    <br>I will be looking at tomorrow.
    <br>Not now.
    <br>The fear I have is; if you are very bad now, you may be the best man tomorrow.
    <br>If I now begin to wrestle and fight with you beyond repair and you are there to help me tomorrow -
    <br>how will I approach you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You - you have done a lot fighting your enemy, those who fight you, trying to do all sort of things...
    <br>People insult you, you insult them.
    <br>You take them to the court, you sentence them to the prison.
    <br>Many husbands of those who are here are in the prison.
    <br>Many wives of those who are here are in the prison.
    <br>Many house mates of those who are here are imprisoned.
    <br>Many of those in here today have imprisoned their staff working with them.
    <br>If you look back at what you have done...
    <br>Many have imprisoned their saviours tomorrow.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Many have imprisoned their saviours tomorrow -
    <br>because of wrong."
    <br>Because of wrong the person has done now, they have imprisoned their saviour.
    <br>The person you imprisoned is your saviour tomorrow, and he is in the prison.
    <br>Check yourself, your staff - what they have done is bad - we agree.
    <br>They might have committed crimes; stealing, destruction in your company, but you sentenced them to death,
    <br>or prison - some even to death.
    <br>But these are the people God wants to use as the saviour for you tomorrow,
    <br>no matter how bad the person is now.
    <br>Tomorrow is something you don't understand, a mystery you don't understand.
    <br>But because you claim your right, "Oh no, this man insulted me, embarrassed me, stole my property" -
    <br>you sentence him to prison.
    <br>The same man is your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>You will miss a saviour tomorrow, but he is there.
    <br>It could be a saviour to your children tomorrow.
    <br>This is why the Bible says, “Forgive those who have trespassed against us…”
    <br>You want to say, "Father, forgive me".
    <br>Have you forgiven those who have wronged you?
    <br>You say, "Forgive us, as we forgive those who have what"?
    <br>[Wronged us.]
    <br>This is what is meant.
    <br>Father, forgive us, as we forgive those who have...
    <br>The condition is: you have to forgive them before He can forgive you.
    <br>The condition is: these people that are wrong today...
    <br>Even the Bible in the book of Galatians said it:
    <br>if you have caught someone in act of sin or mistake...
    <br>You caught somebody stealing - it says that you should restore that person gently.
    <br>To restore somebody back is to counsel the person, to talk to the person, not to judge the person.
    <br>Because if you judge, who will judge you on the last day?
    <br>If there is anything I fear most...
    <br>If they ask, "T.B. Joshua, what do you fear a lot?"
    <br>Tomorrow.
    <br>When I say tomorrow I mean "next".
    <br>While I am turning I am facing tomorrow.
    <br>This is what I mean.
    <br>I fear.
    <br>I do not fear of what I am looking at now.
    <br>I fear what I will see next.
    <br>You own now, but God owns our future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can say to God, "Please, leave me".
    <br>But "next" is there for you to judge the action you display now.
    <br>Now, if you see Jesus, you can slap Him, but "next" is there to judge you.
    <br>If there is anything I fear - it is "next".
    <br>I will not use the word "future", I will say "next".
    <br>If there is anything I fear – next.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[If there is anything I fear – next.]
    <br>I fear the "next".
    <br>OK, you - I know no fear, but next...
    <br>Because of this fear - if you hit me I will just be silent.
    <br>Because I don't know; if you are the worst now, maybe you will be there in the future for me.
    <br>I have sinned.
    <br>Look at Paul, look at Saul...
    <br>You have seen your servant in the office; later he becomes a leader.
    <br>You have seen someone coming from your village, you received him, housed him, clothed him, took care of him,
    <br>and then, before you know it, he becomes a MD of the company,
    <br>someone to whom your children run for help.
    <br>A little boy or girl who came from the village, and you were there as a father in the city - you receive him
    <br>because he is your family.
    <br>You ask him where he wants to live.
    <br>You begin to use him as your house-mate or house-boy, gardener or whatever...
    <br>Before you know it he enters school.
    <br>While the time passes, before you know it, he becomes a leader, governor, president...
    <br>Now, he is there to help you and your family.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, you begin to complain; "Go and meet him. I hosted him when he came to Lagos from the village.
    <br>I clothed him, I sent him to school. Go and meet him."
    <br>Now, you become a prayer warrior, you pray; "God, this boy - Peter, I hosted him, I received him, I clothed him,
    <br>I sent him to school. He is now a millionaire. God, I'm going to meet him now in his office. Whatever I say -
    <br>God, enter his heart."
    <br>God should enter his heart - when I speak he should listen. I need one million dollars.
    <br>He should just sign a cheque for me.
    <br>You fast before going there.
    <br>You move towards the office, you are about to enter the office...
    <br>You know, before meeting a MD or leader there is a protocol to follow.
    <br>First, the security will ask you to sit down.
    <br>While you sit you start talking to the security agent:
    <br>- "How are you?"
    <br>- "Fine"
    <br>- "It is my son. When he came from the village I was the one who...
    <br>... I was the one who hosted him in the 90s..."
    <br>And the security agent is surprised, "You hosted him?"
    <br>If you have some wonderful pictures when he was very small, you show them explaining,
    <br>"This is him, this is me."
    <br>It is true.
    <br>The agent would haste to inform others.
    <br>He informs senior security officers, "Close family member wants to see the governor".
    <br>They will inform the senior adviser to the governor - because they work by directives.
    <br>The adviser would react, "Please! What is your name? You are sacked. What family member?"
    <br>We are talking of protocol - do you imagine bringing somebody from the village?
    <br>Would this person be able to see the governor?
    <br>These are the stories.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear next.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Fear next.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Fear next.]
    <br>If you don't fear next you will finish telling stories.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you don't fear next you will end up telling stories."
    <br>If some people, they are telling stories...
    <br>Many of us here have time to tell stories of the president, the secretary general,
    <br>how you started schooling and he was junior to you, how you used to help him, how you were the first student,
    <br>how you were senior...
    <br>People would be listening.
    <br>By the time you finish they would...
    <br>I don't want to tell stories.
    <br>I fear next.
    <br>When I see a little boy coming my way, I don't want to know his background.
    <br>Whether he is rich or poor... because God is always on the side of those poor.
    <br>God is always on the side of those who have nothing.
    <br>Those little children when I see them - I am always careful.
    <br>I need to tell you people why I am always careful about the next.
    <br>Do you know that Jesus can come as a person to test your faith, to see how strong you are?
    <br>It could happen even here in the church.
    <br>He would just come and put on the rug, the kind of thing you don't expect people to wear coming to the church.
    <br>He would start His test from the security.
    <br>"Please, help me. I want to worship."
    <br>If security agents are not in the Spirit, they would say, "Please! Before I open my eyes... Find your way!"
    <br>And we are here for Jesus.
    <br>The same Jesus we are here for, is the same we are chasing out.
    <br>What next to come?
    <br>If you chase away Jesus, what next?
    <br>Many of us...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are in the posh car, driving...
    <br>Somebody would just come and said, "Please, I have not eaten since morning. Help me."
    <br>You look at the person...
    <br>You don't know that the Saviour you are calling is the one that is asking you for help.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don't know.
    <br>You will say, "How the Saviour of the world could come just like that?" No!
    <br>He has no beginning, He has no end.
    <br>After the prayer and any other thing we are here for, there is a time to test your faith.
    <br>This test will make 90% of the mark, and what is here will make only 10% of the mark.
    <br>That is why...
    <br>Whatever we receive needs to be examined by tests.
    <br>Just after leaving here it is a time to test your faith.
    <br>Time of tests starts even here.
    <br>That is the beauty.
    <br>Nothing comes for nothing; nothing comes by chance.
    <br>You should be ready for tests that will test your faith.
    <br>Do you mean what you are saying?
    <br>Do you mean what you are doing?
    <br>Do you mean what you confess?
    <br>"Lord Jesus, I am a sinner, come in to my live, enter my soul, wash me with your precious blood..."
    <br>Do you actually mean it?
    <br>A test will confirm whether you mean what you are confessing.
    <br>Look at the gentleman here; he came with walking sticks for healing.
    <br>I don't know where he is coming from.
    <br>He has passed through many churches, but he is here.
    <br>The question I used to ask myself, "Why here?"
    <br>This is to test my faith.
    <br>Not that I'm superior or better than any other person but he came to test my faith.
    <br>For my faith to be tested - I need to be very just.
    <br>To be just is to do what Christ wants us to do.
    <br>Prayer - we are given this grace to pray freely and you are to pray for him freely.
    <br>And you have to thank him, greet him, and give him a kiss.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Pray for him, ask him if he is OK, call the evangelist to take care of him.
    <br>If you need money...
    <br>Maybe he has spent all his money.
    <br>Now, he is here.
    <br>If you don't help him financially he may return to the world and whatever you have done for him is a waste.
    <br>It is somebody who had spent all his money on this sickness and is here.
    <br>And now he is cured.
    <br>Now, he needs to eat, to go home, and he becomes a beggar again.
    <br>This is another temptation.
    <br>That could lead him to loosing his miracle.
    <br>So, please - ask him if he needs transport.
    <br>Let him come again tomorrow, let us intervene.
    <br>He has to keep fighting a good fight.
    <br>We need to do whatever he needs to support him.
    <br>He should not be giving us money.
    <br>Him giving his money being sick, he is giving us his own sickness.
    <br>And I don't want sickness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If this man has money and you tell him to pay 100 000 Naira - he will give you immediately
    <br>but that money is not from his heart.
    <br>He is giving you on condition: "Heal me - receive money".
    <br>This is an exchange of the sickness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He will bring it but it is not from his heart.
    <br>That is not an offering.
    <br>He would give me on condition that he would be healed.
    <br>It is like exchanging sickness with money.
    <br>He will give the money and the sickness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know the reason why I will not collect money directly from you - that is my principle.
    <br>I will not collect anything directly from you.
    <br>If you want to give just drop it in the box or anywhere.
    <br>And I don't want to hear what you gave.
    <br>You give to God.
    <br>These evil people - they like rewards, honor, to hear "thank you".
    <br>They want to be noticed and known.
    <br>If you don't give them that chance to be introduced to the general overseer, they will not give.
    <br>Their reward is to be noticed and known.
    <br>Their reward is not the Kingdom of God.
    <br>They don't know where they go.
    <br>Their reward is in this world - to be noticed, honoured, and respected.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is a way we can eradicate corruption in the places of worship, in the church.
    <br>It is easy to eradicate this.
    <br>General overseer does not have any links with people that want to give money.
    <br>He doesn't even know them, or allow anyone to mention about it.
    <br>... they will not give you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, they will not give you.
    <br>If my money comes from corruption, killing, stealing or destruction - the person I will give it to must honor me.
    <br>This is my reward because God will not honor me.
    <br>If God will not honor me, you, whom I give to, should honor me and respect my position.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But you, whom God inspired to give...
    <br>... you will not even want man of God to know about it.
    <br>If God inspired you to give, you would not want man of God to know this.
    <br>Because you will not want to hear "thank you" from him.
    <br>That "thank you" from the man of God will affect the blessing of God.
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God is the Rewarder.
    <br>He rewards man of God himself, He rewards you.
    <br>So, the reward of man of God is meaningless if truly God inspired you.
    <br>This is the reason why it is difficult for you to see me "one on one".
    <br>I always pray to know what a person wants to see me for.
    <br>Does this person want to give me money, or a gift?
    <br>I try to see what this person wants to give me.
    <br>If you give me and I reject it - you will not like it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>The way out for you is so simple and you are destined to be great.
    <br>No, I'm telling you.
    <br>It is that greatness that is pushing you up and down, "Go this way".
    <br>If you were not destined to be great you would not come here.
    <br>But you have not achieved that greatness.
    <br>Something is telling you that you are a head and not tail.
    <br>If you are not a head yet - that is why you are here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are many of you – God just wants you to know what is to suffer
    <br>because He wants to take you high.
    <br>If you know what it means to suffer and you achieve that greatness,
    <br>you will take care of those who are suffering.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The greatest challenge in the world we are facing today is simple.
    <br>99% of those who occupy exalted positions, who are rich, famous all over the world -
    <br>they don't know what it means to suffer.
    <br>That is why they cannot take care of those who are suffering.
    <br>It is a disaster.
    <br>I think it is the reason why it is so difficult now to reach the position of honor, fame, exaltation...
    <br>The Lord knows that people need to know what does it mean to sleep in the dark,
    <br>to be sick, to be at the point of death, to face hardship, to be lonely, to be called names, to be in prison
    <br>to go through tribulation, before you achieve the position of honor.
    <br>If you are there and you experienced sickness, poverty, imprisonment, to be lied against -
    <br>and you are in the position of honor you want to take care, you want to help people, because you remember
    <br>being in the same position.
    <br>When you see somebody suffering, and you have so many, you are in the high position
    <br>and you have gone through it - you would say, "Oh my God".
    <br>You would be crying everyday, you would want to help.
    <br>Even the governor, minister, president - they should visit prisoners at least once in a month.
    <br>There are many people who are there being held innocent.
    <br>And they have been sentenced for a life in a prison.
    <br>People put stories together and they imprison the innocent for life.
    <br>They lie against them.
    <br>You, as a governor, visit the prison and ask them to give you a table there and you tell them that
    <br>you want to see the people that have been sentenced for life in prison.
    <br>Even if there are hundred of them you would see them "one on one".
    <br>You would ask, what happened, what were their case about, why they were sentenced for a life in a prison.
    <br>If you listen to some of their stories and follow it up, you would establish the truth and save them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many are being held innocent.
    <br>This is why many of us face failures in business despite your efforts.
    <br>Opportunities are given to others instead you.
    <br>It does not mean that God is not aware.
    <br>God wants you to go through disappointment that you may know what it means to be disappointed.
    <br>When you become rich, you can know what disappointed people feel.
    <br>It is not too late.
    <br>God wants you to be strong.
    <br>It is good to be strong before you become victorious.
    <br>I thank God that I passed through all this.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Even without regard to my age, but it is good.
    <br>You will trust in authority not majority if you pass through all this.
    <br>You always trust in majority.
    <br>To trust a majority is to trust so much in people to help you,
    <br>instead of running to your prayer room, running to God.
    <br>God will be the one to tell you, "Go to this person, go to that person..."
    <br>God will choose those who will support you.
    <br>It is not you who will choose them.
    <br>He has his people and He knows His people, and He will show you His people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need a counsel, something you take home, something you meditate over.
    <br>You need it.
    <br>Look at our champions all over the world.
    <br>How many of them run the race to the end?
    <br>Our champions today - they end bad.
    <br>Many of the richest people all over the world end bad.
    <br>They often end as poor people, before they die.
    <br>Champions in all areas of life - they don't end well.
    <br>Why?
    <br>The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>Champions don't end well.
    <br>God doesn't want your journey to go like that.
    <br>He wants you to end well.
    <br>To end well is to experience trials, disappointments, appointments, failures, successes -
    <br>you have to pass through all this.
    <br>Be strong!
    <br>You have to be strong.
    <br>Forget about your age.
    <br>If you are getting too old, God can add to your age.
    <br>You will achieve what He wants you to achieve.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You look at your age, "I'm getting old now. I have not achieved this or that.
    <br>Am I going to achieve it at the age of 70?"
    <br>Forget about that.
    <br>Which kind of age are you talking about?
    <br>There are two ages.
    <br>You know one age, the other age you don't know.
    <br>God knows.
    <br>The other age is the age at which you will leave this world.
    <br>The age you know cannot tell you when you will leave this world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are two ages; the one you know - the one that started when you were born,
    <br>the other age is with God - when you will leave this world.
    <br>Any time you sit down and think about your age, remember about the other age that you don't know.
    <br>That one is more important.
    <br>What you will leave behind, if today is your last day on earth...
    <br>What you will leave behind is more important than what you claim to achieve.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Think about that other age.
    <br>Two ages.
    <br>God owns age - and you are celebrating your own age, but the God's own age is there.
    <br>So, just be happy and give thanks to God.
    <br>No matter what happened, no matter what comes - Jesus is good all the time.
    <br>It is good for you.
    <br>You just have to start as a new baby.
    <br>There are many things you don't know - like this relationship I'm talking about.
    <br>Little thing, fight, disagreement, lie; hey, today I quit, it is no longer my friend - no.
    <br>Situation should not break your relationship.
    <br>Challenges should not break a relationship.
    <br>Conditions should not break a relationship - let God Himself quit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God Himself is a Father of relationships - he should be the one to decide whether to quit.
    <br>Many of them are leaders all over the world.
    <br>You run to them saying that you knew them from the beginning.
    <br>They are leaders now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You look at names of people managing the bank - you will be surprised that you know them.
    <br>Some of them own companies.
    <br>God's will does things in mysterious ways - you have to be very careful.
    <br>If at your work place they tell that they demote you - don't leave because of this reason.
    <br>You need to ask God for the direction.
    <br>They may demote you, they may put the junior one at the superior position, they can cut a half of your salary -
    <br>don't quit because of that.
    <br>You need to examine what has happened.
    <br>God can use any foolish thing - these are the bad things - to try to address you.
    <br>And when you are given a sack letter, although you did nothing wrong, just smile - God is still saying something.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What can God say through a sack letter?
    <br>Yes, remember about those who are still alive and those who already died.
    <br>If you ask the richest people in the world, owners of big companies,
    <br>what let them to establish their own companies - it was a sack letter given to them.
    <br>If they were not given the sack letter, they would have not discovered themselves.
    <br>I have a good example.
    <br>Emmanuel TV is the first "satellite" here...
    <br>I want to give you a story.
    <br>When I was airing my program on one of the national channels...
    <br>Because of me they did not allow showing miracles in Nigeria.
    <br>Just because of me alone.
    <br>And they told me that showing miracles was not allowed.
    <br>I asked them how should I arrange my program.
    <br>They said, "Just talk. Jesus is love."
    <br>I removed all my programs from that TV station and I went to the mountain to pray.
    <br>God said, "Yes, I am aware. I want you to discover yourself. I will give you a channel called Emmanuel TV."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The name Emmanuel is too long - that is what I said to myself.
    <br>I purposely changed it to SCOAN TV.
    <br>I said Emmanuel TV was too long - but I heard it clearly - Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I said that this Emmanuel TV name would be too long.
    <br>I would need to write the whole name - Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I see other names of stations - they are all 3 or 4 letters, and why mine would be so long?
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>That is human; and God said "Emmanuel TV".
    <br>I went to register the SCOAN TV.
    <br>First two months the TV was broadcast with the name "SCOAN TV".
    <br>One night, around 2 am I had a vision; the atmosphere changed in the room.
    <br>I was warned, "When you wake up change this name to Emmanuel TV".
    <br>This is an instruction from God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We started to wrestle.
    <br>There was no way we could have done it in Nigeria.
    <br>There were no law, no relevant machines, no technologies to do it.
    <br>We had to travel to another country.
    <br>That is how Emmanuel TV started.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I if hadn't quit, would I have discovered myself?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is now the most popular Christian channel all over the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When that disappointment comes, God is speaking through that to you.
    <br>We say, "Don't cry. Don't lament. Don't despair. Don't worry. Even in case of sickness."
    <br>I know we have made a lot of mistakes in the past; in marriages, businesses...
    <br>Even if you invested in business and the whole thing went bankrupt - it is not enough to quit.
    <br>Because bankruptcy is not God.
    <br>Only God has the right to say quit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't get frustrated at all.
    <br>This world is unstable.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[This world is unstable.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[This world is unstable.]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are walking on unstable ground.
    <br>It is unstable.
    <br>This is why the Bible says, "In this world there will be trouble. There will be tribulation."
    <br>And this is why He said to Peter, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>Please!
    <br>That shows there are some challenges, situations that will come to shake you because this world is unstable.
    <br>I know right.
    <br>But you are walking in this world which is unstable.
    <br>When something happens to you, you know it is unstable.
    <br>What do you expect from a place that is not stable?
    <br>You were about to fall.
    <br>And if you are not strong enough you will fall.
    <br>But if you are strong enough you will get back to balance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not in heaven; you are in this world.
    <br>If things are going smoothly, without challenges - it is not good that all problems come in later days
    <br>because there will be no much strength in you.
    <br>This is what happens to many of you.
    <br>You have a brother, a rich man, an authority man that help you...
    <br>Your brother is a governor, president, senator, you are very strong, your brother is a rich man,
    <br>they keep helping you.
    <br>When you are about to fall they will help you.
    <br>You can just sit at home making a phone call and getting what you want...
    <br>I'm afraid.
    <br>I'm afraid the moment they will not be there for you.
    <br>I will continue to pray for you.
    <br>Take this counsel.
    <br>Take it home.
    <br>Pass on my greetings to your children, your junior ones, those who are not here.
    <br>Say to them, "T.B. Joshua greets them".
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Help me to greet them with this message.
    <br>Now, we find ourselves in the war.
    <br>We cannot tell our children, "Go this way" because you do not know which way leads to success.
    <br>You are not on the way to success either.
    <br>We don't have a road map, and we are showing the road.
    <br>Are you a road map?
    <br>No.
    <br>That is why it is so difficult for our children to follow our instructions.
    <br>They look at you, they pity you, they are the ones supporting the house.
    <br>They are the ones who counsel you.
    <br>Where is the instruction, where is the name momma, where is the name baba?
    <br>Father - what is the meaning of father?
    <br>The world has turned to that.
    <br>Pass my greetings to them and tell them, "Look, Jesus is our father".
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The only legacy you can give to your children is to show them the way to the Lord.
    <br>I'm telling you.
    <br>Your property is no longer your legacy.
    <br>Your wealth is no longer your legacy.
    <br>It is like your wealth, property, money, houses... you write a will to give it to them...
    <br>It is like you are willing trouble for them.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>I'm saying - those properties, money in the bank, you are very rich, you want to give it to your children -
    <br>it is like you are willing trouble for them.
    <br>Yes, they only will...
    <br>Show them the way of the Lord; let them achieve it themselves.
    <br>Way, where is the way?
    <br>Where is that way?
    <br>Thank you.
