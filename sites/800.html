  <p>    
    <br>On Sunday 16th April, 2017, during a Live
    <br>Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message concerning the nation, Germany.
    <br>These were his words...
    <br>I cover your nation with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>The nation Germany opened their doors for people who are in need of refuge.
    <br>Thousands of people entered their country and they protected them.
    <br>I don't know why all these challenges they
    <br>are facing.
    <br>While we are praying, I saw a train or a station where people gather -
    <br>they should protect it against attack.
    <br>For the loving hands they stretched to other nations, they do not deserve this.
    <br>They are a nation that we are proud of because of what they did for immigrants -
    <br>wonderful blessings and care they give to the immigrants.
    <br>We continue to pray for them.
    <br>They should protect their stations, their
    <br>trains because I am seeing a similar thing
    <br>that happened in Russia last time -
    <br>I am seeing some funny people are there to
    <br>play funny.
    <br>So, we'll continue to continue to pray with
    <br>them.
    <br>Pray for them - the Lord will protect them.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
