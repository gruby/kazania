    <br>FRUIT OF THE WOMB 2009
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Fruit Of The Womb Meeting
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The Lord gave a prophetic word for you for the title of our message.
    <br>When I say prophetic word for you - the title:
    <br>THERE IS A WAY OUT
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>If there is a way out, you need to be positioned
    <br>because blind Bartimaeus was positioned where Jesus heard his cry.
    <br>Hannah was positioned where God Almighty heard her lamentation.
    <br>You need to be positioned.
    <br>While you are sitting down, continue to say, "Jesus, position me."
    <br>Position me
    <br>where You will hear my petition.
    <br>Right now, begin to say to Jesus, "Position me, Lord."
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen - ask Jesus to position you.
    <br>If you are positioned, leave it for God.
    <br>Position me where I will attract Your attention.
    <br>My cry will attract Your attention.
    <br>My complaint will attract Your attention.
    <br>My meditation will attract Your attention.
    <br>My lamentation will attract Your attention.
    <br>My looking will attract Your attention.
    <br>My silence will attract Your attention.
    <br>Position me Lord!
    <br>Rise up and say, "Position me Lord!"
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>You have many different prayer points that the Lord has put in your heart.
    <br>Whatever comes out of your lips today;
    <br>as it should be by divine will.
    <br>I want you to pick your prayer point and fire on, right now.
    <br>Fire on!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>Satan is a liar.
    <br>Right now, take back your circumstances from the hands of the devil.
    <br>Instead of saying it is witches and wizards that are doing this - no, I don't believe that.
    <br>"A nightmare, it is a generational curse.
    <br>I am barren, my sister is barren too, it is in our family. The cause is satan."
    <br>No, we are not here for that.
    <br>Right now, take back your circumstances from the hands of the devil.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>When you take back your circumstances from the hands of satan, there is a way out.
    <br>Say, "There is a way out."
    <br>There is a way out.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Have you taken back your circumstances from the hands of the devil?
    <br>Your situation - you have taken it back from the hands of satan, devil.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>The situation is under control.
    <br>We are not here to glorify anyone, but Jesus Christ.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Your prayers of many years are not lost.
    <br>I know that more than half of the population here are from other living churches.
    <br>Your prayers right from your churches are not lost at all.
    <br>You are here to receive.
    <br>As you are sitting down, something is going on.
    <br>The Holy Spirit has 'injected' you.
    <br>I say you are injected!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>The way out has come!
    <br>Place your hand wherever you have that affliction.
    <br>Place your hand, I will speak and God will make it happen.
    <br>I say I will speak, the Lord will make it happen.
    <br>When I speak, Lord will make it happen.
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I cannot wait.
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>Can you hear me?
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>Place the hands!
    <br>Fire on!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Place your hands.
    <br>Those of you that have fibroids, delayed pregnancy, low sperm count, whatever is your trouble,
    <br>I can see it happen.
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>Fire on!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Watch your screen and see what is happening everywhere in the auditorium right now
    <br>and outside the auditorium.
    <br>Sick people are coming out to vomit blood substances, all the poison in their systems
    <br>of so many years.
    <br>Look at people coming out in their numbers, vomiting out right now.
    <br>Let us continue to watch our screen as we pray.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Those of you that are outside;
    <br>the Lord is aware that you are outside there.
    <br>Those of you that are outside there;
    <br>right now, place your hands.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Fire on!
    <br>People are coming out to urinate or vomit out all the problems in their lives.
    <br>Continue to watch your screen.
    <br>Substances of different colours are what they are vomiting out.
    <br>These are the poisons that have been in their systems for so long.
    <br>This is your day of deliverance.
    <br>Begin to receive your deliverance.
    <br>Deliverance from fibroid,
    <br>from barrenness
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are watching the overflow of crowds outside the church auditorium.
    <br>This is a section of the overflow crowd outside the church,
    <br>that came for the 2009 Fruit Of The Womb meeting.
    <br>They are joining Prophet T.B. Joshua and the congregation in prayer,
    <br>believing distance is not a barrier for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>As the prayer continued, people fell under the anointing of God
    <br>and the problems in their lives were cast out.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua went to the midst of the overflow crowd
    <br>and the mighty power of God continued to flow in the lives of the people,
    <br>setting them free from their affliction.
    <br>Many vomited, sweating or passing poisonous substances out of their bodies.
    <br>The lightning of God flashes from place to place, all over The SCOAN's ground,
    <br>as the anointing of God fought against the power of darkness,
    <br>to bring about healing, deliverance and the long awaited blessing they have been seeking for.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>More people continue to pass out what is not planted by Jesus in their systems,
    <br>as the Holy Spirit walked among them, uprooting what was not of God
    <br>and replacing it with what is of Jesus.
    <br>As far as the eye can see, people are in an attitude of prayer
    <br>with the firm confidence that the way out for their lives had come.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua went to every section of the overflow crowd,
    <br>stretching his hand, strengthening their faith and joining them in prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Bible says in Isaiah 53:5, by His wounds we are healed.
    <br>The price has been paid for the blessing they seek and it is offered freely.
    <br>The man of God continues to move around the entire premises,
    <br>stretching forth his right hand in prayer, to declare freedom, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>over all those who had come.
    <br>He then proceeds back into the auditorium.
    <br>Whatever the cause of barrenness, unfruitfulness,
    <br>the Lord should remove it right now, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen. We are now back, inside the church.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>Say, "I am very close in the name of Jesus Christ."
    <br>You are declared free today.
    <br>Be declared free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Free!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The healing has come.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays over a section of women who have complications in their pregnancies,
    <br>before walking among the congregation to touch and pray for them one on one,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As the prophet touches them, in the name of Jesus, you can see instant reactions.
    <br>Many shaking and crying out loud, as they fall under the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The presence of God is irresistible.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>That is the problem in her life - it is gone.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Allow the Spirit of God to touch us - the touch that will bring about the difference in our lives.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Continue to watch your screen, at what we are seeing live and direct.
    <br>The man of God is moving in the midst of the people.
    <br>I brought this here because of you people.
    <br>Because I know I will not be able to go around, that is why I brought it here.
    <br>This is a mantle - like the apron Paul the Apostle used.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Watch the reaction of this woman.
    <br>The man of God placed the anointed mantle on the body of this woman
    <br>and prayed, making it happen.
    <br>Immediately, the lady sensed the change and checking herself
    <br>reveals a fibroid has come out of her body, after being touched by the anointed mantle.
    <br>You can see the medical report she has which diagnosed the problem of uterine fibroids.
    <br>Let's listen to her testimony.
    <br>My name is Tuoyo Faith.
    <br>I am from Enugu State.
    <br>I came here with the problem of uterine fibroids.
    <br>I was booked for an operation at St. Louis' Hospital.
    <br>So, I ran down to The SCOAN.
    <br>The moment the man of God prayed for me and touched me with the mantle,
    <br>I delivered my fibroid.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>Having delivered her fibroid, live, in the congregation, after being touched by the mantle,
    <br>Mrs Tuoyo Faith was taken to the ladies room to remove the rest of the fibroid.
    <br>We all learned about Paul the Apostle.
    <br>This is the apron you read so much about in the Bible.
    <br>I am going to release it.
    <br>You hold it - pray.
    <br>I want to release it now and I will drop it here - just touch it.
    <br>And now begin to pray, while you are standing.
    <br>Don't hold it long - just a touch.
    <br>A touch and release it!
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>OK, it is alright.
    <br>Begin to pray.
    <br>As people are touching the mantle, see what is happening.
    <br>You see them falling under the anointing.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>Keep praying!
    <br>Let us continue to pray, and watch your screen.
    <br>See what is happening - the man on the floor.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>When the mantle had been passed to those on the altar,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua retrieved the mantle and began to touch the pulpit with it.
    <br>Taking the mantle in his hand, Prophet T.B. Joshua then ascended to the top of the altar.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>We shall receive a full dose of that anointing today.
    <br>The man of God has gone on the top of the altar,
    <br>wiping the pulpit with the mantle.
    <br>Right now, let us be prepared with faith, as you touch the mantle.
    <br>Barrenness will be gone.
    <br>Just be prepared, right now.
    <br>Just a touch is enough.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>I am seeing the man of God right there, continuing to wipe the Bible and the items on the altar.
    <br>This mantle is all you need.
    <br>Just a touch is enough to change your problem into solution,
    <br>your barrenness into fruitfulness.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Let us get ready.
    <br>Today is the day - let us get ready.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Who is there that believes his problem will not be solved today?
    <br>When I told you that I can see you being saved,
    <br>I said, I can see you being delivered.
    <br>This must come to pass.
    <br>Look!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>This mantle - what you read in the Bible is nothing but the truth.
    <br>Everyone that touched the mantle, apron of Apostle Paul was delivered.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>It is for you for a touch.
    <br>OK, brother!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>The stranger in your life - now, begin to come out.
    <br>If you are pressed, go to toilet.
    <br>I am telling you - you are free now.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>People trembled and fell, as the power of God set them free,
    <br>after just a touch of the anointed mantle.
    <br>As it was in the days of Apostle Paul, so it is today.
    <br>Everyone was delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>and their problems became a thing of the past.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>People are touching it - see them falling under the anointing,
    <br>and the problem of barrenness, infertility becomes a thing of the past immediately.
    <br>Continue to watch your screen.
    <br>Those of you that I have touched, begin to pray because your body is not a house of fibroid, sickness.
    <br>Watch the screen of the TV set and see what is happening.
    <br>Immediately that woman held the mantle - you can see what happened to her.
    <br>Watch your screen - there is another woman passing out her fibroid.
    <br>This is happening live and direct.
    <br>It is happening right now.
    <br>The man of God has said - immediately you touch the mantle,
    <br>run to the ladies and deliver your fibroid.
    <br>My name is Mrs Tina Okafor.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was multiple fibroids and barrenness - for a long time.
    <br>The doctor told me that I will do an operation.
    <br>Immediately I touched the mantle, the fibroid just came out.
    <br>So, no more fibroids, no more barrenness, no more operation.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>Fibroid, whatever disease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>I want you to begin to declare them 'wanted', right now.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>That is a fibroid that has just dropped from that woman.
    <br>She is at the ladies right now.
    <br>The apron you have touched already has put everything down.
    <br>Now, it is either you get home and go to toilet and find it dropped,
    <br>or tomorrow morning while you will be sleeping, you will start having stomach running,
    <br>or tomorrow evening, but all I know...
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>this is an apron that has been affected by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Touch it and be healed.
    <br>Touch it and be delivered.
    <br>Touch it and be saved.
    <br>Touch it and be redeemed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Can you tell us what was the cause of these many years of barrenness, unfruitfulness
    <br>in your lives before you met our Lord, Jesus Christ?
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Shedrack Ayisire, from Delta State.
    <br>We were here last year on December 5th 2008, for the Fruit Of The Womb Meeing
    <br>and before we came we had been experiencing a pregnancy delay
    <br>of three years after we did CS [cesarean section] on our first baby.
    <br>Since then we have been hoping for another baby but pregnancy was not forthcoming
    <br>though the operation was somehow critical then.
    <br>So, we became troubled that maybe things went wrong with the operation.
    <br>My wife started questioning me that is there anything that I was withholding from her.
    <br>Why were the things delaying?
    <br>Why were things like that?
    <br>We went back to the doctors and consulted him.
    <br>We did other tests that confirmed we were alright but what was the problem?
    <br>We kept holding onto God.
    <br>We further sought herbs.
    <br>My wife got the information of the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting.
    <br>My wife was stirred up.
    <br>She said, "This is where we must go."
    <br>When I came, I said "Wow" - the service was really hot, the power was so strong.
    <br>When man of God prayed, we held on to that as we came, we were blessed.
    <br>During the course of the prayer, I made up my mind and said,
    <br>"God, as I came to this place, I am going home with my baby boy.
    <br>And I will come back to dedicate him and give him a name - Emmanuel."
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>When we got home after the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting, I met with my wife as husband and wife.
    <br>Before January, signs were coming out and things were changing.
    <br>What was happening?
    <br>I knew His Word stood sure.
    <br>I told my wife to hold still that God had done it.
    <br>She said, "But" - I said, "Nothing 'but' just wait."
    <br>Four months after that, we went for a pregnancy test.
    <br>Today, we are here with our baby boy, Emmanuel.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>My name is Mrs Esther Ayisire.
    <br>My baby's name is Emmanuel.
    <br>We were here for the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting as you are here today.
    <br>In my case, the doctor said that there is no way for me to be pregnant.
    <br>All the doctors in Warri (Delta State, Nigeria), most of them know me.
    <br>Any time I go to their office, they will say, "Mrs Shadrack, you are here again."
    <br>When I heard about the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting, I called my husband and said,
    <br>"This meeting, we must be there, this is my last bus stop."
    <br>As you are here, this is your last bus stop.
    <br>This is the arena of solution, it is the arena of liberty.
    <br>When we were here, the man of God said that we should place our hands wherever there was pain.
    <br>So, I placed my hands and said, "You tummy - that womb, you must come back.
    <br>With this womb I must carry this pregnancy."
    <br>You know, I vomited some substances.
    <br>Afterwards, we met as husband and wife.
    <br>By January, I felt funny.
    <br>I remembered when doctor said, "It is a 50:50 chance for me to be pregnant."
    <br>Because every doctor said, "Mrs Shadrack, there is no way for you to be pregnant."
    <br>One day, I called my husband and said, "Honey, are you sure that I am not going to be pregnant again?"
    <br>My husband said, "No".
    <br>I said, "Tell me the truth".
    <br>Anytime I see a pregnant woman, I cry.
    <br>Anytime I see a little baby, I cry.
    <br>In the night, when people are sleeping, I cry.
    <br>When I was pregnant, I said, "Doctor, this is the baby. You said that I could not be pregnant.
    <br>But now look at the baby."
    <br>Anytime I bathed, I would say, "So, it is a real baby that is inside this womb!
    <br>OK, let me wait and see."
    <br>Four months, five months, six months.
    <br>We went for a scan.
    <br>I told the doctor to tell me the sex of the baby.
    <br>He said, "It's a baby boy". I said, "No, are you sure that it's a baby that is in this womb?"
    <br>He said, "Yes".
    <br>So, I said, "Let me see."
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>In short, most of the hospitals in Warri know me.
    <br>I go to their hospitals and I would say, "How are you today?"
    <br>They would say, "Fine."
    <br>One day, one of the doctors called and said, "Mrs Shadrack, this is a miracle baby."
    <br>I said, "In short, a covenant baby."
    <br>God has really done it for me and today I am here with my baby.
    <br>That womb that they say I could not get pregnant - now here I am with my baby.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>As you are here today, don't allow your neighbour to discourage you
    <br>because when the man of God came out, I started looking at his eyes, eye ball to eye ball.
    <br>I called my husband, my husband was at the back.
    <br>I said, "God, distance is not a barrier, we are going home with our baby."
    <br>I said, "We are going to name our baby today and we are going to call him Emmanuel."
    <br>Today, this is our baby.
    <br>Today, I am a mother.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus?
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>Every Word of God is spirit and life.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua declared that the way our for them had come,
    <br>truly, a few months after Mrs Faith Otunyo delivered a fibroid
    <br>during The Fruit Of The Womb Meeting with T.B. Joshua,
    <br>she came back to share her wonderful testimony.
    <br>Let's listen to her.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>If God is with us...
    <br>My name is Mrs Faith Nkechi Otunyo.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is uterine fibroid
    <br>accompanied with severe abdominal pains and barrenness.
    <br>When I was sick, I underwent a series of tests all to no avail.
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV and decided to run to The SCOAN after being booked for an operation.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN,
    <br>I attended the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting.
    <br>During the prayer, the man of God came to me with the mantle and
    <br>immediately he touched me with it, I started shivering all over and the fibroid came out of me.
    <br>That was the beginning of my revival.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, I was a dying woman.
    <br>I was nothing but a moving corpse.
    <br>Ordinary clothes were heavy for me.
    <br>People that saw me on that day would testify to what I am saying.
    <br>Immediately the fibroid came out of me, after I touched the mantle,
    <br>life came to me, my voice changed.
    <br>I knew I had a new beginning.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>When I got back, people that saw me as a dying woman were scared of me.
    <br>But I knew life has entered into me.
    <br>Gradually, I started reviving.
    <br>I met with my husband in the month of February and conceived.
    <br>When I was pregnant - this is one of the pictures I took in the office just to show I was pregnant.
    <br>I took the picture to be able to answer my enemies.
    <br>While I was barren, I faced a lot of humiliation.
    <br>I am the first born in my family but the last one to have a child.
    <br>I was rejected and treated badly.
    <br>But to God be the glory, the moment I became pregnant, things became easy.
    <br>I did not have to look for what to eat.
    <br>Things became stable for me and my husband.
    <br>Not only that, my delivery was very safe and free, with no complications.
    <br>This is one of the pictures taken of me in the early stags of my pregnancy.
    <br>Look at me - a revived woman, the woman that is alive now, full of joy and life.
    <br>To God be the glory, I have little Divine Emmanuel Eedene Otunyo.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>My name is Mrs Florence Unuajohwofia from Delta State.
    <br>I was barren for 16 years.
    <br>I went to many places but found no solution.
    <br>In 2009, I watched The Fruit Of The Womb Meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>As the man of God was praying, he said that everyone with a problem should touch the screen.
    <br>I touched the screen.
    <br>After touching the screen, I met my husband as husband and wife.
    <br>After that I got pregnant.
    <br>This is that baby in my hands here.
    <br>The man standing beside me here is my lovely husband.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>This is the baby.
    <br>Her name is Princess Temitope.
    <br>THE MOST POWERFUL CHURCH SERVICE EVER!!! â›ªðŸ”¥
    <br>I thank God today that I am a mother
    <br>because when I was barren for 16 years, I have been rejected by my family.
    <br>Even when I was pregnant, my family rejected me.
    <br>I thank the Almighty God for what He has done for us.
    <br>That was a trial time.
    <br>To be barren for 16 years was not a joke.
    <br>I thank God that with God, all things are possible.
