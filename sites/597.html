    <br>Businessmen and Women's Fellowship With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Australia
    <br>Amazing grace
    <br>How sweet the sound
    <br>That saved a wretch like me
    <br>I once was lost but now am found
    <br>Was blind but now I see
    <br>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
    <br>And grace my fears relieved
    <br>How precious did that grace appear
    <br>The hour I first believed
    <br>Through many dangers toils and snares
    <br>I have already come
    <br>'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
    <br>And grace will lead me home
    <br>Businessmen and Women's Fellowship With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Australia
    <br>May the Holy Spirit who dwells in our hearts be the voice of our prayer,
    <br>- Amen
    <br>be the voice of our message.
    <br>- Amen
    <br>Before I entered here, the Lord gave me a message, titled:
    <br>RESPONSIBLE USE OF BLESSING
    <br>A Message For Business Men & Women - "Responsible Use Of Blessing"
    <br>I will take my reading from the book of Galatians 6 verses 1, 7, 9 and 10.
    <br>"Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin,
    <br>you who are spiritual should restore him gently."
    <br>Verse 7: "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
    <br>The one who sows to please his sinful nature,
    <br>from that nature will reap destruction.
    <br>The one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
    <br>Let us not become weary in doing good".
    <br>The last verse: "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people,
    <br>especially to those who belong to the family of God".
    <br>When you get home, take time to read from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>When you look at this message, Paul is warning us about sowing and reaping.
    <br>Whatever a man sows, that he reaps.
    <br>While the earth remains, seed time and harvest shall not end.
    <br>A Message For Business Men & Women - "Responsible Use Of Blessing"
    <br>Seed time and harvest all began with the way God saved us.
    <br>In John 3 verse 16, "God so loved ... that He gave ..."
    <br>There can be no loving in truth and in faith without giving.
    <br>It all began with the way God saved us.
    <br>And there can be no giving in truth without receiving.
    <br>There can be no planting in truth without reaping.
    <br>We always reap the same kind of seed we plant.
    <br>That is, if you plant love in truth, you will receive love.
    <br>This means, love and be loved.
    <br>If you plant help in truth, you will receive help.
    <br>Help and be helped.
    <br>If you plant kindness, you receive kindness.
    <br>This means, be kind and receive kindness.
    <br>If you plant mercy, you'll receive mercy.
    <br>This means, show mercy and receive mercy.
    <br>That is, in truth.
    <br>When you look at life in general, you will see that when you give in truth,
    <br>you will receive more of whatever you give. In truth.
    <br>If you give in truth, you are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to you.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself: Am I really planting in truth?
    <br>Am I really giving in truth? What are you doing?
    <br>We are saying: In sincerity and humility of mind, you will receive more of it in return.
    <br>I will take you to the book of Mark 12 verse 41.
    <br>"The Widow's Offering".
    <br>"Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put
    <br>and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury.
    <br>Many rich people threw in large amounts,
    <br>but the poor widow came and put two very small copper coins,
    <br>worth only a fraction of a cent".
    <br>Verse 43: "Calling His disciples to Him, Jesus said,
    <br>"I tell you the truth. This poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
    <br>They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put everything - all she had to live on."
    <br>We are talking about responsible use of blessing.
    <br>When you do not know the purpose of your blessing,
    <br>you are bound to do foolish things that will cost you your life.
    <br>What are the foolish things?
    <br>Immorality, smoking, all sorts of things that can destroy your system or body.
    <br>The widow's mite - she used all her substance to show her love. The Bible says that she never held back.
    <br>A Message For Business Men & Women - "Responsible Use Of Blessing"
    <br>You will give an unworthy offering when you don't know the purpose of your blessing.
    <br>What do I mean by 'unworthy offering'?
    <br>When I say 'offering', it does not mean money alone, no.
    <br>Unworthily - in terms of your time, in terms of your strength,
    <br>in terms of your love, in terms of your money, every good thing the Lord has given you.
    <br>When you give an unworthy offering, you are not only holding back but also lying to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>There are two things there to take note of:
    <br>Holding back and lying to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So, we are talking of the responsible use of blessing.
    <br>God has blessed us so much but because we are holding back ...
    <br>That is, you feel that God does not know you, does not know what He has given you.
    <br>In the business you are doing, He is there. He is everywhere - omnipresent.
    <br>When you are negotiating for the business, He is there.
    <br>When they pay you, He is there.
    <br>When they are about to give to you, He is there.
    <br>When you are crying to get the business, He is there.
    <br>When you finally receive the money, He is there.
    <br>And He knows that this is it; you have received it.
    <br>But when it is time to give an offering, 'Thank You, Lord', you hold back.
    <br>When we talk of a 'worthy offering', what do I mean by 'worthy offering'?
    <br>I mean every good thing the Lord has given you.
    <br>1. You know what God has given you - your time is one of the good things God has given you.
    <br>2. Your faith.
    <br>3. Your love.
    <br>4. Your strength.
    <br>5. Your money, and so on and so forth - every good thing.
    <br>This is what I mean by worthy offering.
    <br>Let us have a look at this one - your time
    <br>Today, many give their best time to the lures and cares of the world,
    <br>but give the time they do not need to God.
    <br>A Message For Business Men & Women - "Responsible Use Of Blessing"
    <br>When I say you give the time you do not need to God,
    <br>it is one of the unworthy offerings I am talking about.
    <br>A good example: You quickly rush to the church.
    <br>You always rush to see God. When it is time to worship God - rush.
    <br>You give God a time.
    <br>If the pastor does not conclude the message within that time,
    <br>you see them grumble: "Tut-tut, I'm leaving the service".
    <br>Your best time, you give it to the clubs and many beautiful things out there.
    <br>You don't rush to the beautiful place in the world, but you rush to God and you rush out.
    <br>I want to say something you don't want to hear, but never mind.
    <br>Death.
    <br>How can I die and leave the whole property and wealth and my children and everything?
    <br>You see brother, that death is coming some day and you have not been told when that will be.
    <br>It could be when you are in the club or when you are driving - death will ust come. It could be anywhere.
    <br>It could even be a cough that leads to death.
    <br>It could be the time you say to your wife,
    <br>"Please, tomorrow morning, help me and wake me up at 5 o'clock; I want to go somewhere".
    <br>When it's time, they say, "Wake up, wake up! What is wrong with you?". "No, he has gone".
    <br>That death is coming some day and you have not been told when that will be.
    <br>"When I see Jesus some day" - can you give us the song?
    <br>I've got my mind made up
    <br>And I won't turn back
    <br>Because I want to see my Jesus some day
    <br>I've got my mind made up
    <br>And I won't turn back
    <br>Because I want to see my Jesus some day
    <br>Goodbye world
    <br>I'll stay no longer with you
    <br>Goodbye pleasures of sin
    <br>I'll stay no longer with you
    <br>I've made up my mind
    <br>To go God's way all the rest of my life
    <br>I've made up my mind
    <br>To go God's way all the rest of my life
    <br>That death is coming some day; you have not been told when that will be.
    <br>Have you been told?
    <br>If you have been told, what then will you do? That is the song for you.
    <br>Love with all your substance.
    <br>Let us not love only in words, but in deed and in truth.
    <br>A Message For Business Men & Women - "Responsible Use Of Blessing"
    <br>Let us not love only in word - take note of that - but in deed and in truth.
    <br>Since you have not been told, and that death is coming some day
    <br>- and you have not been told - what will you do?
    <br>Death.
    <br>Therefore, treat yourself as well as you can and bring a worthy offering to the Lord.
    <br>Worthy worthy is the Lamb
    <br>That was slain
    <br>Glory hallelujah
    <br>Praise the Lamb
    <br>As I told you, when you give unworthily in terms of your time, in terms of your faith,
    <br>in terms of your strength, you are not only holding back but also lying to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Instead of you giving the best time to God, you give the time you do not need.
    <br>Your 'rush, rush, rush' time.
    <br>If the pastor does not round off within that time, you are rushing
    <br>because you have given God a time.
    <br>'Let me quickly rush to the church' - you begin to grumble and leave the service.
    <br>The time you do not need, you offer God.
    <br>Your best time, you give to the lures and cares of the world.
    <br>The Bible says that when you give a worthy offering
    <br>- every good thing the Lord had given you -
    <br>you will reap an abundance in return of the same blessing.
    <br>It is not only money.
    <br>Your time is one of the substances the Lord demands for.
    <br>What happened to Ananias and the wife is a good example of what I am talking about.
    <br>When you take your time to read the book of Acts 5 from verse 1 to the end,
    <br>they did not only hold back, they also lied to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Every day you keep lying to the Holy Spirit but He is all-knowing.
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>When you hide in the East, He is there; North, He is there; South, He is there;
    <br>He is everywhere, He is omnipresent.
    <br>Please, stop rushing.
    <br>Stop giving God the time you do not need.
    <br>You keep on giving good time for your hair, for your body,
    <br>but to God - your Creator - you continue to give the time you do not need.
    <br>Stop giving God the time you do not need.
    <br>He deserves your best!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: God deserves my best -
    <br>the best of my time,
    <br>the best of my faith,
    <br>the best of every good thing from me.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>A Message For Business Men & Women - "Responsible Use Of Blessing"
    <br>God is everything to me and God deserves everything from me.
    <br>- I agree with that.
    <br>- Thank you. Okay.
    <br>God has given His best for me and I've got to give my best to Him in everything.
    <br>He deserves the best from me.
    <br>We have to stop rushing.
    <br>We have to give God all the best in times of prayer and fellowship with Him
    <br>and not just rush off and fellowship with the world.
    <br>When you say 'prayer', there are two prayers -
    <br>prayers that spring from need and prayers that spring from emotion.
    <br>A Message For Business Men & Women - "Responsible Use Of Blessing"
    <br>Prayers that spring from need and the one that springs from what? Emotion - that is, feelings.
    <br>To have the prayer that springs from need, your mind must be disciplined
    <br>to become your servant, not your master.
    <br>When your mind becomes your servant, you will not rush to God.
    <br>That is what we call spirit prayer - prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit springs from need.
    <br>For you to have a strong prayer life, your mind must be disciplined
    <br>to become your servant, not your master.
    <br>It is time for prayer.
    <br>Businessmen and Women's Fellowship With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Australia
    <br>May the Holy Spirit who dwells in our hearts be the voice of our prayer,
    <br>be the voice of our message and give us utterances
    <br>so that you will offer prayer that springs from need, not from emotion.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit to come into your heart and sanctify it.
    <br>My mind needs to be sanctified to be my servant, not my master
    <br>so that I can offer prayers that spring from need, not from emotion, feelings.
    <br>When a prayer springs from emotions, like when a man of God says,
    <br>"In the name of Jesus", you say, "Amen" - not that you believe.
    <br>That is conventional - traditional belief.
    <br>You must say, "Amen" because you believe.
    <br>Don't say, "Amen" because the man of God says, "In the name of Jesus".
    <br>Say, "Amen" because you believe.
    <br>This is prayer that springs from need.
    <br>Believing is your connection.
    <br>Right now, ask God, "Come into my heart and sanctify it".
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Those who believe, say, "Amen".
