  <p>    
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- I am fine, sir.
    <br>- You left where you were living before.
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>What is the cause?
    <br>- I am seeing your heart.
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>- There is bleeding.
    <br>- Yes, I have the report here.
    <br>- Internal bleeding.
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Bring it out.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>It is an attack.
    <br>There is a woman you met in your dream.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Even two days ago.
    <br>Any time you meet this woman, you will bleed profusely in your heart.
    <br>When you go to the toilet, you see traces of blood.
    <br>Fresh blood. You are right, Man of God.
    <br>Yes, I confirm it. The mum was complaining this morning to me.
    <br>Don't worry. Once you are delivered and this woman stops this nonsense...
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>He is free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>They have booked him for an operation.
    <br>He has used many tablets and he cannot stop.
    <br>They would have to open the heart and correct it.
    <br>For a young man to open his heart, what kind of life does he want to live after that?
    <br>He is free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free! I am delivered!
    <br>I am free today! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>I feel so happy and very light.
    <br>I feel very delighted and happy.
    <br>This is the second time they have given me this report for an operation.
    <br>One was in South Africa and this is the second one here in Nigeria.
    <br>In your heart - because your heart used to shake - how do you feel now?
    <br>I feel relieved and as if something has gone out of my body.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The Lord is good!
    <br>My name is Izuchukwu Ohadiagu
    <br>I reside in South Africa but I am originally from Nigeria.
    <br>The woman by my side here is my mother, Mrs Betty Ohadiagu.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was bleeding haemorrhoids
    <br>which had started from my heart.
    <br>Last week Sunday, I received a word of prophecy
    <br>that changed the whole situation from negative to positive,
    <br>from Prophet T.B. Joshua, the man of God.
    <br>As you have seen in the video clip, the man of God walked up to me and asked me
    <br>if he could speak to me and I said, "Yes, sir."
    <br>He said he could see bleeding from my heart, which I confirmed to be true.
    <br>He further said that it was an attack, that there was a woman I would see in my dreams.
    <br>I confirm everything to be true.
    <br>It is the truth and nothing but the truth.
    <br>It all started in 2007.
    <br>When I slept, I saw a strange bird; it was black and very big.
    <br>The bird perched on my mouth and something was exchanged.
    <br>When I woke up, I became very tired and weak.
    <br>Since that time, I had started experiencing heart pain.
    <br>It would feel like it had stopped, but it would still continue.
    <br>I travelled out of the country with that problem; I believed it would be over.
    <br>After some months, I felt blood draining out of my heart.
    <br>Each time I tried to breathe, I would begin to pant.
    <br>I would walk a little distance and begin to pant and gasp for breath.
    <br>I went to the hospital and after all the examinations,
    <br>the doctor told me that the best thing to do would be to go for an operation
    <br>in order to rectify that problem.
    <br>I said, "No."
    <br>When they told me, I was afraid because if they were to open my heart at my age,
    <br>their efforts may not work.
    <br>It was not one hundred percent guaranteed that if I went for an operation,
    <br>that I would make it or whether it would be successful.
    <br>I said, "No."
    <br>The doctor gave me the first report.
    <br>This is the first report instructing me to go for surgery.
    <br>I decided to leave the hospital and travel back to Nigeria;
    <br>I thought I could receive different results.
    <br>When I went to the hospital, I received the same result.
    <br>I wondered what I was going to do at my age, to be operated from my heart down to my stomach.
    <br>All efforts to rectify the problem, including tablets and other mediums, did not work.
    <br>Since I started watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>I had seen a lot of people who had problems - worse than my own -
    <br>coming to The SCOAN to testify what God had done for them.
    <br>If God could heal a leg ulcer, my case would be simple with faith.
    <br>My mum and I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was hoping that God would speak to me through the man of God.
    <br>Last week Sunday, the man of God walked up to me and I confirm what he said to be true.
    <br>Each time I would see a lady in my dreams,
    <br>I would excrete blood when I would defecate.
    <br>To the extent that I could finish a role of tissue in one sitting.
    <br>The blood would appear as if I was urinating through my anus.
    <br>When I would look into the toilet bowl, everything was red.
    <br>I became very weak and tired because of this problem.
    <br>I told my mum we should go to The SCOAN, that God would locate us here.
    <br>We came here to The SCOAN and as you have seen, the man of God spoke to me.
    <br>The moment he prayed for me, a strange being that I'd seen in my dream in 2007, left my body immediately.

    <br>The moment he prayed for me, that strange being left my body.
    <br>Before, any little noise, I would become afraid; you would see my heart beating.
    <br>It would be as if somebody threw a big piece of iron or something at my chest.
    <br>This had resulted from the problem I had.
    <br>The moment he prayed for me, I stood up and felt very light and happy.
    <br>It was a kind of happiness as if I had won a lottery.
    <br>I said, "God, You are so merciful."
    <br>Since that day until today, I have not seen blood in my faeces.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>What message do you have for the viewers all over the world?
    <br>The only message of advice I have for viewers all over the world is that
    <br>no matter how lengthy your problem may appear to be,
    <br>in every situation, God is still saying something.
    <br>When I was passing through this problem, I went to a lot of witch doctors.
    <br>Some would tell me to do this, perform this, but it was a waste of time.
    <br>Never run away from God, rather move closer to Him
    <br>and He will meet you at the point of your need, the way He met me.
    <br>Emmanuel!
