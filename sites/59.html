    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Wise Man Christopher moves throughout the congregation,
    <br>ministering prayer in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As he does so, the foundations of the problems in the lives of the people begin to crumble.
    <br>All power in Heaven and on earth has been invested in that name Jesus Christ.
    <br>At the mention of the name Jesus Christ every force of the adversary has to bow.
    <br>As Wise Man Christopher moves along one of the rows, he encounters this man,
    <br>and the evil spirit is exposed and begins to verbalise its destructive plans.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Speak out - who are you!
    <br>Why do you want to know?
    <br>Jesus wants. Talk!
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I told you that we want to destroy his life.
    <br>How many of you? You said "we". How many of you?
    <br>We are many.
    <br>Mention your names.
    <br>I am the wife.
    <br>One.
    <br>Idol from his family, his father's side.
    <br>Two.
    <br>Who else?
    <br>We have been sent to destroy his life. He wants to serve God.
    <br>We are agents of lucifer.
    <br>You are agents of who?
    <br>Lucifer. We want to kill him. Why does he want to serve God?
    <br>In his family, he is the only one. He wants to serve God. Why?
    <br>We want to destroy his life.
    <br>How do you want to go about it?
    <br>We want to kill him.
    <br>What means have you chosen to destroy him?
    <br>What are the methods?
    <br>We wanted to kill him by accident.
    <br>When he was coming here, he was involved in two accidents but he didn’t die.
    <br>He would be praying every day. Why?
    <br>What stopped you from killing him through accident?
    <br>He has been praying. He always has the Anointing Water with him. Why?
    <br>He always has what?
    <br>That water.
    <br>How does prayer affect you?
    <br>You said he has been praying with Anointing Water. How does prayer...
    <br>Don’t you know that it is fire?
    <br>It destroys our kingdom.
    <br>Look at this.
    <br>I don’t want to look at this thing.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Why do you want me to look at it?
    <br>What is in it that is against you?
    <br>We don't like it.
    <br>It is fire.
    <br>That is fire.
    <br>Is it the same anointing water that stopped you from killing him?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is the same thing, the same one.
    <br>You say that you are an agent of lucifer.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Where do you operate from?
    <br>We have got so many strategies that we use on him.
    <br>We sleep with him in his dreams.
    <br>When he wakes up, he would realise that we had come.
    <br>He always wakes up in the night waiting for us to come so that he can pray but we never appear to him.
    <br>He thinks that he is smart. 
    <br>We are smarter than him.
    <br>Sometimes he doesn’t sleep, he would just be awake to see if we would come.
    <br>If he passed out for five minutes, we would come and sleep with him.
    <br>We don’t want him to serve God.
    <br>When he was coming here, we did everything possible to send him to jail.
    <br>He spent two weeks in jail. He was detained at immigration.
    <br>Two weeks; he was in jail in South Africa. He was detained.
    <br>We did it.
    <br>We don't want him to get delivered.
    <br>When we sleep with him, he cannot do anything.
    <br>When he wakes up, he cannot pray.
    <br>Sometimes he cannot even serve in the church he is committed to.
    <br>When it is a time to go to church, he would just feel a severe headache we put in him.
    <br>Then he would be struggling.
    <br>His career - he has been working, doing everything but he will not make it in life.
    <br>He has a heart to help people.
    <br>We wanted to prevent him from coming here.
    <br>First - when he made up his mind to come here - his passport, he couldn't find it.
    <br>Who hid the passport?
    <br>We did.
    <br>How?
    <br>We could see what he was planning to do.
    <br>So, we hid the passport.
    <br>Then he managed - he was praying and fasting - he got the passport.
    <br>He was arranging his documents.
    <br>We stopped the document at Home Affairs in South Africa.
    <br>He wanted to come here and get delivered. For what?
    <br>Finally, he managed to do an emergency travel document.
    <br>When he got to the airport, he was stopped by a guy there.
    <br>They took him to jail. He was crying.
    <br>We wanted to kill him.
    <br>Is that why he spent two weeks in the prison?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Who did it?
    <br>We did it.
    <br>OK, what is in The Synagogue Church Of All Nations that is attacking both your master - lucifer, and you people?
    <br>You are asking me as if you don't know.
    <br>Can't you see fire everywhere here? Can't you see that I am feeling hot? Can't you see that?
    <br>You people are delivering people, up and down. Why?
    <br>What is wrong in delivering people?
    <br>Why do you deliver them? They belong to us.
    <br>So, you people have been sending them? Those demons?
    <br>Those people belong to... We want them to serve us. They should work for us.
    <br>What is your work?
    <br>We want to kill them. We want to destroy them. It is our happiness.
    <br>We sent him this Facebook request.
    <br>He refused it and he printed the photo.
    <br>He printed the photo, he wanted to show it to the prophet.
    <br>We invited him on Facebook with this one.
    <br>These are our agents. We wanted him to accept the request.
    <br>Then he would die.
    <br>What is this all about?
    <br>That is our sign. Can't you see?
    <br>Your what?
    <br>That is your what?
    <br>Our sign.
    <br>That is one of the signs of our kingdom.
    <br>Which kingdom?
    <br>Darkness. Lucifer.
    <br>What is this all about?
    <br>That is the triple six.
    <br>What does it mean, and how do you use this figure?
    <br>When we send those pictures and you accept it, you become a member of our kingdom.
    <br>We would start communicating with you.
    <br>Then, we get hold of you and when we do, you can also become a member.
    <br>You will serve us. You will also go and get people for our kingdom.
    <br>So, whoever sees this thing, that person is in trouble.
    <br>What kind of trouble?
    <br>If that person is not careful, we get hold of his soul.
    <br>Then, that is it for him, he will work for our kingdom.
    <br>What "caliber" of people have you initiated?
    <br>We especially focus on the youth.
    <br>Youth?
    <br>Yes, young men and women.
    <br>Why do you choose to focus...
    <br>They like Facebook.
    <br>They like what?
    <br>Facebook. They like Facebook, so we invite them.
    <br>There are different ways. We get hold of them through that.
    <br>A lot of them, they register on Facebook.
    <br>They have their photos there.
    <br>We go through them and those that are the called ones, we attack them.
    <br>How do you attack them?
    <br>Sometimes we place our ladies to invite them; they become friends with them.
    <br>You place your ladies?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What kind of ladies? How? Explain!
    <br>They are beautiful.
    <br>Beautiful ones?
    <br>We have beautiful ladies in our kingdom and very handsome guys.
    <br>We send them out there to attack people.
    <br>Yes. If you become friends with them on Facebook, you are in trouble.
    <br>They communicate with you. Even this guy, he doesn't know; he's confused.
    <br>We got his number and he doesn't know where we got his number from.
    <br>We called him at night, threatened him, told him he would die and not see 2013
    <br>because he made up his mind he would only serve God.
    <br>He wanted to come to The SCOAN. We called his number.
    <br>How did you get his number?
    <br>Through one of our girls.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you capture this youth that always have their pictures on Facebook, they want to go to the internet,
    <br>what will happen to their career, to their destiny, to their future?
    <br>They are destroyed. Nothing will work for them. Can't you see this guy?
    <br>Before he came here, he sold all his stuff.
    <br>They didn't even pay him the money.
    <br>A lot of people had promised to assist him before he came here.
    <br>He had to sell all his stuff, his laptop, his iPad, everything.
    <br>His car, he sold even the car - they didn't pay him.
    <br>He struggled. When he got to the airport, he got arrested.
    <br>He was taken to court. He paid a lot of money.
    <br>He booked a ticket for Saturday, he arrived there - they told him that his ticket had been sold again.
    <br>Yes, this is what we do.
    <br>Look at these products.
    <br>They are all the same thing; it's just that we show up in different ways.
    <br>We wanted to frustrate this guy…
    <br>Look at the pictures. Whose pictures are these and from where?
    <br>That is the sign. That is lucifer.
    <br>Please, allow me to go.
    <br>You have explained what you did to this man.
    <br>I'm talking about the youth. You have succeeded in getting to them on Facebook through these means.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What is happening to their career?
    <br>Their career is damaged. They will struggle; they will work.
    <br>Even at school, they will not perform. When they finish, there is no job waiting for them.
    <br>They will be struggling. When they struggle, we are very happy. That is how we enjoy.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What will happen to their marriage, if at all they want to get married? What will happen to it?
    <br>They will not get married. Through these things - as I said, to some of them we assign ladies.
    <br>When they sleep, they are finished. This guy is not married.
    <br>When they do what?
    <br>When they sleep with them.
    <br>What will happen to them?
    <br>Then that is it; that is the end. They will not get married unless they are delivered.
    <br>That is why we don’t want you to be delivering people here.
    <br>That is why you don't want...
    <br>Yes. We don't want you guys to be delivering them.
    <br>Why?
    <br>When you deliver them, their life will change. They will start doing well.
    <br>This guy is supposed to be a millionaire.
    <br>He was supposed to have a congregation and serve God. We stopped everything.
    <br>Sometimes we appear to him as a snake.
    <br>We have so many ways we operate.
    <br>OK. What will happen to the spiritual life of those youths, that have this?
    <br>Those that are the called ones are our targets. They will not serve God anymore.
    <br>They will be just sleeping around, committing fornication and adultery.
    <br>They will be drinking and smoking. That will be their life and that is our joy.
    <br>That is your what?
    <br>Our joy.
    <br>Your joy?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Why?
    <br>That is it. That is what we like. Yes.
    <br>How many people all around the world have you managed to put into your kingdom through this method?
    <br>Millions. You can never imagine. They are many.
    <br>How many demonic powers do you possess in this body?
    <br>So many powers.
    <br>Your end has come.
    <br>No.
    <br>Your end has come.
    <br>I don't want to go!
    <br>This guy belongs to me.
    <br>Didn't I tell you that he belongs to me?
    <br>He can't serve God!
    <br>Since he was born, we have been threatening his life up to now.
    <br>Do you see this scar?
    <br>He was sick. They took him to a witch doctor.
    <br>Once they cut it, we put a spirit inside.
    <br>And you today want to deliver him. For what?
    <br>When Jesus says "Yes", no one can say "No".
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out of this body, you principalities.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire all over your body!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, you demon!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you now?
    <br>I'm fine, thank you.
    <br>You just stood up from the floor.
    <br>Yes. I don't know what happened.
    <br>You said you were an agent of lucifer.
    <br>No. I can't be an agent. I am a servant of God.
    <br>You are who?
    <br>I am a servant of God, I can't be an agent for lucifer.
    <br>No, I can't do that. I love God, I love Jesus.
    <br>And you said that you destroyed yourself, you made yourself to sell your properties.
    <br>I love myself.
    <br>What has happened to your properties?
    <br>I sold my properties to get money to come here.
    <br>I wanted to come and get delivered, but I never had money.
    <br>I have been working but nothing works for me, so I had to sell my things.
    <br>And I was not even paid for some of the things that I sold.
    <br>We saw that you brought out something from your pocket.
    <br>You had something in your pocket before, and you brought it out.
    <br>Check, whether you can see it around. What is this?
    <br>These are requests that I received on Facebook.
    <br>Those are the pictures. I did never accept them.
    <br>Bring it, sir. Take it.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Somebody did what?
    <br>Someone sent me these photos on Facebook.
    <br>He sent a Facebook request to be my friend.
    <br>But I don't know the person.
    <br>That person lives close to my house and I thought this person knows me.
    <br>I clicked on the photo to check who it was before accepting the Facebook request.
    <br>When I clicked it, these photos appeared.
    <br>When I saw the photos, I got sick for two days. I stayed in bed. I couldn't wake up.
    <br>I used to dream very bad dreams with snakes.
    <br>I was hearing voices telling me that I would die.
    <br>It became worse since I saw the photo.
    <br>Sometimes I could not sleep at night.
    <br>Sometimes I see members of my family who died some years ago
    <br>I printed these photos so that I could show them to the prophet.
    <br>These are the photos.
    <br>That demon that destroyed your life, your career and everything about you is out of you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>So, you are delivered.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I will serve you forever. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Fabio Adjavon. I'm a citizen of Ghana but I reside in South Africa.
    <br>Sir, tell us briefly about your background, about the kind of the family you are from
    <br>that enabled this evil spirit to enter you from the very beginning.
    <br>I'm from a family of idol worshippers and I grew up experiencing spiritual attacks from time to time,
    <br>and nothing I did worked out.
    <br>Tell us more about the kind of dreams you were having as you were growing up.
    <br>I used to see a snake attacking me in the dream,
    <br>sometimes even physically I would walk around and see a snake in front of me,
    <br>getting ready to attack me.
    <br>I saw dead people in my dreams.
    <br>Sometimes I would physically see a very big spider walking on my wall,
    <br>which would all of a sudden disappear.
    <br>These are some of the dreams and attacks that I experienced.
    <br>Growing up I realised that I could see a woman having sex with me.
    <br>It disturbed my life. When I woke up, I was very weak and I could not pray any more, I could not do anything.
    <br>Tell us more how it affected your career and your zeal to be a Christian, to serve God.
    <br>I didn't succeed in anything I did. Spiritually I became "very down".
    <br>I could not fulfill my purpose on earth and it disturbed me a lot.
    <br>Right now we want to learn from you the area of Facebook,
    <br>how this demon actually entered your life through Facebook.
    <br>Just tell us more about how that happened.
    <br>Were you using Facebook before? What were you using it for? And how did this incident occur?
    <br>Yes. I have an account on Facebook.
    <br>I usually use it for loading some photos and for leaving messages, the Word of God, and so forth.
    <br>When I was arranging my documents to come here, that is when I received this Facebook request
    <br>from someone that I do not know.
    <br>Tell us more; how did the request come in, and what then happened.
    <br>I went to Facebook like any other day to check my messages and other things,
    <br>then I realised that someone had sent me a Facebook request.
    <br>I didn't know the person.
    <br>The request indicated that the person was from the area, where a lot of people from our church live.
    <br>I initially thought that person knew me, and it was one of our church members.
    <br>You didn't know the person'' name, but you suspected that it was someone you knew very well.
    <br>What did you do then?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>On the profile picture there were about four people sitting down and drinking.
    <br>I clicked on that photo first. That photo was a cartoon, not an image of a real person.
    <br>I couldn't see their faces.
    <br>I clicked on the photo and started browsing the profile to see who that person was.
    <br>That is when I came across these photos.
    <br>Tell us - the moment you saw these pictures what happened to you?
    <br>It was like something entered me when I clicked on the photo, and I started going through them.
    <br>It was like I received something that entered me.
    <br>I started to feel very "down", very sick.
    <br>You mean to say that the moment you just saw these pictures on your computer,
    <br>you felt something physically enter inside of you.
    <br>Exactly. I was very shocked. I never expected such a thing.
    <br>I felt like something entered me.
    <br>So, you mean that you never even accepted the request. You just clicked on the picture to see more,
    <br>and that is how something entered inside of you.
    <br>Exactly. I never accepted.
    <br>I receive so many Facebook requests that I don't accept.
    <br>If I don't know the person, I don't accept.
    <br>Even if I know the person, I am still very careful.
    <br>So, I never accepted that one. I just clicked on the photo to make sure I know the person before accepting.
    <br>So, the moment you felt something enter into inside of you - tell us what happened after that.
    <br>Then I started to feel very "down", and very sick.
    <br>I remember I couldn't do anything for the rest of that day.
    <br>I became very sick, I stayed in bed for two days.
    <br>What did you begin to see in your dreams after you witnessed these pictures on Facebook?
    <br>As I said, I used to receive bad dreams, with snakes and so forth.
    <br>After seeing these pictures it became much worse and frequent.
    <br>Even in the afternoon - while taking a rest, I would see my family members who died many years ago
    <br>coming to me, doing the "normal" stuff - they cook, I eat.
    <br>I saw my grandmother telling me that she has come to take me away.
    <br>After that, the following night...
    <br>Even during the sickness I had to use the Anointing Water
    <br>and call some of my friends to come and pray for me.
    <br>That is what helped me to wake up the next day.
    <br>The following night I received a phone call around 1:40am when I was sleeping.
    <br>When I picked up the call, I heard something like a conference - I could hear the person
    <br>and other voices in the background as well.
    <br>The person was using a microphone to speak, saying that they have been assigned to destroy my life,
    <br>so I would not see 2013.
    <br>They asked if it wasn't my decision to serve God.
    <br>You mean, that physically, after you saw these pictures, you received a phone call?
    <br>Was the number hidden, or you saw the number of the call?
    <br>It was a "no-number" call.
    <br>You said that the first thing you heard was like someone speaking into a microphone and
    <br>and there were many people there.
    <br>People in the background, like sort of a conference.
    <br>What exactly did they tell you on the phone?
    <br>This person said that they have been assigned to destroy my life, and that they were agents of lucifer
    <br>and they wanted to kill me because I had a calling to serve God, and they didn't want that.
    <br>People of God - we can really learn a lot from our brother's experience.
    <br>This is a physical thing that happened to him.
    <br>He received a phone call from an unknown number after seeing these pictures,
    <br>after clicking on the request of Facebook, and physically agents of lucifer called him and said
    <br>that they had been assigned to destroy him, and he would not see the year 2013.
    <br>Tell us brother, what happened from that point on.
    <br>It became very challenging, and at that point I was actually planning to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Things became much worse for me.
    <br>I managed to get my document ready.
    <br>I had to sell all my stuff to raise that money to come.
    <br>During my struggle, sometimes I had a dream, seeing the prophet calling me to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>that is where I needed to go to get my deliverance.
    <br>After having seen the photos, people promised to assist me financially.
    <br>When the time came, no one was picking my calls, or they said they didn't have money to assist me.
    <br>So, I had to sell everything.
    <br>When I got to the airport...
    <br>Before I left, I was involved in two serious accidents.
    <br>If not by the grace of God...
    <br>I usually have the Anointing Water and the Sticker by my side, any time I'm driving around.
    <br>It was just by the grace of God that nothing happened to me.
    <br>When I got to the airport, the immigration officer told me that I should stay aside.
    <br>I asked, "What did I do?"
    <br>Then he told me that I have to spend four years in jail.
    <br>I said that he hadn't even checked my document.
    <br>Then they went through my document and said that the document was fake, not original.
    <br>So they detained me.
    <br>Later on they took me to prison.
    <br>The first voice I heard in the jail was, "Commit suicide".
    <br>I started thinking about that.
    <br>I looked around, but there was nothing for me to use to commit suicide.
    <br>Another thought that came to my mind was to ask my friend to buy acid, and put it in a coke,
    <br>and bring it to me, so I could drink it to die.
    <br>The next voice that I heard was telling me to run away from the prison, which I knew was impossible.
    <br>The third voice was telling me not to do any of those things.
    <br>It became a challenge.
    <br>I thought of actually committing suicide, but it was difficult for me to find the means to do it.
    <br>In the process I just saw the image of the prophet when he was falsely accused and arrested.
    <br>Seeing the prophet encouraged me.
    <br>I told myself, "As the prophet became the greatest man on earth after being accused and arrested,
    <br>there would be no need for me to commit suicide".
    <br>That is how the image of suicide came out of my mind.
    <br>You saw the image of Prophet T.B. Joshua in your mind, and recalled how he too was wrongly imprisoned,
    <br>and that strengthened you not to commit suicide while you were in prison.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>How did you come out of prison and finally made your way to The SCOAN?
    <br>I had to call my friends and they had to come and talk to a lawyer.
    <br>I was taken to court and they arranged that.
    <br>They collected a lot of money and I was released.
    <br>They said I could not travel directly to Nigeria, so I had to go to my country first.
    <br>I travelled down to Ghana.
    <br>I booked my ticket to come here on Saturday.
    <br>My luggage was missing at the airport.
    <br>I looked for the luggage, but I couldn't find it.
    <br>When asked, people at the airport said they did not know where my luggage was.
    <br>I had to wait till the following day.
    <br>I went back to the airport the following day.
    <br>They said that my luggage was still not there.
    <br>I was roaming and looking around at the airport and I found the luggage.
    <br>When I booked my bus to come here, they said that my ticked was re-booked
    <br>and given to another person without any reason.
    <br>So, it was a struggle even to come here from Ghana.
    <br>We can really understand from our brother how satan was trying every means possible
    <br>to stop our brother from coming here.
    <br>This is why Prophet T.B. Joshua often says that the greatest mistake satan has made
    <br>is allowing you to come here to The SCOAN.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that upon all of the odds stacked against him, today our brother is here,
    <br>a living testimony that he made it and he is here today to share his testimony.
    <br>Sir, tell us - when you finally came what happened when Wise Man Christopher prayed for you.
    <br>I thank God for that. I am very excited.
    <br>I was touched by Wise Man Christopher, whom I saw few months ago delivering me in The SCOAN.
    <br>I even told my friend that it would be Wise Man Christopher that would deliver me in The SCOAN.
    <br>You mean you saw it in your dream?
    <br>I saw him in my dream a few months ago when I was preparing to come here.
    <br>I told all my friends that I had a dream of coming to The SCOAN
    <br>and Wise Man Christopher delivered me.
    <br>That was exactly what happened when I came here.
    <br>When he touched me, I only felt fire.
    <br>Even before the wise men came out and started praying for people, when the prophet came,
    <br>while he was preaching, it was fire all over my body.
    <br>The fire was coming from the ground.
    <br>It entered my legs and climbed up my body.
    <br>I felt very uncomfortable.
    <br>It was surprising to me.
    <br>I couldn't believe that while the man of God was preaching, I was feeling fire.
    <br>Wise Man Christopher touched me.
    <br>I started to feel heat, and that is when the spirit started manifesting.
    <br>That is the only thing I can remember, but I thank God for my deliverance.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell us, sir, what happened after your deliverance.
    <br>After my deliverance I slept very peacefully. I feel very light.
    <br>I am very happy now.
    <br>I know that the hindrance that stopped me from fulfilling my purpose on earth has been removed from my way.
    <br>But there is something that surprised me most.
    <br>On Monday I was called to come back here for references, to go through the testimony and so forth.
    <br>I had to go back to Facebook.
    <br>I wanted to write down the name of the person who invited me, the exact date and time of the request.
    <br>To my surprise - the request vanished from my Facebook account.
    <br>I couldn't believe it.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, I think you need to explain this, so the people can understand what you are saying.
    <br>You mean that the pictures and the request that were given to you vanished after the deliverance?
    <br>Yes. Technically that is not possible. I don't know how that happened.
    <br>I have a lot of Facebook requests that I have never accepted.
    <br>The list of those requests with various dates and pictures is still there.
    <br>When I went through that again, I could not find the request from this person, or the photos.
    <br>I was very surprised; I had to call my friend to come and witness this.
    <br>Even today; there are things that are happening in the spirit.
    <br>This is just spiritual, and I thank God for this miracle.
    <br>I will never, never, never go back to that life.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Sir, how have you been sleeping since your deliverance?
    <br>You said before you were always tormented in your dreams. How are you sleeping right now?
    <br>I have not received any phone call so far.
    <br>I have not had any bad dream. I sleep very peacefully.
    <br>Now I have dreams of great things God is preparing for me to do.
    <br>I have registered a business.
    <br>In the very first week the business was doing well.
    <br>After a few weeks people started calling me, saying that they didn't want to be partners anymore.
    <br>Those people are now calling me back, asking to be my business partner - I thank God for that.
    <br>You mean that after your deliverance you have been receiving phone calls from people
    <br>wanting to partner with you?
    <br>I was delivered on Sunday. On Monday morning I started receiving phone calls.
    <br>Even though I was not in South Africa, people were looking for me through my partners
    <br>asking to join my business. I thank God for that.
    <br>What can we say but "Thank You, Jesus Christ"!
    <br>Sir, right now, I think you are in the position to advise the world, especially the youth,
    <br>the young people who are watching Emmanuel TV right now,
    <br>and who have listened to this testimony and this experience.
    <br>What do you want to tell them about the dangers of the internet and especially Facebook?
    <br>My advice to people, especially the youth,
    <br>because I know very well that they spend much of their time on Facebook.
    <br>They wake up with Facebook and go back to sleep with Facebook,
    <br>instead of waking up with prayer and going back to bed with prayer.
    <br>They rather wake up with Facebook, and they sleep with Facebook.
    <br>I want to tell them, Facebook is not important for your life,
    <br>Facebook will not help you to achieve your purpose,
    <br>Facebook will not help you to succeed in life,
    <br>Facebook will not help you to do well in school, it will rather cause your downfall.
    <br>My personal advice to everybody is, Facebook is not important, don't do Facebook.
    <br>Unless you only follow the prophet and Emmanuel TV on Facebook, there is no need for you to go there.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We rejoice with our brother and we thank God Almighty for what He has done in his life
    <br>through setting him free from these demonic spirits, and we believe that
    <br>youth around the world and people present here have taken their lesson from this experience in life.
    <br>We just want to encourage you brother; the best is yet to come.
    <br>Continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life, and we believe you will be back here
    <br>with more wonderful testimonies in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The prophet said that if anybody wants to open a Facebook account, this person should first of all
    <br>go onto his page and pray together with him, before that person can open his own Facebook account.
    <br>And those who already have Facebook; if you want to maintain your Facebook account,
    <br>the prophet said that you should first of all go on his page and pray with him,
    <br>before you go and check your Facebook.
    <br>Internet is affecting a lot of people.
    <br>I know people that have been destroyed through Facebook.
    <br>It all starts with a Facebook request and friendship but with time you realize that you start dating the person,
    <br>you start involving in sex and everything, and the devil is destroying a lot of people through that.
    <br>I also want to advise those who go to the internet in general.
    <br>You might come across a link that will tell you - maybe you are doing a research...
    <br>When you click on that link, you will be surprised to see other things, like pornography and so forth.
    <br>I am really, really appealing and pleading with the whole world; you have to be very very careful.
    <br>Be prayerful when you go on the internet and to Facebook.
    <br>There is something that people are doing, which is like a "style" that everybody is doing now:
    <br>"online dating" - it is something that the devil is using to destroy people.
    <br>You see their adverts everywhere.
    <br>Even on posts you see people saying, "If you want to date, if you want to have a boyfriend or girlfriend,
    <br>you should go to this website".
    <br>I am appealing to you, your life will be destroyed.
    <br>Thank you very much.
