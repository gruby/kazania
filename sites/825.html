    <br>Israel's Minister Of Tourism Yariv Levin Meets With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Welcome to Israel, welcome to Jerusalem - although I know it is almost a second home for you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>And of course, welcome to the Ministry of Tourism.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I must say I have read about your activities and first of all, I want to say, thank you.
    <br>I appreciate it very much -
    <br>seeing you as a prominent leader, saying things loud and clear and doing that on the ground.
    <br>Those who follow the truth in hard times, I believe that in the end, are remembered as real leaders.
    <br>We saw it in the past, in history and that's what will happen also regarding the times we live in.
    <br>I personally believe that for us in Israel, because we live here in the Holy Land,
    <br>making it possible for every believer, whether Jew, Christian or Muslim, to come here
    <br>to visit the holy places, to pray and do everything they want to do and feel safe while doing it,
    <br>is something that is not just an obligation but even a big right that we have
    <br>to make sure that all of that happens.
    <br>I do believe that making the possibility for people to come here and see things with their own eyes
    <br>and feel it, is much more than the ability to visit a place but rather an experience for life.
    <br>I believe that everyone who comes here goes back to their family and people as a different and better person.
    <br>In that aspect, I think that if we succeed in making it easier for more people to come here,
    <br>it’s not only a question of tourism but I believe it’s also a question of really giving people
    <br>something that is an added value for life and something that will fulfill our obligation.
    <br>Also, we are lucky to be in a place where we are able to do that.
    <br>In that aspect, I do believe in the potential of what we can do regarding tourism from Africa
    <br>as a whole and especially from Nigeria.
    <br>I believe that we are very far from exploiting the potential.
    <br>I believe we can do much more in order to do that.
    <br>We now have a much better cooperation with the Ministry of Interior regarding visas.
    <br>I'm really willing and at your disposal in order to hear what you expect from us.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Minister, I want to thank you for this great honour, for taking your time.
    <br>So, thank you very much.
    <br>I have been coming to Israel for many years; this is my home.
    <br>We have several travel agencies in Israel that are specialised in pilgrimage packages
    <br>that enable people to really visit the most important places and do it in a meaningful way.
    <br>I want to thank you, Minister, for your time and for your love.
    <br>We are at your disposal and we are really willing to help.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We see it as a really important initiative.
    <br>Please, don't hesitate to contact us to ask if there is anything you think that we can help with.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Just tell us.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Israel's Minister Of Tourism Yariv Levin Meets With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I'm Yariv Levin, Minister of Tourism for the state of Israel.
    <br>I just had a very important meeting with Prophet Joshua.
    <br>It was an honour for me to meet him.
    <br>So, the Holy Land is waiting for you. 
    <br>Israel is waiting for you.
    <br>Please come here.
    <br>You are most welcome.
    <br>I'm Yariv Levin, Minister of Tourism for the state of Israel.
    <br>I call on you: Please, continue watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>It's worth it.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Meets With The Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau In Jerusalem
    <br>It's a pleasure.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau Hosts Prophet T.B. Joshua In Jerusalem
    <br>This is your home so we are brothers.
    <br>This is my home; I'm happy to meet you.
    <br>But I have the privilege that I was born here.
    <br>Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau Hosts Prophet T.B. Joshua In Jerusalem
    <br>I'm happy that you are giving us your time.
    <br>You feel that this is your home.
    <br>You know, in the Bible you can find this sentence.
    <br>This is a person and person who was born in this place.
    <br>Our sages explain why the Bible says a person and person.
    <br>Why twice?
    <br>The explanation is, first a person who was born here and the second is to be spiritually born here.
    <br>Someone whose dream to feel at home here is exactly the same as someone who was born here.
    <br>What the Bible is trying to say there is someone who is born physically and spiritually.
    <br>There is also one who is born spiritually.
    <br>I am one of the children born spiritually but I was not born physically.
    <br>You were born physically and spiritually.
    <br>Because of that, I need your words because I know a lot of people who were born here but only physically.
    <br>They forgot about being born spiritually.
    <br>Because of that, your warm words help me to explain to people how important it is to be born here spiritually.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>This is a very, very nice place.
    <br>It is my privilege to see you here and hear your words.
    <br>I want to tell you one more sentence.
    <br>This is a place where you can find all kinds of people.
    <br>I was in South Africa last year and they asked me about the differences between people -
    <br>if someone is a Muslim, Christian, Jew, black or white.
    <br>I told them they could see, in every hospital in Israel, in every department in Israel, you can see
    <br>among the people who treat and the people who need treatment,
    <br>you can see beds near each other and they help each other.
    <br>It doesn’t depend on whether you are a Jew or Muslim, Jew or Gentile.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>What is unique about the hospitals in Israel
    <br>is that we take care of everybody and everybody takes care of everybody.
    <br>You can have nurses and doctors that are Arabs or Christians or Jews
    <br>and you can have people who are ill that are also Arabs, Christians or Jews.
    <br>That is the meaning of Holy Land.
    <br>Yes, this is the Holy Land.
    <br>The Holy Land accepts everyone.
    <br>Everyone wants to be holy.
    <br>In the Bible, you can find another sentence that says, all of us are children of God.
    <br>Because of that, I and you, he and she – all of us are children of one Father.
    <br>So, this is why I told you we are brothers.
    <br>Now, you can see it in the Bible.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Twenty-eight years ago, someone from Israel went to Nigeria to build telecommunications.
    <br>His flight was involved in an accident and all 143 people died.
    <br>The plane crashed.
    <br>His wife was in the city I was in as Chief Rabbi.
    <br>She called me and asked me what to do.
    <br>She didn’t know exactly if her husband had died or not.
    <br>She didn’t know whether she should mourn yet or not.
    <br>The details – she didn’t know.
    <br>I sent someone from Israel to your country.
    <br>He went there and found a taxi driver.
    <br>I have remembered the name for 28 years.
    <br>We spoke; he was the taxi driver that took him to the airport.
    <br>We spoke about it; I took all the details and told her I was sure that he had died.
    <br>Because of that, she could get married to another man.
    <br>It was something amazing; 28 years ago, communication was not as easy as today.
    <br>That is Nigeria, they love foreigners.
    <br>When they see that you are not a Nigerian but from another country, they are ready to die for you.
    <br>I felt it; it was such a warm help.
    <br>I am very thankful for it.
    <br>Chief Rabbi Of Israel, Rabbi David Lau Hosts Prophet T.B. Joshua In Jerusalem
    <br>For me as a Chief Rabbi of Israel, it is a very great pleasure to meet you,
    <br>to see a lot of things you have done, giving all of your life and your power
    <br>and thinking about other people in the world - it is very nice to see it.
