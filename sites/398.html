  <p>    
    <br>Let's just look at the Bible for 2 to 3 minutes.
    <br>Hebrew 11:6
    <br>"But without faith it is impossible to please Him,
    <br>for he who comes to God must believe..."
    <br>Take note of that; he who comes - they are talking to you.
    <br>The Bible here is talking to you.
    <br>"he who comes to God must believe that He is,
    <br>and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him".
    <br>Are you with me there?
    <br>"But without faith it is impossible to please God,
    <br>for he who comes to God must believe that He is,
    <br>and that He is a rewarder."
    <br>Take note of that and underline that.
    <br>Wonderful. I like that.
    <br>"for he who comes to God must believe that He is,
    <br>and that He is a rewarder".
    <br>He is to give you an answer, a solution and the reward.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let someone say, "Speak faith".
    <br>Faith must first be in the heart before there can be an acceptance confession.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Faith must first be in the heart before there can be an acceptance confession.
    <br>Faith must first be in the heart before you can say,
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, be healed".
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, be delivered".
    <br>"In Jesus' name. Amen."
    <br>If you hear someone who is saying that genuinely,
    <br>he or she must first have faith - must first be in the heart
    <br>before he or she can say, "In the name of Jesus Christ".
    <br>If not, you are only calling the name in vain.
    <br>Remember what the Bible says, "You shall not call the name of the Lord in vain".
    <br>Many times we talk about the issue of faith; in that Book of Romans 10:8-10.
    <br>The Word of faith is in two places:
    <br>In our heart to believe and in our mouth to confess.
    <br>This means, confession is part of salvation just as believing is part of salvation.
    <br>Can you see why faith must first be in the heart before there can be an acceptance confession?
    <br>In the Book of Romans 6:2...
    <br>The words you speak determine the life you enjoy.
    <br>The reason is that, the mouth is the rewinder, revealer of the belief in our heart.
    <br>When I stand here and say, "Be delivered, in Jesus' name"
    <br>whereas I am not connected to God, the Deliverer, I am deceiving myself.
    <br>Oftentimes, I will face destruction; my words will remain idle, meaningless.
    <br>Like seven sons of Sceva - destructive.
    <br>"Be healed!" and I'm not connected to the Healer - who will now heal?
    <br>But look at what the Healer, Deliverer is saying here.
    <br>The Deliverer is saying here that without faith, it is impossible to please Me.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The Deliverer, Healer is saying here that without faith, it is impossible to please Him.
    <br>That is what the Deliverer is saying.
    <br>Who is the Deliverer? Jesus Christ.
    <br>Who is the Healer? Jesus Christ.
    <br>Who is the Provider? Jesus Christ
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>You are here to meet the Deliverer, Healer.
    <br>But the Deliverer is saying here that it is impossible to please or hear Him...
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Can you see where our problems are coming from?
    <br>The church people today - these are the challenges we are having.
    <br>You say, "Ah, this man is a church-man, pastor, this, that..."
    <br>To be a pastor is a name, honour, degree;
    <br>you can bear that name, you can decide to be a pastor, prophet, believer, bishop, whatever.
    <br>God has His own name.
    <br>God has His own standard.
    <br>Faith must first be in the heart before there can be an acceptance confession,
    <br>an acceptance talk, an acceptance look at Him.
    <br>Faith must first be in the heart; faith is of man's heart, spirit.
    <br>Remember, in the Scripture, heart and spirit are the same.
    <br>When you refer to heart, you refer to spirit.
    <br>We are not talking of biology, science.
    <br>Science is a different thing when you speak of heart, spirit.
    <br>But here, I come back home; things of the Spirit - heart, spirit.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Let me just put it this way:
    <br>If you examine your life, you will find out how much faith you have.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[If you examine your life, you will find out how much faith you have.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[If you examine your life, you will find out how much faith you have.]
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>If you examine your life, you will find out how much you please God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[If you examine your life, you will find out how much you please God.]
    <br>Look at me; where am I going?
    <br>If I examine my life...
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our lives.
    <br>In my walking...
    <br>If I examine my life, I would know how much faith I have in my walking,
    <br>how much I please God in my walking.
    <br>Where am I going?
    <br>Am I going to God?
    <br>If you examine your life, you will find out how much faith you have,
    <br>in your talking, looking, dress, sitting, chat with people...
    <br>Just name them.
    <br>If you examine your life.
    <br>Examine your life.
    <br>As long as you have faith, you have God.
    <br>Am I talking to you?
    <br>Take this word.
    <br>If you examine your life, you will find out how much faith you have.
    <br>In your talking...
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things.
    <br>As you are looking at me: how much faith - you can find out.
    <br>If you have that absolute faith, you would know who is talking here.
    <br>Without faith, you will still see that boy called T.B. Joshua,
    <br>that looks like a staff in your working place.
    <br>Your staff could be a cleaner, any employee...
    <br>"He looks like this guy that..."
    <br>Without faith, you will begin to trace this boy - where he is coming from, his biological background,
    <br>his brothers, his sisters, "Look at him - is it not the guy?"
    <br>If you examine your life, you will find out how much faith you have.
    <br>in your looking - how much faith you have.
    <br>Without faith you can't see anything, you only hear me talking,
    <br>but you will not know by what authority I'm talking.
    <br>You will just see me as a philosopher, teacher, or one of the pharisees or sadducees,
    <br>and you will begin to examine the content of my language.
    <br>You will not even look at the content but you will begin to examine the grammatical aspect of it,
    <br>the accent and the structure of the grammar.
    <br>The "graphic looking" cannot give you the real picture.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You know what I mean - "graphic picture".
    <br>Just "graphic picture" will not take you to where I want to take you.
    <br>Only God knows who is serving Him.
    <br>Only God knows man's heart.
    <br>You listen to the confession of people, "I'm a Christian, pastor, prophet"
    <br>but only God knows who is real.
    <br>SPEAK FAITH
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>SPEAK FAITH! Short Sermon - TB Joshua
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Right now, open your heart; Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Ask Jesus to give you a hearing heart.
    <br>Give me a hearing heart.
    <br>Give me a hearing faith.
    <br>There are many faiths that could not hear.
    <br>God, give me a hearing faith, a hearing heart.
    <br>Remember, faith is of man's heart.
    <br>Give me a hearing heart, a hearing faith.
    <br>I want to hear, Lord, I want to know Your opinion about myself.
    <br>I want to know You
    <br>I want to see Your face
    <br>I want to know You more
    <br>I want to touch You
    <br>I want to hear Your voice
