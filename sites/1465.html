    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>The Bible says, 'Thank You' is the response of a happy heart.
    <br>Are you happy today?
    <br>Are you really?
    <br>Let Heaven hear you!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What makes you happy?
    <br>Jesus is alive. You believe so?
    <br>So rejoice! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You may be seated in His presence.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We rejoice because there is a promise of God in our lives.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is a promise of God in your life".
    <br>So whatever you are passing through, look over it.
    <br>Say, "Nothing outside God's control can happen to me".
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Brethren, sometimes we want to be strong but we find ourselves being weak.
    <br>We want to be successful but we fail repeatedly.
    <br>We want to be courageous - stout-hearted but we find ourselves overcome with fear.
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says that we are in the end times -
    <br>the manifestation of the spirit of fear.
    <br>Fear.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, fear is not my portion".
    <br>Say, "You fear, I will not allow you to take over my heart".
    <br>Being faithful to God does not eliminate trouble and adversities.
    <br>Many biblical characters had moments of doubt and fear.
    <br>There were situations in their lives that challenged their faith in a unique, special way.
    <br>They experienced situations that caused them sometimes to doubt God's ability to help them.
    <br>The best saints see the need sometimes to receive help from above to make their faith stronger.
    <br>In Genesis 15:6, Abraham believed but still he asked for a sign to make his faith stronger.
    <br>Gideon believed in the Book of Judges 6:36-37
    <br>but still he asked from Heaven for a sign to strengthen his faith.
    <br>There are situations and there is a situation.
    <br>Say, "My situation is not like others'.
    <br>My situation is not meant to destroy me but to make me stronger".
    <br>Therefore, don't fear that situation.
    <br>Because the Bible says, 'Take heart'.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, take heart".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Fear not, take heart - remember the words of Jesus".
    <br>Let's open our Bibles to the Book of John 16:32.
    <br>"Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered,
    <br>each to his own, and will leave Me alone.
    <br>And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
    <br>These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace.
    <br>In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."
    <br>Say, "Jesus has overcome for me".
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Do you believe Jesus has overcome for you?
    <br>Therefore, don't allow fear to overwhelm you.
    <br>What is fear?
    <br>Fear traps our souls.
    <br>Fear ensnares our souls and handcuffs our lives.
    <br>It imprisons us.
    <br>Fear paralyses our potential.
    <br>How?
    <br>Because fear weakens our determination and willpower
    <br>and then prevents us from taking important decisions that can change our lives.
    <br>That's why Moses said to his people in the Book of Exodus 14:13,
    <br>he told them, "Don't be afraid".
    <br>Whatever is your giant, whatever is your Red Sea, in the silence of your heart, don't be afraid.
    <br>Jesus knows. He is alive.
    <br>In other words, overcome fear because fear is a thief of faith and hope.
    <br>Any time you are in a place of hope, a moment of breakthrough,
    <br>any time you are in a place where God wants you to be,
    <br>satan will do everything to dislodge you from that place.
    <br>To live a life of fear is to live a life of destruction.
    <br>Any time you give room, give place to fear in your heart, any time you nurture that fear,
    <br>you are indirectly making it easy for the devil
    <br>because fear gives power to the devil to strike, kill, steal and destroy.
    <br>Millions, thousands, many people today have surrendered to their fears
    <br>while their hearts are still dreaming for a miracle.
    <br>Pressure and tension have led many to lose hope, abandon their post,
    <br>abandon their businesses, abandon their marriages, abandon their prospective successes
    <br>because they have concluded that there is no hope, no way, no future for them.
    <br>What situation are you passing through that can create pressure, tension and fear?
    <br>The man of God says that fear is not wrong; fear is not a problem.
    <br>It is when you harbour or nurture that fear and let it grow in your heart,
    <br>within you, that it becomes a problem.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't give room to that fear in your heart.
    <br>Resist it and cast it out.
    <br>Resist it and come to Jesus. He is faithful".
    <br>We are not called upon to look within us to see how much faith we have.
    <br>We are called to come to Jesus, sit at Jesus' feet,
    <br>to take the faith, the strength that He has promised to give -
    <br>the strength, the faith you need.
    <br>When your situations are unyielding to your prayers,
    <br>it is in your own interest to live above that fear
    <br>by leaving that situation to God, to the One who says,
    <br>'Come to me and I will give you rest'.
    <br>Faith enables the believer to overcome fear -
    <br>that fear that robs the faithless of God's blessings in their lives.
    <br>As you are sitting down, listen to your heart.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, listen to your heart".
    <br>Listen to the voice of Jesus in the inner room saying to you, 'Take heart; I am aware'.
    <br>Say, "Take heart - this is the voice of Jesus".
    <br>My heart hear the voice of God
    <br>My heart hear the voice of the Holy Spirit
    <br>Let there be freedom
    <br>Let there be rest
    <br>In my heart
    <br>In my mind
    <br>And in my soul
    <br>In Jesus' name
    <br>Let there be freedom
    <br>Let there be rest
    <br>In my heart
    <br>In my mind
    <br>And in my soul
    <br>In Jesus' name
    <br>Let there be freedom
    <br>Let there be rest in my heart
    <br>Oh oh oh
    <br>Let there be freedom
    <br>Let there be rest
    <br>In my heart
    <br>In my mind
    <br>And in my soul
    <br>In Jesus' name
    <br>Let there be freedom
    <br>Let there be rest in my heart
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Remember our message: Take heart.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, take heart".
    <br>Whatever situation you are passing through does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>God does not mind doubt,
    <br>as long as we are seeking answers from God in the midst of that doubt.
    <br>That situation does not make you faithless people.
    <br>Say, "I am not a faithless person.
    <br>I am a faith man; I am a faith woman.
    <br>Therefore, I will not give up".
    <br>To the people of the world, affliction, trouble, poverty, setback
    <br>are a poison that kills man's happiness and zeal to move forward.
    <br>But to the people of God, this serves as a tonic, a driving force to move forward.
    <br>Affliction, situations, troubles all serve in moving us closer to God.
    <br>Your situation is not a natural one but an extraordinary one.
    <br>As you move closer to God, you receive strength to trust Him and your faith will grow even more.
    <br>I mean, as you are closer to God you learn to derive,
    <br>to receive Heavenly resources and your faith will grow stronger and stronger.
    <br>The Scripture says, positive examples are tremendous motivators for success.
    <br>Let someone say, "Positive examples are tremendous motivators for success".
    <br>Good success.
    <br>But negative examples are tremendous examples that lead to failure.
    <br>Therefore, let us walk in the footsteps of those who have set good examples
    <br>so we can learn from them and our faith will grow stronger.
    <br>Let's take the case of Simon Peter we all know.
    <br>In that Book of Luke 5, Peter was faced with an uncommon challenge
    <br>of setback, failure, disappointment, poverty at the seaside.
    <br>He learnt to draw on Christ's resources and he overcame.
    <br>Peter simply said to the Lord, "I have toiled hard; Lord, this is failure.
    <br>Lord, this is setback. Lord, this is barrenness.
    <br>But at Your Word, I will lay down my net".
    <br>Say, "Lord, at Your Word, my spirit will act on Your Word".
    <br>Peter acted on the Word of God and received a breakthrough
    <br>and failure became a thing of the past.
    <br>When Peter wanted again to make a difference in his life,
    <br>as a fisherman to walk on the water,
    <br>Peter simply said to the Lord in Matthew 14:28,
    <br>"Lord, if you are the one, ask me to come on the water and I will come".
    <br>Jesus said to him, "Come".
    <br>Peter came out of the boat, walked on the water and walked towards Jesus.
    <br>What can we learn from this?
    <br>If today you carry God's instruction in your life,
    <br>that instruction will carry you to unreachable places,
    <br>that instruction will take you to breakthrough, to healing, to deliverance, to success.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>If you are ready, begin to rejoice and say, "Thank You, Jesus, for my breakthrough".
    <br>Are you ready to receive your healing, your deliverance, your breakthrough?
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus if you are ready.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Brethren, finally, the way through your fear, that situation, that tremendous discouragement
    <br>that came from the pain of the past, see it as a lesson.
    <br>Turn it around because life is a learning experience.
    <br>What is the lesson?
    <br>We must learn to deal with fear and doubt at its earliest stage.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, you must learn to deal with fear and doubt at the earliest stage
    <br>by finding out what God says about it".
    <br>That situation that causes fear, I say to you, "Cheer up! Take heart!"
    <br>I have good news because the Bible says,
    <br>we have a Helper from above, the Holy Spirit, who will help us to defeat that giant.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit begins to speak to our lives, changes are beginning.
    <br>When the Spirit suggests to you what happens next,
    <br>that fear, that doubt will disappear.
    <br>When He begins to speak to your heart, changes are beginning - from doubt to faith,
    <br>from fear to boldness, from failure to good success.
    <br>So reach out to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, come to His presence".
    <br>Are you in His presence?
    <br>As you are in His presence, don't allow your heart to be fearful,
    <br>don't allow your heart to condemn you;
    <br>rather, let your heart be in perfect fellowship with the living Word.
    <br>Believe His Word, trust His Word, be bold in its truth.
    <br>Confess what God says in your situation.
    <br>Live in His Word and let His Word live in you and victory will be as sure as the rising of the sun.
    <br>Say, "My victory has come. My breakthrough has come.
    <br>Lord, thank You.
    <br>I am blessed, I am healed, I am delivered".
    <br>May God bless His Word.
