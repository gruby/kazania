    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen right now.
    <br>Be engaged with God.
    <br>I want to pray with the viewers right now
    <br>Those who are under the influence of my voice.
    <br>Whatever situation that you are in,
    <br>I say, be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever situation that you are in -
    <br>it is not the will of God.
    <br>Be released, in theme of Jesus!
    <br>It is the will of God to release you and I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Listen, the voice of God says -
    <br>you are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The voice of God says -
    <br>you are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes, I will not blame you, that you are doubting.
    <br>Your doubt will not change anything.
    <br>Viewers, listen!  You are doubting that;
    <br>‘Is that how I will be released? I have suffered so much’.
    <br>I say, you are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your doubt will not change anything.
    <br>Be released!
    <br>Whatever the situation – it could be hardship, setback, depression, affliction,
    <br>I say, be released in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being released.
    <br>A prophet says he can see you being released.
    <br>Viewers, what does this mean to you?
    <br>I want to hear from you, what does this mean to you?
    <br>What does it mean to you?
    <br>If you honour a prophet because he is a prophet of God,
    <br>you will receive his reward.
    <br>A prophet says right now, you are released.
    <br>What does it mean to you?
    <br>You are delivered.
    <br>What does it mean to you?
    <br>You are healed.
    <br>What does it mean to you?
    <br>You are free.
    <br>What does it mean to you?
    <br>You are saved.
    <br>What does it mean to you?
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Yes!
    <br>That is the confession God wants to hear -
    <br>that when a prophet says you are released, what does it mean to you?
    <br>You say, you are released. That is all.
    <br>From your mouth, faith comes.
    <br>'Yes, yes' - comes faith.
    <br>'No, no' - comes doubt.
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God as you send your testimony
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip that you just have watched
