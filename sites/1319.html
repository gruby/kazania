    <br>NIGERIAN ELECTIONS MAY LIKELY BE...
    <br>As we continue to pray for the upcoming Nigerian Presidential Elections,
    <br>let us remember the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua on Sunday February 10, 2019, as quoted in an article:
    <br>"The Nigerian election may likely be postponed because of many challenges.
    <br>In whatever way, God is in control...
    <br>God will not allow anything to happen to Nigeria.
    <br>It is just a cloud that is hovering. Be calm.
    <br>The nation has a strong bond with God. Nigeria will stand.
    <br>Those who will cause trouble will see trouble and those who will cause peace will see peace
    <br>but the nation Nigeria will stand."
    <br>T.B. Joshua
