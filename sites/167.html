    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On the 29th of December 2013,
    <br>during a live Sunday Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied about the nation, Russia.
    <br>He revealed that their leader would face opposition
    <br>and that an impending war was coming their way.
    <br>In light of the prophecy,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua also prompted everyone around the world
    <br>to pray for the nation of Russia.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray.
    <br>Pray for the nation, Russia.
    <br>Because I am seeing war is coming against them.
    <br>I don't know where the war comes from.
    <br>Their leader will face opposition.
    <br>Pray for them.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
