    <br>Man of God, help me, I have cancer.
    <br>I have taken one but I have to take one more.
    <br>Man of God, please help my husband. He has cancer.
    <br>He has taken one; it is remaining one and the doctors said it is fifty – fifty.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mr Grytli.
    <br>This is prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Watch as this man moves against his will,
    <br>there is a force busy at work setting him free, in the mighty, all-powerful name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Geir Grytli, I am from Norway.
    <br>The woman beside me is my lovely wife - Princess.
    <br>In 2016 I got cancer in my thyroids.
    <br>There was a lot of pain and I couldn't do anything.
    <br>We were watching Emmanuel TV all the time because operation is not a solution.
    <br>Having watched Emmanuel TV, we decided to come here, to The SCOAN.
    <br>We came here in June 2017.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me - I fell down and I felt cold.
    <br>When we came back to Norway, we ministered the Morning Water in the mornings and evenings.
    <br>After some time I went back to the hospital; they took an ultrasound and they couldn't find any cancer.
    <br>I'm free, I'm strong.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ; put your hands beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>Trust in God; He will do it.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You heard it - trust in God, He will do it.
    <br>No other one can do it, except Jesus Christ.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Princess Grytli, I come from Norway.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>My husband got cancer in 2016.
    <br>It was so severe that he couldn't do anything at all.
    <br>The doctor said it was fifty - fifty.
    <br>I said that it was not a lottery to leave his body to "fifty - fifty".
    <br>In 2017, we came to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for my husband; he fell down, he felt cold.
    <br>After we went back to Norway, we ministered the Morning Water in the mornings and evenings.
    <br>After we ministered it, my husband went back to the hospital;
    <br>they checked him and said there was no more cancer.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Here is the medical report that I had a cancer of 2,7 centimetres in my thyroids,
    <br>and here is the confirmation from my doctor that there is no more cancer in my body.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>My word of advice to all viewers and those here in the auditorium is to trust in God.
    <br>When you trust in God, all other things will be added to you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
