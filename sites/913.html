    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua with Children in South Korea
    <br>This is T.B. Joshua on one of his visits to South Korea enjoying the company of children.
    <br>They're singing and happy to be in the presence of someone they have seen God using mightily.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua with Children in South Korea
    <br>This endearing scene reminds us of Matthew 19:14
    <br>where Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me.
    <br>Don't stop them for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these".

    <br>Be an obedient child.
    <br>Obey your father and your mum.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua with Children in South Korea.
    <br>Black!
    <br>Look at the action of this little boy.
    <br>He rubs Prophet T.B. Joshua's skin as if his colour would rub off.
    <br>We are uniquely created on the outside, but in our hearts we are made to be like Jesus.
    <br>I love you!
    <br>FUNNY: Little Children With TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Even at the dinner table, the children are reluctant to leave the presence of the man of God.
    <br>They continue to play with him and admire what makes him different which is the grace of God.
