  <p>    
    <br>I see you have a heart for God.
    <br>You love Jesus. You're always in the church.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Praising God but there is an evil spirit in your life.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>A demon possesses you.
    <br>That is why I've come here.
    <br>Before now, you keep asking yourself, "What kind of spirit is this?"
    <br>But this time, he appeared to you face to face, physically.
    <br>You can see physically that a demon is using your body as a dwelling place.
    <br>In fact, it chased me from the US to here.
    <br>It kept attacking me in the dream, even when I'm not sleeping,
    <br>like wrestling with me.
    <br>And I came here to...
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>It's out.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>It has destroyed you, destroyed your family, destroyed everything, your career.
    <br>You're an elder in the church.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you see demon? Demon is a foolish thing
    <br>and it's now tormenting an elder in the church.
    <br>But it's over now. It will never come on you again.
    <br>Seriously, I was thinking, when I get back to the US,
    <br>I'm not going back to that church again.
    <br>The church I was going to was a redeemed church.
    <br>I don't know where this demon came from.
    <br>As an elder, don't leave the church. Stay in the church.
    <br>- The demon will not torment you again.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Continue your services of God there, don't leave the place.
    <br>I'll be your friend, your partner in prayer.
    <br>Amen! Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Sir, we welcome you to The Synagogue Church once again, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you please tell us your name and where you come from.
    <br>My name is Moses Adeola.
    <br>I'm from Osun State, Nigeria but I came from the US because I'm based in the US.
    <br>Tell us the message of prophecy you've received from the anointed man of God.
    <br>During the worship, the man of God called me out and said
    <br>that I have a heart for God,
    <br>I've never missed church,
    <br>that I'm always in the church praising God - in fact, that is true -
    <br>and that I'm an elder in the church but I have this demonic attack all the time.
    <br>This is true, I confirm it.
    <br>As a matter of fact, before I left the US, that was part of the problem.
    <br>The demonic attack comes all the time, it lives inside me.
    <br>I see you have a heart for God. You love Jesus.
    <br>You are always in the church.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Praising God but there is an evil spirit in your life.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>A demon possesses you.
    <br>That is why I have come here.
    <br>Before now, you keep asking yourself, "What kind of spirit is this?"
    <br>But this time, he appeared to you face to face, physically.
    <br>You can see physically that a demon is using your body as a dwelling place.
    <br>In fact, before I left, I had to struggle with it,
    <br>like we were struggling with one another.
    <br>I had to beat him out and run out.
    <br>It was like the demon was chasing me,
    <br>even to come to Nigeria, because when I was in the plane, I still saw it
    <br>and when I arrived in Nigeria, I still saw it.
    <br>So, I was confused about that.
    <br>Sir, you mean, all what the man of God said about you is true.
    <br>That is, you have a heart for God, and you love God,
    <br>you're always in the church praising God but there's a demon that lives inside you,
    <br>that uses your body and it even manifests to you in the physical.
    <br>Can you tell us, how did the man of God put the prophecy?
    <br>Yes, what the man of God said was true.
    <br>I love God.
    <br>I like to worship.
    <br>He said that this demonic attack had possessed me,
    <br>a demon lives inside me, my body.
    <br>It is true because I see it even when I'm not sleeping.
    <br>So, what the man of God said was true.
    <br>Okay, do you believe now that this prophecy you have received today
    <br>has put an end to this common calamity of human life that you've been experiencing?
    <br>Yes, I believe. The man of God prayed for me and the Lord revealed it to him.
    <br>I believe that I have overcome it.
    <br>I have the victory now and I thank God for it.
    <br>Amen. And the man of God also told you in the prophecy
    <br>that you should not leave the church
    <br>since you have decided to remain in God's presence to praise Him -
    <br>you should not allow this problem to make you to leave the presence of God.
    <br>Is that true for your life?
    <br>Yes, that is true because the demonic attack was so much.
    <br>I didn't know where it was coming from
    <br>so I said, when I get back to the US, I'm going to quit going to that church
    <br>and then go to the Lord and pray, to see where the Lord will lead me.
    <br>But the man of God advised me to stay there and not to quit the church.
    <br>You are an elder in the church.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you see demon? A demon is a foolish thing
    <br>and it's now tormenting an elder in the church.
    <br>But it's over now. It will never come on you again.
    <br>Seriously, I was thinking, when I get back to the US,
    <br>I'm not going back to that church again.
    <br>The church I was going to was a redeemed church.
    <br>I don't know where this demon came from.
    <br>As an elder, don't leave the church, stay in the church.
    <br>- The demon will not torment you again.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Continue your services of God there, don't leave the place.
    <br>I'll be your friend, your partner in prayer.
    <br>I agreed with him.
    <br>To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for this wonderful revelation and deliverance
    <br>that you have received today through the message of prophecy.
    <br>And we want to encourage you as a believer in Christ Jesus
    <br>to maintain your stand in Christ Jesus and make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Remember that sometimes foolish things may happen
    <br>to strengthen our desire and our determination to follow our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>As you make the Word of God the standard for your life today,
    <br>this wonderful deliverance you've received through the prophecy
    <br>will be permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen, I receive that.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Prophecy Continues
