    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>Brother, where is your wife?
    <br>Because, it is terrible, the affection is dead.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>As beautiful as she is - when you people are together in a closet,
    <br>it's like a man to man together.
    <br>Exactly, Man of God.
    <br>You'll just be looking at a beautiful person but you don't have affection again.
    <br>That is it, Man of God.
    <br>This is the problem in the house.
    <br>Exactly, Man of God.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Mr. Nnamdi Edozie. I'm from Anambra State.
    <br>The person here is my wife.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave to me was hundred percent true.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God came to me and asked me where my wife was.
    <br>And I said that this is my wife.
    <br>He said that there is no affection, that I don't have any affection for her.
    <br>He said that as beautiful as she is, there is no affection.
    <br>And I said, "Yes". Exactly - the prophecy is correct, hundred percent correct.
    <br>There was no affection between me and her.
    <br>In the house, she would fight me, do all sorts of things to me and beat me.
    <br>At times, I would sleep in the toilet until daybreak. Before I knew it, the day had broken.
    <br>At times, I would leave her when she was pursuing me and
    <br>I would go to another room.
    <br>If you would go where we are living, you'd see all the keys are broken.
    <br>She would break the key there, meet me and start fighting with me.
    <br>I don't want to touch her, I don't want to beat her, because I know she's...
    <br>So she used to beat you?
    <br>She used to beat me.
    <br>I even cook for her, wash her clothes, do all sorts of things because
    <br>when I entered my house, I would see everywhere was scattered.
    <br>I had to be doing things for myself. The two maids we had, she drove them away.
    <br>So it's only me and her that are living there.
    <br>I want to really thank you for your endurance.
    <br>And, assume you beat her back, a day like this would not come.
    <br>Assume you beat her back, you would not be talking today.
    <br>We would not talk of reconciliation today.
    <br>She beat you.
    <br>And each time she beats you, you run?
    <br>Yes, Man of God. I usually ran because I did not want to touch her.
    <br>I knew she was not herself.
    <br>She was just like a husband in the house.
    <br>I found out one thing.
    <br>Whenever I dreamt, I usually saw the spiritual husband in my dreams.
    <br>He always turned me to be a servant.
    <br>I would be cleaning the house, washing his vehicle
    <br>and he would be busy making love with my wife.
    <br>At the end of the day, after everything, I would be the one to ask my wife how everything was
    <br>and if she had enjoyed it.
    <br>And she would tell me that it was very okay. She enjoyed everything.
    <br>Even the man's manhood was very big.
    <br>Thank you. Today is the last day.
    <br>Uncle, this marriage is from God. And, the deliverance will take place.
    <br>You and your wife will be delivered.
    <br>You will now become a man, and your wife will become a woman.
    <br>You said you are the woman, and your wife is the man?
    <br>She is the husband at home
    <br>because I can't tell her anything that she will do. No no no, she can't do that.
    <br>The way she would do it - she takes my money and buy things.
    <br>Like today - she was asking me for money to do her hair, saying that
    <br>she would not come to the church without making her hair.
    <br>The last hair do she had was about 13,000 naira.
    <br>Ok, it's alright. It's alright
    <br>My brother, don't worry.
    <br>Don't worry. She will be a mother after the deliverance.
    <br>Don't worry. Everything will be over now.
    <br>She is a mother.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This happened this morning. We were about to come to the church...
    <br>This morning?
    <br>Yes, Sir.
    <br>We were about to come to the church and
    <br>she said she could not come with her hair to the church. She couldn't do that.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>Accident?
    <br>She seized me.
    <br>She beat you?
    <br>She beat me and tore my dress.
    <br>This morning?
    <br>This morning.
    <br>Ok, it's alright, it's alright.
    <br>Don't show us the rest. Put it inside the bag.
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>I will not allow you to talk.
    <br>I will not allow you to talk. Don't worry.
    <br>I know the worst has happened. This woman - she will be your wife after the deliverance.
    <br>You will see her on her knees, giving you kiss. All what she has done to you...
    <br>You will enjoy this one. She is a good woman.
    <br>She is not the one doing all this.
    <br>The more you say it, the more "hehehe". I don't want that "hehehe".
    <br>No. Don't worry.
    <br>The rest...
    <br>I have many other things to say. There are so many.
    <br>Oh, my God!
    <br>As she is now, please, cameraman, focus on her face.
    <br>This face you see now, there is no kind of makeup...
    <br>Ok, camera, leave the face.
    <br>Ok, go and wait for me.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Is it a crime to put makeup?
    <br>Go and sit down. Put her near the air conditioning. Because makeup needs air conditioning.
    <br>Please, he should sit down. Come.
    <br>Come and sit here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The makeup makes her look beautiful.
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>I want to tell you, this is a marriage from God.
    <br>I will prove it to you people with the power of God,
    <br>the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Following the instruction of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the husband and wife returned the next day for deliverance during the Monday Live Service.
    <br>Let's see what happened.
    <br>At the Synagogue Church of all Nations,
    <br>God Almighty moves mightily in the midst of the congregation,
    <br>using Wise Man Christopher as a medium to bring healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings.
    <br>Remember, satan comes to kill, steal and destroy.
    <br>But Jesus Christ came that we may have abundant life.
    <br>As Wise Man Christopher touches this lady,
    <br>the evil spirit inside of her immediately reacts to the spirit-filled touch
    <br>and begins to manifest.
    <br>Let's see how she was delivered, in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Speak out. Who are you?
    <br>Giant.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>I want to kill her.
    <br>What have you done to her husband and marriage?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>This is trouble for me.
    <br>You are welcome, sir.
    <br>Who is this man to you?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>You are welcome, sir.
    <br>She is my wife. We came together.
    <br>No, I don't know him.
    <br>What have you done to this marriage?
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>For what?
    <br>I want to kill her.
    <br>Why do you want to kill her?
    <br>I want to kill her and kill that stupid man.
    <br>Why?
    <br>She is for me.
    <br>I love her so much.
    <br>You cannot do anything.
    <br>This man, if not for the love, they would have been dead by now.
    <br>I did it.
    <br>How? What happened?
    <br>What did you plan to do?
    <br>Accident. I want to kill them. It's too much, they are disturbing me.
    <br>I am a giant.
    <br>From where?
    <br>River.
    <br>These are my trucks that have had a series of accidents.
    <br>Even when we were coming, we had a terrible accident.
    <br>We were discharged from the hospital before we came here.
    <br>I was with her in my Jeep and just like that,
    <br>a car crashed into us head on.
    <br>We were unconscious.
    <br>My chest hit the steering wheel and I thought I was dead.
    <br>I knew there was danger. That's why I ran to The SCOAN to find a solution.
    <br>These are my trucks.
    <br>This one crashed into a commissioner's house, and I repaired the house.
    <br>This one killed 14 passengers.
    <br>This one crashed into the deputy commissioner's house and destroyed it.
    <br>I was the one that repaired it.
    <br>There were other ones. Another crashed into a river. It was a fuel tanker.
    <br>They took me to court and I had to pay approximately 2 million naira.
    <br>All the time, there would be accidents with both my personal and business vehicles.
    <br>All of them would have accidents.
    <br>What other evil things have you done?
    <br>Wait, let us have an agreement.
    <br>I don't talk much.
    <br>You are in the presence of God....
    <br>No, let us do it gently.
    <br>...where you cannot hide, speak!
    <br>I am mighty.
    <br>There is no child.
    <br>For what?
    <br>Who caused it?
    <br>I did.
    <br>Why?
    <br>She is my own.
    <br>For what? Why would I leave her?
    <br>Before she married this person, it was not easy.
    <br>I wanted to push her to somebody who would kill her - an occultic man
    <br>who would use her for rituals.
    <br>It was her mother.
    <br>That woman advised this person to take my wife.
    <br>How did you enter this body?
    <br>I entered her when she was in the market.
    <br>She used to be in her mother's shop, doing things and working well.
    <br>For what? Why should she be working well?
    <br>I don't want her to progress. I don't want her to shine.
    <br>That's why I entered her to destroy.
    <br>I will kill this man.
    <br>You cannot kill me.
    <br>Get away from me.
    <br>Right now, you are a stranger. Get out!
    <br>Come out of this body, you demon!
    <br>Move out!
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>All over your body, fire in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Every part of your body!
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for her freedom.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' Name.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Your are set free.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, ma?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine, sir.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Can you see this man?
    <br>Baby, I am sorry.
    <br>I have forgiven you.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Who is this man to you?
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>He's who?
    <br>My husband.
    <br>You can see that the evil spirit being in her that spoke as the giant man,
    <br>has been cast out by Jesus.
    <br>Her past is over, and your past life of setback, accidents and the rest is also over.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! We are free.
    <br>By the special grace of God, my mentor, Prophet T.B Joshua spoke to you yesterday
    <br>and, for one reason or the other, there was not enough time
    <br>because he was talking to a lot of people.
    <br>Now, you have been given the grace to explain what the demon in the life of your wife
    <br>was doing to you and your career.
    <br>My name is Mr Nnamdi Edozie. I'm from Anambra State.
    <br>I don't know how to start to thank God because what I have seen today
    <br>is what about 21 native doctors couldn't do.
    <br>It has happened here today.
    <br>Before we got married, we dated each other.
    <br>The very day we pronounced the date of our wedding is when everything started.
    <br>She was in the market one day and was rushed to the hospital because she was fainting.
    <br>I thought it was a very minor issue. I called my friend and we went to church.
    <br>When we got to the church, they said that her mother was the cause
    <br>but I said, "No, it cannot be her mother because her mother handed her over to me.
    <br>There is no way that it can be her mother".
    <br>That's how we started. We moved from one church to the other.
    <br>There is no church we have not attended.
    <br>I then thought that this could be something diabolical.
    <br>I then started going from one native doctor to the other.
    <br>Even when I went to native doctors,
    <br>I would ask them where I could find the highest native doctor
    <br>and they would take me to another native doctor.
    <br>That is how I started going everywhere.
    <br>You came yesterday and you were given a prophecy.
    <br>Do you remember what the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, told you?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>How has your wife's character and attitude been like?
    <br>Her character caused that there was no peace in the house at all.
    <br>She didn't want to see me.
    <br>When I entered the house, she would do all sorts of things, beat me.
    <br>She can't cook.
    <br>For her hair, she would tell me that she wanted to buy a N60,000 wig.
    <br>I would say, "No, how can you buy a N60,000 wig?"
    <br>She would want to spend money recklessly but I would say, "No".
    <br>Whenever she needed that kind of money and I refused, it caused a fight;
    <br>she would fight me.
    <br>If you went into the house, everything would be untidy.
    <br>She couldn't even wash her clothes. I was the one doing the housework.
    <br>I would wash my clothes and hers and even wash her underwear.
    <br>There are so many things...
    <br>If she managed to cook,
    <br>either the salt would be too much or the pepper would be too much.
    <br>So I told her, "Stop cooking, I will do it myself".
    <br>It was going like that.
    <br>Everything started turning upside down.
    <br>I'm into transport business.
    <br>My vehicles started having problems, getting into one accident and another.
    <br>The business was not moving normally.
    <br>I knew there was something behind it.
    <br>Usually in my dreams, I would see this man.
    <br>Even sometimes, I would tell him to come out and let us fight.
    <br>He was a very tall, giant man.
    <br>When we slept, early in the morning, if I looked at her eyes,
    <br>a kind of sparkle would sparkle in my eyes.
    <br>I used to see her spiritual husband in a very big house with a vehicle.
    <br>He turned me into a servant there.
    <br>I used to wash the vehicle and sweep the house.
    <br>The spiritual husband would come and take my wife with pride,
    <br>enter the house and make love with my wife.
    <br>Afterwards, he wouldhug her, laugh and come out.
    <br>Then, I would ask my wife what happened.
    <br>My wife said that the whole thing was sweet, that it was not small
    <br>and that she enjoyed everything.
    <br>I was helpless; there was nothing I could do.
    <br>I would have the same dreams.
    <br>The spiritual husband would come to me also in my dreams.
    <br>He told me, "Look, my friend, forget about your manhood;
    <br>I have taken it".
    <br>At daybreak, I thought it was an ordinary dream.
    <br>I found out that my manhood was not working very well.
    <br>That was how life was going.
    <br>At times, she would say that she wanted to die.
    <br>She would take a knife and try to stab herself.
    <br>I would be the one that would stop her.
    <br>I couldn't go anywhere because I believed that one day she would kill herself.
    <br>Even when she was sleeping, I would watch her and every ten minutes, I would wake her.
    <br>After she opened her eyes, I would tell her to continue sleeping.
    <br>That was how I had been keeping vigil over her.
    <br>That's how the whole thing started.
    <br>You can't tell her something and see that she does it. No!
    <br>She would like to command you. She would like to tell you what to do.
    <br>At times I used to ask her, "Are you the one who married me or am I the one that married you?"
    <br>She would say that she was the one that owned the house.
    <br>Glory be to God, you came yesterday
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua, my mentor, spoke to you
    <br>and told you exactly what you have explained to us now.
    <br>The grace of God in his life has put an end to this trouble.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! We are delivered!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Nothing and no one on this earth except God could have reconciled this marriage
    <br>because the reconciliation demands deliverance.
    <br>The man is the one kissing, not the woman.
    <br>The man is the one kneeling down, not the woman.
    <br>So, all that we were saying while she was standing,
    <br>she was just looking at me - "What is happening here."
    <br>That day, I said to the whole world, after the deliverance,
    <br>the woman would be the one to be on her knees, taking the responsibility of a woman,
    <br>and the man would also take the responsibility of a man
    <br>and the whole thing would be reconciled. I said it to the whole world.
    <br>So, now I know the whole world is waiting.
    <br>What happened now? That is what we want to hear.
    <br>Secondly, the lesson you have to learn here is that God will not prepare a free woman,
    <br>a woman that is so free from everything for you to marry,
    <br>or a man that is free for you to marry.
    <br>You have to do some adjustments, jobs.
    <br>It is like when you buy a car.
    <br>You can't just take a car and say this is a new car and begin to use it.
    <br>You still have some jobs to do.
    <br>In the life of man, in the life of woman.
    <br>If you know this medically, so you should know this spiritually.
    <br>Medically, when you meet a woman you want to marry, or a woman wants to marry a man,
    <br>the first thing you'll want to know is the medical state of the man
    <br>and the medical state of the woman.
    <br>No matter whether the woman says that she is a pastor or born-again or whatever,
    <br>you need to know the spiritual state of the woman, and
    <br>the woman needs to know the spiritual state of the man.
    <br>But we have failed to do that.
    <br>We only face one side of life.
    <br>We are interested in the medical state of a man before marrying him
    <br>and the medical state of the woman before marrying her.
    <br>That is the only thing that appeals to us in all marriages in the world.
    <br>That is why there is trouble in marriages today.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with us, nobody can be against us at all.
    <br>My name is Mr Nnamdi Dozie.
    <br>The person beside me here is my lovely wife.
    <br>I don't know how to say this, how to qualify this.
    <br>I'm short of words for what God has done in my life.
    <br>Let me start from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>People call him pastor T.B. Joshua,
    <br>other people call him Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That man that you are seeing there is more than a prophet.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He is God sent.
    <br>God sent him to set the world free,
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>to deliver the world and set people out of their bondages.
    <br>He did it in my life.
    <br>I have testified, I have seen and I have conquered.
    <br>I have my reason for saying this.
    <br>My reason is that, something that almost 50 churches could not do,
    <br>almost 21 herbalists could not do, he did it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have gone to many churches, there was nowhere I had not gone to.
    <br>Even at times they would ask me to sow a seed that would provoke God.
    <br>They said that when God was provoked, my problem would be over.
    <br>However, the more I sowed the seed, the more my problem got tougher.
    <br>I then decided that this was not a church issue. Maybe it was a diabolical thing.
    <br>That is how I started going to herbalists.
    <br>There was no herbalist in the east that I had not gone to looking for a solution.
    <br>There was no place I had not gone to searching for a solution.
    <br>It got to the extent that wherever I went, I would be asking people,
    <br>where I could get the highest herbalist that would solve my problem
    <br>and they always took me to them.
    <br>There was even one herbalist that was called a name which meant
    <br>somebody who could solve all problems.
    <br>I went there.
    <br>The herbalist called his oracle, called my name. I didn't tell him my name.
    <br>He called my name and said, "Welcome".
    <br>He told me all my problems.
    <br>He told me there was a solution.
    <br>He charged me a lot of money and I paid.
    <br>Yet, everything remained the same. There was no solution.
    <br>It happened that this oracle started telling me many things
    <br>like there was a woman I befriended who was behind everything.
    <br>I believed because the oracle could call my name and tell me what brought me.
    <br>I had every confidence in this oracle and I started chasing shadows.
    <br>Everything this oracle said, I did it - bring such and such amount of money.
    <br>To the extent that I deposited my vehicle in an attempt to pay the balance.
    <br>Still, the problem remained the same.
    <br>It is by the grace of God that I got the cable and searched for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That is how I saw what is happening here.
    <br>When I saw what was happening here, I started to imagine that I should come.
    <br>When I was coming here, I was coming to test.
    <br>I was coming to test whether it would work out.
    <br>There is no place I had not gone to.
    <br>There was something that happened that I want to narrate.
    <br>During the prophecy, we were sitting on our seats.
    <br>The man of God came and prophesied to somebody who was behind my wife
    <br>and then prophesied to somebody who was behind me.
    <br>He even prophesied to somebody in front of me.
    <br>He also prophesied to somebody behind me.
    <br>When you are prophesied to, the ushers always take you out.
    <br>It happened that I was the only one left on the seat with my wife.
    <br>I told her in slang that it seemed the spiritual husband had covered the man of God's face.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Please, take it back again because I could not hear very well.
    <br>You said, when I entered and began to prophesy - start from there.
    <br>When you prophesied to somebody in front of me, behind me and beside my wife.
    <br>It was only my wife left.
    <br>I believed that my problem was more than of those you prophesied to.
    <br>That was when I told my wife that it seemed
    <br>the spiritual husband had covered man of God's eyes so that he could not see us.
    <br>My wife said, "Yes, it seems so. Don't worry.
    <br>When we leave, we will go to that witchdoctor we haven't been to yet".
    <br>Inside the church?
    <br>Yes, that was what we were saying in our minds.
    <br>While we were discussing this, it was as if the man of God heard
    <br>what we were discussing and turned back.
    <br>When he turned back, he passed my seat again, reversed and passed me again.
    <br>You know when you are expecting something from someone,
    <br>you would watch his every movement.
    <br>Then, as he passed, it was as if there was an electric shock that hit him
    <br>and he stopped, turned to me and said, "Brother, can I talk to you?"
    <br>I said to myself that this man must be a powerful man.
    <br>That was when he gave me the prophecy
    <br>and went directly to tell me what was happening in my life.
    <br>My people have a parable that says: Anything you wear on your hand
    <br>you do not need a mirror to look at it.
    <br>As you can see, my wife is a wife to me now.
    <br>This was a woman that did not want to see me.
    <br>This was a woman who, after cooking, she would walk to the dustbin and pour it away.
    <br>Since when? For how many years?
    <br>About two and a half years.
    <br>You people have been living in this trouble?
    <br>Exactly, Man of God.
    <br>This was a woman that would never be happy.
    <br>When she looked in the mirror, she would tell me that she saw another person.
    <br>This was a woman that would tell me something was telling her
    <br>to remove all her clothers and begin to run naked.
    <br>This was a woman that wherever she was, she was not happy.
    <br>She would bring out a knife and want to kill herself.
    <br>I would be the one to take the knife from her. I would be the one guiding her.
    <br>A lot happened in our lives.
    <br>The only thing that has happened now is that she has changed my name to "Baby Boy".
    <br>Before then, she didn't use to call my name: "Who is this? I beg, get out."
    <br>That was how she had been behaving at home.
    <br>But now she always calls out, "Baby boy, where are you?"
    <br>Madam, since that Sunday, what has happened in your vision, your dreams, when you sleep?
    <br>Tell us - what happened, and the man too - what happened?
    <br>After my deliverance, I dreamt and saw the spiritual husband coming to take me
    <br>and use me for pepper soup.
    <br>Then, they said they have caught him.
    <br>They cut him into pieces and used him for pepper soup. So, he died.
    <br>In the past, he used to appear to you, sometimes physically when you were alone?
    <br>Yes, before my deliverance, I used to see him.
    <br>When I was alone, it would be as if someone was telling me something.
    <br>If I looked behind me, I would not see anybody.
    <br>It would be as if somebody passed me. I would not see anybody.
    <br>I would always be afraid. I couldn't sleep alone.
    <br>Even in the house, it couldn't be alone there.
    <br>Before my deliverance, I could never be happy - no matter what I had.
    <br>It didn't matter what I ate or where I was taken; it only added to the anger.
    <br>If I was dressing up, I would look in the mirror and I would not be seeing myself.
    <br>It would be as if I was looking at a hundred year old person.
    <br>I would ask my husband if he saw me or saw what I was seeing too.
    <br>He would say it was me, but I would say that I did not see myself.
    <br>The more I said this, the more angry I became.
    <br>There was no affection at all. There was nothing he did that made me happy.
    <br>Even if he did something that would make me happy, that is when I would be more angry.
    <br>But now, I am the happiest woman on earth.
    <br>Wow, did you listen to that? There is affection now?
    <br>Yes, Man of God. I love my husband so much now.
    <br>I learnt you are calling him "baby".
    <br>Yes, he's my "Baby Boy".
    <br>You have listened to that?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Oh, this is a lesson to everyone,
    <br>to everyone of us.
    <br>Because of all this, there is marry and re-marry.
    <br>Assume they were able to have a child, they would have a child that is possessed.
    <br>It's better that they have no child.
    <br>Now, they're delivered they can have a child.
    <br>I did not mention the aspect of affection.
    <br>The affection now is wonderful, just like an electric shock.
    <br>We don't want that electric shock to shock you inside the church. So, glory be to God!
    <br>You have spent so much.
    <br>Can you quantify how much you have spent in the process of delivering this lady?
    <br>Man of God, I can't estimate this.
    <br>But in terms of physical cash, I think I have spent more than 15 million naira.
    <br>I am not talking in terms of my trucks and other vehicles that had accidents and spoilt.
    <br>How many vehicles had accidents?
    <br>It was three trucks plus my personal jeep, making four all together.
    <br>Which involved 15 people?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Died.
    <br>My advice to couples all over the world especially people that are passing through so many things,
    <br>they are supposed to learn from my experience
    <br>that there is nothing God cannot do.
    <br>70 percent of homes today are broken because of this spiritual attack.
    <br>When you, because of evil spirit, divorce a woman and end the marriage,
    <br>satan will arrange the most beautiful woman with your desired appearance somewhere -
    <br>waiting for you.
    <br>The next woman you marry will have a greater evil spirit than the one you left.
    <br>You cannot escape it. If you because of evil spirit ... we don't divorce because of evil spirit.
    <br>If you do that, it's dangerous.
    <br>Very dangerous. Are you talking of suicide?
    <br>This is the spirit that makes people commit suicide.
    <br>People like her.
    <br>If this deliverance had not happened at this time,
    <br>she would have hung herself or made use of a drug - sleep and not wake up.
    <br>Hang or stab herself.
    <br>Or jump inside the sea.
    <br>Or run onto the express road.
    <br>That is the spirit of suicide. It would tell you, "Go and do this" and that is it.
    <br>The same spirit in her can affect the husband to do the same, to commit suicide
    <br>because frustration would lead the husband to do that.
    <br>So, can you imagine the suicide that is going on all over the world today? All over.
    <br>You can't because of frustration, commit suicide - but the spirit of frustration.
    <br>You can't because of poverty, commit suicide - the spirit of poverty.
    <br>You can't because of sickness die - the spirit of sickness.
    <br>Are you with me? If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
