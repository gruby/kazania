  <p>    
    <br>My name is Godwin Sunday Udoh.
    <br>I am a member of Full Gospel Church of God.
    <br>This is my daughter, Blessing Godwin Sunday.
    <br>This is my first daughter, Mary Godwin Sunday.
    <br>This is my third child, Abraham Godwin Sunday.
    <br>This is my last born baby, Elijah Godwin Sunday.
    <br>I had a very dark incident last year on Wednesday 16 September 2015.
    <br>I was coming from church with my family
    <br>I was riding a motorised tricycle, known as 'keke maruwa', to ljegun bus stop.
    <br>On getting to ljegun bus stop, I saw a group of policemen at the check point.
    <br>As soon as I got to ljegun bus stop, one of them brought out a gun to stop me.
    <br>I stopped and got out with my wife to ask the policeman what had happened.
    <br>One of them said that he didn't want to hear any story from me - he was the one who had a gun.
    <br>He said that I should give him 2000 naira
    <br>I said we were coming from church; I was not using it as a commercial vehicle.
    <br>I said we were going home with my family, my wife and my four children.
    <br>and that we were coming from a prayer programme.
    <br>That was between the hours of 9 and 10.
    <br>I said that I did not have any money with me and that I was going home with my family and my wife.
    <br>One of them told us to go but as soon as my wife and I entered the 'keke tricycle'
    <br>and I was about to start the engine, I heard two gunshots.
    <br>I thought I was the only one the bullet hit.
    <br>The bullet cut through my right arm and pierced through my lower jaw.
    <br>I came down holding my jaw with blood gushing out
    <br>and that was when I heard my children shouting, "Mummy is dying! Mummy is dying!"
    <br>As soon as I heard that, I went back, looked inside the 'keke tricycle' and saw
    <br>that my wife had dropped the baby.
    <br>When I held my wife, I noticed that the bullet had pierced my wife from the right side of her brain
    <br>and it had come out through the left side of the brain.
    <br>My wife died instantly.
    <br>This is my family - my four children and I.
    <br>This is when I was in LUTH Hospital where I had undergone an operation after the incident.
    <br>This is the female doctor that handled my case.
    <br>The man standing here is my brother who has been following me everywhere I go.
    <br>Why are you here today? What is the reason that brought you here?
    <br>The reason I am here today is because of the gunshot of that day
    <br>and my children having had to watch their mother being killed in cold blood.
    <br>She died instantly as a result of the bullet.
    <br>The shock affected the brain of my first daughter here.
    <br>Since that day, she has not been herself.
    <br>She had convulsions several times.
    <br>I am confused, I need help from Prophet T.B. Joshua and sympathisers.
    <br>Please assist me.
    <br>My wife is still in the mortuary.
    <br>I am still undergoing treatment and I am yet to recover from the injury.
    <br>I need financial assistance and healing for my daughter.
    <br>You are saying that your daughter, because of the trauma of seeing her mother killed before her,
    <br>it has affected her psychologically since then?
    <br>Exactly. Since then, she has not been herself and also the rest of them.
    <br>My message to my brother, whatever you might have said,
    <br>I want to let you know that whatever that will lead to our last day on earth -
    <br>whether a plane crash, motor accident, gunshot, kidnapping,
    <br>dropped in hot soup, being panned or whatever -
    <br>does not testify to our Christian life, but the life we live is the one that matters.
    <br>I want you to put everything behind you.
    <br>While this was going on, there were a lot of text messages that came in from all over
    <br>and more are still coming in.
    <br>A gentleman here donated one million naira.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A lot of other donations - even from overseas countries.
    <br>There is a donation of pounds and others.
    <br>Once this assistance comes, you will become part of our family and we will become part of your family.
    <br>We want you to forget everything, put it behind you.

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So that your dear one can rest in peace.
    <br>All this is disturbing the soul.
    <br>The soul wants to rest. It doesn't want to hear all this disturbance.
    <br>You said that you were coming from church.
    <br>Eh hen!
    <br>That is to tell you that God is aware.

    <br>Like I have said - other partners from all over the world are donating.
    <br>As they are donating, we will keep on giving it to you.
    <br>This is the reason why they wanted you to come out. They are supporting you.
    <br>We are not here to judge. If we judge, who will judge us on the last day.
    <br>Your dear one was coming from the place of worship.
    <br>Unless you don't believe that your dear one was coming from a living church.
    <br>If you know that she was coming from church, what else again.
    <br>Whatever happened, God is aware.
    <br>Please, put everything behind you.
    <br>All the financial support you need, you are part of our family from today.
    <br>We are going to add you to the martyr we have all over the world.

    <br>We will put your family among the dear ones we have in the past, we will take care of you.
    <br>Okay? Put it behind you.
    <br>Children, how are you?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>God bless you. My name is Godwin Sunday Udoh.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria
    <br>An incident happened to me.
    <br>I was the man that the police shot at and killed my wife last year on September 16, 2015.
    <br>I was helpless after the incident happened. Nobody could help me.
    <br>I had to rush to Prophet T.B. Joshua, crying to him.
    <br>As soon as they saw me, they quickly helped me.
    <br>They gave me the sum of 5 million naira to establish and treat myself and to take care of my children.
    <br>Not only that - other partners from all over the world and from Nigeria as well supported me.
    <br>I really appreciate the good works of the man of God towards me and my family.
    <br>May the Lord bless him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I was advised by the man of God to go and bury my wife and forget about the past and the police.
    <br>I had to obey.
    <br>I just came back from burying my wife and this is the programme of the burial.
    <br>My children are now in school.
    <br>May the Lord's name be glorified, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Mr Godwin Sunday Udoh & Children Sharing Life Experience
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>As you rightly said, after the incidence happened,
    <br>you moved from one place to another - all to no avail - in search of solution and help,
    <br>until you found your way to The SCOAN.
    <br>After narrating your ordeal, the man of God was touched with the Lord's compassion
    <br>and he summoned Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world
    <br>and also gave you the sum of 5 million naira to support you and the entire family
    <br>and also to assist in your wife's burial.
    <br>You are here to tell us that you have completed the burial activities,
    <br>you have established yourself and your children are back to school.
    <br>Is that what you are trying to say?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Mr Godwin Sunday Udoh & Children Sharing Life Experience
    <br>Without taking much of your time, could you just give a word of advice to all that are listening to you,
    <br>concerning the goodness of the Lord in your life.
    <br>My advice to the world today is that:
    <br>No matter the situation you are experiencing, put your trust and faith in the Lord,
    <br>believing that God will surely meet you at the point of your needs, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>May the Lord bless the man of God and continue to take him higher and higher
    <br>and also promote this ministry, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Before you go finally, we also want to update the viewers concerning your daughter,
    <br>who developed facial palsy as a result of witnessing the horrible incident of the mother's death.
    <br>What do you have to say about your daughter's condition right now?
    <br>God has taken control.
    <br>God has done marvellously well by healing her.
    <br>After ministering the Morning Water that was given to me by the Prophet,
    <br>my daughter recovered and she was healed.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ for that!
