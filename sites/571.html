    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>When we resist the devil with a lively, active faith, satan would flee before us.
    <br>A believer is one who believes what it takes to cast out satan.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, come out!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>It takes the authority in the name Jesus to command satan and direct him where to go.
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>His power and authority have not stopped,
    <br>just because He is no longer visible in our midst.
    <br>As it was, so it is.
    <br>Can you see why the work of God is delicate?
    <br>This is a stiff opposition.
    <br>If you are not heard by God, you will be heard by satan.
    <br>If you cannot deliver her, she will deliver you.
    <br>This is to tell you that we are not fighting a natural situation.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>My name is Stella Erasmus. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I was demon possessed.
    <br>Because of the demon inside of me, it was impossible for me
    <br>even to walk up to my husband, give him a hug and tell him I love him.
    <br>I couldn't do it.
    <br>All the things I want to do, I didn't do and all the things I didn't want to do, I do.
    <br>But then I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>While I was here, the prophet was walking up and down, praying for people.
    <br>The demon inside of me grabbed hold of the chair.
    <br>I wanted to attack Prophet T.B. Joshua but the authority of God
    <br>in him was so powerful, so mighty.
    <br>It was impossible.
    <br>He used the authority in God.
    <br>I was down on the floor and he delivered me from the demon.
    <br>I thank God that he delivered me from that demon.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>We welcome you here to The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Madam, please tell us your name and your age.
    <br>My name is Stella Erasmus. I am 37 years old.
    <br>We saw you at the prayer line yesterday being prayed for by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Can you explain to us why you were in the prayer line?
    <br>I was demon possessed.
    <br>The demon - his face was like a triangle and his eyes were far apart.
    <br>Where his eyes were, there were also horns -
    <br>they weren't long, they were whitish, with a grey stripe;
    <br>a thick grey stripe on each horn.
    <br>He had a long face and arms up till the ellbow.
    <br>Can I show you guys?
    <br>His arms were like this.
    <br>He couldn't move this part.
    <br>He could only move it the way I'm showing you now.
    <br>His hands were very big; they were too big for his body.
    <br>He had big hips.
    <br>The bones - there wasn't even flesh.
    <br>The bones were also white and dry - they were like dry bones; very dry.
    <br>He had very long legs and his feet were very big.
    <br>His hands and nails were very long.
    <br>His hands had wrinkles like on little babies' hands and were white.
    <br>He was just very ugly.
    <br>What were the things that this problem made you to do?
    <br>It was so easy for me to attract men and to seduce them.
    <br>When they passed me, they would look back - I just knew that.
    <br>My marriage was a total disaster.
    <br>I couldn't allow my husband to get near me.
    <br>Even when he touched me, it irritated me a lot.
    <br>I couldn't walk up to my husband to give him a hug
    <br>even though I felt inside that I wanted to hug him.
    <br>The desire was there to hug him but I couldn't get to him to hug him or even kiss him.
    <br>If he touched me, it felt as if I could scream at him and
    <br>say, "Stop it, I don't like it".
    <br>I also have children.
    <br>When they were playing around me - I love my children so much -
    <br>I might just start talking, it irritated me incredibly.
    <br>I would chase them away and tell them, "Just go outside and play,
    <br>but not around where I am sitting!"
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to pray for me,
    <br>I grabbed hold of my chair because I didn't want to jump up
    <br>but the demon inside of me wanted to attack the prophet.
    <br>At one moment the anger was so much inside of me.
    <br>I knew that if I could get to the prophet
    <br>with the authority I had in me, I could attack him
    <br>but because of the authority he had in Jesus Christ--
    <br>So you mean that during the prayer, you literally wanted to attack the prophet
    <br>because of the demon inside of you.
    <br>But then, you could not because of the authority of Jesus Christ
    <br>when the prophet was praying for you.
    <br>Tell us, how did it feel?
    <br>We saw how you tried many times to stand up. What stopped you?
    <br>What was it that actually stopped you from touching the prophet?
    <br>The authority in his voice that he has in Jesus Christ.
    <br>I couldn't even look at him.
    <br>It is just like you don't have control over your body.
    <br>I looked away; he just started to turn and I looked away.
    <br>I couldn't look at him - it is the presence of God. It is overwhelming.
    <br>Why could you actually not look at Prophet T.B. Joshua while the prayer was going on?
    <br>What did you see that would stop you from looking at Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>It was the light of Jesus Christ in him.
    <br>When he told me to sit down, I couldn't resist.
    <br>It is like the Word of God says, "Every knee shall bow".
    <br>That's what happened there.
    <br>I just sat down because of the authority.
    <br>When the prophet prayed for me, there was no more anger inside of me.
    <br>It's a calmness inside of me.
    <br>Before, I was always in a hurry; I was all over the place.
    <br>But after the prayer, there is a calmness inside of me.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ! Hallelujah!
    <br>You mean, immediately after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>you felt that the demon left you and you felt a calmness,
    <br>a peace in your heart that you had not experienced before.
    <br>Yes. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Oh, that's wonderful! Let's clap for Jesus Christ! Hallelujah!
    <br>Now that Jesus Christ has set you free, tell us about your mind now.
    <br>Are you still having any of those negative thoughts you used to have?
    <br>No, there are no negative thoughts.
    <br>And you are free?
    <br>Yes, I am free!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the miracle-working Jesus Christ!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>My promise to God is to go and sin no more.
    <br>I would like to give advice to people outside there.
    <br>Please, if you don't have faith in the name of Jesus Christ, don't use it.
    <br>You can cause so much problems for yourself.
    <br>Read your Bible with devotion.
    <br>Don't use the name in vain.
    <br>Amen. That's a wonderful advice to everyone of us here.
    <br>We thank God for your life.
    <br>We thank Jesus that you are set free from this problem forever.
    <br>And we pray that God will give you the grace to continue to go and sin no more
    <br>as you promised, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
