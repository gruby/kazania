  <p>    
    <br>The case of this little boy is tragic.
    <br>He is suffering from the consequences of an acid intake.
    <br>His oesophagus - the tube that connects his throat to his stomach - has suffered severe damage.
    <br>The only way he can be fed is through the pipe we can see protruding through his nose,
    <br>coiled and painfully stuck to the side of his face.
    <br>His agony is clear to see.
    <br>I am Mr Sunday Nosike. I came from Kano State, Nigeria.
    <br>The young boy on your lap, who is he to you?
    <br>The boy on my lap is my son.
    <br>- What is his name?
    <br>- His name is Joshua Nosike.
    <br>How old is he and where is he from?
    <br>He is four years old.
    <br>We came together from Kano State.
    <br>And the woman sitting next to you, who is she to you?
    <br>The woman sitting next to me is my wife.
    <br>Can you tell us the problem that brought your son to The SCOAN today?
    <br>My son drank acid.
    <br>The incident happened on November 11th.
    <br>You mean, your son had acid intake? In other words, he drank acid?
    <br>Yes, he drank acid.
    <br>When he drank the acid, his throat was blocked.
    <br>He couldn't breathe any longer.
    <br>It was by the grace of God that
    <br>we rushed him to the clinic and from there they referred us to the hospital.
    <br>We spent about one month and two weeks there.
    <br>Since then, he has not been taking anything.
    <br>They connected this pipe to enable us to give him liquid.
    <br>What is the purpose of this pipe passing through his nose?
    <br>The purpose of the pipe is to enable him to take something like pap,
    <br>sending the liquid food through the pipe to enter his stomach.
    <br>You mean, your son cannot be fed through his mouth, but only through the pipe in his nose?
    <br>Yes, he cannot be fed through his mouth.
    <br>What kind of food do you give to him?
    <br>He can only take pap and things like minerals (soft drink) or tea.
    <br>You cannot give him any solid food?
    <br>No, he cannot take any solid food.
    <br>For how long has he been like this?
    <br>Since November.
    <br>He has been feeding through the pipe. He cannot eat any solid food.
    <br>He only takes liquid things.
    <br>They referred us from where we are,
    <br>now that we should go for a surgical operation at Enugu Teaching Hospital.
    <br>Before he had this problem, was he eating through his mouth?
    <br>He was eating very well. Even that very day, he ate rice in the afternoon before the incident happened.
    <br>- Before he drank acid, he ate rice?
    <br>- Yes, he ate rice.
    <br>But now, can he eat rice?
    <br>No, he cannot eat rice through his mouth. We are using a pipe to feed him.
    <br>How did you get to know about The SCOAN?
    <br>I used to see it on television, Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Through Emmanuel TV, I have seen a lot of miracles that happened,
    <br>so I believe that my own will not be different.
    <br>I know, by the grace of God, God will surely answer me here.
    <br>Amen. You said the woman sitting next to you is your wife.
    <br>Yes, she is my wife. Let's hear from her.
    <br>The doctor passed the pipe through the nose into the intestines.
    <br>That is what I am feeding him through.
    <br>Joshua Nosike's mother explains that the only way to feed her son is through the pipe inserted through his nose.
    <br>She reaches into her bag and brings out a flask, ready to show us how the pipe is used.
    <br>She fills the lid with water.
    <br>I will use this syringe to draw the water.
    <br>Then, I will open the mouth of the pipe here.
    <br>I will place the syringe here and I will start pumping it.
    <br>- Do you fix the syringe to the pipe?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Mrs Nosike shows us how she uses the syringe filled with water -
    <br>the only way of getting anything into Joshua's stomach.
    <br>There is no other way she can sustain her son.
    <br>Imagine the effects this would have on a growing child, unable to receive the nutrients he needs.
    <br>How would any parent feel seeing their child in such a terrible condition?
    <br>We are not happy ourselves at all.

    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>I want to cover the mouth of the pipe back again with another new plaster.
    <br>After four years, Joshua is at a stage in his life when healthy food is very important.
    <br>But after swallowing acid, eating and drinking anything has become impossible.
    <br>His parents have brought him to The SCOAN for prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua, desperate for God to heal him.
    <br>At The SCOAN Healing And Deliverance Service,
    <br>Mr Nosike cries out in distress, explaining the painful case of his son.
    <br>Please help us. My son drank acid.
    <br>He can no longer feed through his mouth.
    <br>Please help us.
    <br>He can only feed through this hose that they connected through his nose.
    <br>Please, man of God, help him.
    <br>They referred us for surgery from the hospital we went to, to Enugu Teaching Hospital.
    <br>Please, man of God, help us.
    <br>He can only eat through this hose and he can only take liquid things.
    <br>- Man of God, please help us.
    <br>- What happened to him?
    <br>He drank acid on November 11th last year.
    <br>They have now connected this thing to be eating only pap.
    <br>Don't worry. I will spray the anointed water.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>He will start eating through his mouth now.
    <br>Thank you! Amen.
    <br>The Lord will operate on the entrance.
    <br>He will eat through his mouth.
    <br>You can now take him to the hospital and remove the pipe,
    <br>so that he can now live a normal life.
    <br>Okay, thank you.
    <br>Accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Father, we thank You. In Your name ...
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, Prophet T.B. Joshua sprays the anointed water into the little boy's mouth and nose.
    <br>Drink!
    <br>WATCH THIS AMAZING MIRACLE
    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to spray the anointed water,
    <br>tracing the line of Joshua's damaged oesophagus - the passage linking the stomach and the throat.
    <br>Go and give him food.
    <br>He will eat through the mouth.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Joshua is declared free and his parents rejoice.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We are happy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My son is healed. My son is okay.
    <br>This pipe should be removed by doctors.
    <br>The Lord is using them to treat, while the Lord heals people.
    <br>Don't remove this. You take him back to the hospital. The doctors will remove it.
    <br>But he will now eat through the mouth.
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank you, sir.

    <br>Praise the Lord! Joshua is eagerly eating custard through his mouth.
    <br>Remember, this is exactly what Prophet T.B. Joshua said before he applied the anointed water,
    <br>"He will start eating through his mouth now".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! He can now eat through his mouth.

    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>I thank Jesus. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>This is the anointed water - the medium God used to heal little Joshua.
    <br>Remember, it is not the water that heals, but God Himself, as the anointing is done in His name.
    <br>After his complete healing that service day,
    <br>the man of God advised Joshua's parents to take him back to the same hospital in Kanu State
    <br>that originally inserted the pipe through Joshua's nose into his stomach, to have the pipe removed.
    <br>He soon came back to The SCOAN to give his testimony.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Having removed the pipe, Joshua poses for the camera looking happy and healthy.
    <br>From the moment young Joshua was healed, when Prophet T.B. Joshua sprayed the anointed water on him,
    <br>he has been eating and drinking normally.
    <br>You can see from his appearance that he has gained weight and is a contented little four year old.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>My name is Joshua Nosike.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I am four years old.
    <br>How are you now?
    <br>Fine. I feel okay.
    <br>When the pipe was in your stomach, how did you used to feel?
    <br>I felt pain.
    <br>You felt pain. And what else?
    <br>I felt pain.
    <br>They have removed the pipe now. How are you feeling now?
    <br>I feel fine.
    <br>You feel fine. Let us clap for Jesus.

    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Mr Sunday Nosike. We came from Kano State, Nigeria.
    <br>On 11th November last year, 2008, he drank acid.
    <br>We took him to Kano Teaching Hospital.
    <br>They admitted him for one month and two weeks.
    <br>Since then, he couldn't eat through his mouth.
    <br>He could only eat through the pipe they connected through his nose.
    <br>The doctor said that the acid had destroyed his oesophagus,
    <br>where the food used to pass through.
    <br>He referred us for a major operation at Enugu Teaching Hospital.
    <br>I used to watch Emmanuel TV in my house.
    <br>I now said that I have to take him to The SCOAN because I know my own case will not be different.
    <br>We came here and the man of God prayed for my son.
    <br>He used the anointed water to spray on his mouth.
    <br>He also sprayed on the surgery they did to him at the neck.
    <br>He sprayed on his stomach where the acid had passed through.
    <br>He said we should immediately go and give him food.
    <br>I was surprised. A boy that cannot eat through his mouth!
    <br>I was still doubting.
    <br>My wife and I took him down. They prepared custard for him.
    <br>The boy started eating. For the first time I was shocked. I was happy!
    <br>I couldn't believe my eyes.
    <br>After taking the custard, they brought Lucozade Boost to him. He finished it!
    <br>After that, he still said that he was feeling hungry. I thought he was joking.
    <br>He saw Gala (snacks). He picked it himself saying he wanted to eat it.
    <br>He started eating the Gala.
    <br>I was happy.
    <br>Thank God.
    <br>WATCH THIS AMAZING MIRACLE
    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>After that, the man of God said that we should go back to Kano
    <br>so that the doctor will remove the pipe.
    <br>When we went to Kano, he gave us transport money - 20,000 Naira.
    <br>When we went to the hospital, the doctor was trying to argue.
    <br>I said, "You can see that my son is eating".
    <br>I brought Gala in front of the doctor. The boy finished eating it.
    <br>They brought mineral (soft drink). He finished it in front of the doctor.
    <br>The doctor had to take him to the theatre and remove the pipe.
    <br>Since then, the boy has been eating. We have no problem.

    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>The evangelists bring him a hearty meal to once again show that he is completely healed.
    <br>Joshua digs into a plate of fried rice and chicken devouring it with pleasure.
    <br>We can see him eating and drinking without any difficulty.
    <br>This is truly an incredible miracle.
    <br>Remember the pitiful state in which Joshua's parents brought him to The SCOAN.
    <br>He was unable to consume anything except through the pipe which was passed into his stomach through his nose.
    <br>He was living entirely on liquid food as his oesophagus had been severely damaged
    <br>when he drank acid on 11th November 2008.
    <br>When he was brought to The SCOAN Healing And Deliverance Service for prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>he sprayed the anointed water into Joshua's mouth and along the damaged area, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>He was instantly healed and his life was restored.
    <br>After travelling back to Kano State to have the same doctor that inserted the pipe into his nose
    <br>remove it, according to the advice of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the little boy and his parents came back to The SCOAN to testify and here he is.
    <br>Joshua Nosike is healed and is seen here eating and drinking freely.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Esther Nosike.
    <br>The little boy beside me is Joshua Nosike.
    <br>And this is Dr Emmanuel Kolo.
    <br>We are from Kano State.
    <br>We were here eight years ago when my son drank acid.
    <br>When he came back from school,
    <br>and while I was attending to the little baby with me, Joshua drank acid from a bottle.
    <br>From there we went directly to hospital
    <br>and they told us that he needed to be operated on, and there was a 50% chance of success.
    <br>To the glory of God and to the shame of satan, the operation was successful.
    <br>After the operation, he could not eat food anymore.
    <br>The doctor told us that he needed to go for another surgery to be able to eat food
    <br>because the acid had damaged his oesophagus.
    <br>We went to several places for healing, but to no avail.
    <br>When my husband came home from work, we watched Emmanuel TV,
    <br>that is when we decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>At that stage, Joshua could not eat anything and could not even take water.
    <br>I had to feed him through a pipe in his nose, which we saw on the screen now.
    <br>When we came to The SCOAN,
    <br>God used Prophet T.B. Joshua through the medium of the anointed water to heal my son.
    <br>Since that moment, there is nothing that he is not able to eat.
    <br>There is no sickness, no affliction at all.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>You made us understand that due to the emergency of the case, when your son drank the acid
    <br>he was rushed to the hospital and they did an emergency operation
    <br>to connect a pipe through his nose to his intestines.
    <br>They had to bypass his oesophagus because it was completely damaged due to the acid he drank.
    <br>You said that after the operation the brother could not eat anything. Is that right?
    <br>Yes. He could not eat.
    <br>And afterwards there was another operation they also recommended.
    <br>Where was he supposed to go for this operation?
    <br>The doctor referred us to India for the operation.
    <br>It was during the course of considering what to do, that you now had an encounter with Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And when you came, can you tell us once again what happened in the prayer line
    <br>when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, came to where your son was?
    <br>In the prayer line, when Prophet T.B. Joshua ministered the anointing water,
    <br>immediately he started eating and he was even asking for more.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>And ever since you obeyed the instruction of the man of God
    <br>that this pipe should not be removed by any of you,
    <br>that you should go back to the same doctor who inserted pipe, to remove it.
    <br>And after the removal of the pipe, ever since then until now, can you tell us about the state of your son?
    <br>Since then up to now, the doctor can give you more information,
    <br>but the boy is in a very good condition with good health.
    <br>And he can eat everything. There is nothing he cannot eat.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ for that?
    <br>Before listening to the medical doctor, let's hear from our young brother, Joshua.
    <br>WATCH THIS AMAZING MIRACLE
    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>- Joshua, how are you?
    <br>- Fine, sir.
    <br>- Tell us your name.
    <br>- My name is Joshua Nosike.
    <br>Before you continue with your testimony, how old are you now?
    <br>I'm eleven years old.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>Tell us your testimony.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>On a Sunday morning when I was preparing for church,
    <br>I was already dressed, so my friends and I were playing football outside.
    <br>The ball went straight to where the acid was kept.
    <br>I thought it was a Coke, so I drank it.
    <br>Before I knew what happened, it started hurting on my neck, so I called my mom.
    <br>My mom rushed me to a nearby hospital.
    <br>When we got there, they said that we should go to Enugu Teaching Hospital.
    <br>The doctor said that I would not be able to eat again until I went for surgery in India.
    <br>We came back home.
    <br>My daddy watched Emmanuel TV and so he decided that we should come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When we came here, God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to heal me.
    <br>Up to now I am eating all manner of food. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>You heard it from our little brother who said that he is eleven years old now.
    <br>And then when we was brought to The SCOAN with this problem, he was four years old.
    <br>He said it clearly that he drank this acid unknowingly, thinking that it was soft drink that was inside the bottle
    <br>because the acid was poured into a bottle meant for soft drink.
    <br>After drinking it, he felt uncomfortable and was unwell, so his parents rushed him to the hospital.
    <br>Immediately an operation was done to fix a pipe through which he was eating,
    <br>without which he couldn't eat. Not until the father had an encounter with Emmanuel TV
    <br>and brought him to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, ministered the anointed water - which is now the morning water - on him,
    <br>and that was how the passage was operated on by the Lord Jesus Christ, and it was opened.
    <br>He started eating and he said since then until now, he could eat and he is healed and healthy
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>- Can you tell us how you are feeling now?
    <br>- I am okay. Praise the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah. What can you say about Jesus Christ?
    <br>Jesus Christ is the One. Come to Him; He is going to help you.
    <br>To God be the glory. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Right now, let's hear from the medical doctor who presided over the case of Joshua.
    <br>We welcome you to The SCOAN.
    <br>Can you introduce yourself to us and tell us what you have to say about the case of Joshua?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Dr Emmanuel Kolo. I am an Associate Professor of Ear, Nose, Throat, Head and Neck Surgery.
    <br>I am also a Fellow of the West African College Of Surgeons.
    <br>I am also a Fellow of the National Post Graduate Medical College.
    <br>And I will be a Member of the International College Of Surgeons very soon.
    <br>WATCH THIS AMAZING MIRACLE
    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>Eight years ago my attention was called by the team that we had a case of child who ingested acid.
    <br>And that was a serious emergency, so we had to review the child.
    <br>The case of acid ingestion is a terrible and serious medical and surgical emergency.
    <br>I can liken the ingestion of acid to a burning bush fire,
    <br>because at that point in time, there is very little that you can do.
    <br>It has to finish all the reactions and all the damages have to take place.
    <br>That is why he told you that he spent a month in hospital - we had to wait for the acid to do the worst.
    <br>We could only then step in and see how we could salvage the situation.
    <br>We took him and assessed him.
    <br>We saw that he had a lot of damage to his oesophagus, which is the food-way,
    <br>and it was so extensive that we had to desperately take him to the theatre
    <br>and pass that tube that you saw on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Because that was the only hope for him to feed at that point in time.
    <br>In fact, when he presented to us, he could not swallow saliva - every drop of saliva had to be spat out.
    <br>That was how serious the situation was.
    <br>And after a month, we did an xray, which is a barium swallow,
    <br>which showed that he had extensive damage to the oesophagus and it was beyond what we could do.
    <br>We had to call the other Teaching Hospital and we called the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital in Enugu.
    <br>They said that they had to give the case a trial, assess it on its own merit and see what they could do.
    <br>We gave them the medical report, but told them that they should also prepare to go India
    <br>because the damage was very extensive.
    <br>And if they could not be helped in other centres in Nigeria, they had no other option but to go abroad.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, I have never watched Emmanuel TV, and my wife installed Emmanuel TV at about that time.
    <br>She said, "Come and see. God is doing so many things through Emmanuel TV",
    <br>and I said that I was not going to watch.
    <br>In fact, each time I passed the living room, I blocked one eye and looked at the screen with the other eye.
    <br>What really surprised me was that I saw the medical reports I gave to the family
    <br>being displayed on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I opened my two eyes and said, "Let's see what will happen. I know about this particular case.
    <br>We had a conference involving other surgeons and other specialists. And the only way out was surgery".
    <br>And I said, "Okay, let's see how this is going to end. I know about this case and I assessed it with my team".
    <br>I was surprised when the man of God came out and said Joshua was going to eat.
    <br>I got glued to the television. I said, "Today we will see".
    <br>The man of God sprayed the Morning Water
    <br>and what actually amazed me was that exactly where the oesophagus was damaged
    <br>- if you look at the clip - he was following towards the left side, as if he was there with us.
    <br>That was the exact place that was damaged, all the way to the stomach.
    <br>And if you look at the clip, he said, "Open your shirt" and the man of God was spraying the Morning Water.
    <br>I said, "How did this man know that this was the area? Why didn't he choose the other side?"
    <br>I started becoming interested in what was happening and I saw the boy started eating.
    <br>I was surprised. I said, "Okay, I have seen what I have never seen before. We will wait for the boy in Kano".
    <br>Since the man of God said that we should remove the tube,
    <br>we would do our own assessment and then decide for ourselves.
    <br>But before then, my son was two years old and was born with some rashes on his hand.
    <br>We met with a specialist dermatologist who was a consultant,
    <br>and he said that my son was born with the rashes
    <br>and there was nothing else we could do other than apply medication.
    <br>So I called my wife and said, "My eyes have seen what I have never seen before.
    <br>Bring the boy and place your hand on Emmanuel TV".
    <br>The boy did that while Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying and he said, "Amen".
    <br>What surprised me was that day by day the rashes disappeared and within two weeks they were all gone.
    <br>WATCH THIS AMAZING MIRACLE
    <br>SCIENCE CANNOT EXPLAIN!!!
    <br>That really surprised me and it made me glued to Emmanuel TV from then until this moment.
    <br>Now when Joshua came back to Kano, and they said that we should remove the tube, I was quiet.
    <br>We had to organise another conference with all the surgeons
    <br>and the radiologists who were in charge of the case and decide to remove the tube.
    <br>There were a lot of arguments at the conference. Some said, "No, maybe the food is passing somewhere.
    <br>We are quite sure of our initial assessment and we stand by our opinion".
    <br>But the father insisted that Joshua ate all kinds of solid food and consumed soft drinks and liquids,
    <br>and he insisted that we remove the tube.
    <br>We said, "Okay. Let them do an xray". And the father said, "No, remove the tube. My son is okay".
    <br>We said, "If that is the case, let us call the boy and see with our eyes what this child can do,
    <br>to substantiate what the father has just said".
    <br>So, he came to us and the father brought a snack, which was harder than boiled yam, with a bottle of Coke.
    <br>The boy devoured everything and swallowed it and belched.
    <br>We were surprised.
    <br>At that point in time we had to advise ourselves that common sense tells us that
    <br>everything we are saying is to enable this boy to eat again and if he is eating, what is the use of all these arguments.
    <br>The boy just had to go, but there was another situation that
    <br>we could not just let him go without doing the xray in order to fulfil all scientific and medical requirements.
    <br>But the father said, "No".
    <br>We said, "Okay. You are going to sign a form called 'DAMA' - you are going to be discharged against medical advice,
    <br>and should anything happen to you, you are on your own. We will not be held liable in any court of law".
    <br>And the father signed it quickly and took his son away.
    <br>Ever since that moment, I have had the privilege of seeing him twice now.
    <br>The boy has been fine. He eats all manner of food. I give God all the glory.
    <br>Ever since, it has made me a believer of everything that happens at The SCOAN.
    <br>I am a partner of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I have shared so many testimonies on this altar.
    <br>God has blessed me and now He has made me an Associate Professor.
    <br>I know very soon I will come and share my full Professorial Chair at The SCOAN. To God be the glory.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ. Put your hands together beautifully.
    <br>Our Lord is good all the time.
    <br>And all the time our Lord is good.
    <br>We have heard from you, a medical doctor.
    <br>And we thank God Almighty for what the Lord used you to do in the life of the boy,
    <br>and also what God has done through the medium of Emmanuel TV in your life and the entire family.
    <br>We also rejoice with Joshua for the blessing he received through our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Sir, I want to ask you what word of advice do you have to crown off the whole thing?
    <br>My word of advice is: Jesus remains the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>And especially to my colleagues: Whatever we do and whatever we say, Jesus has the final say.
    <br>We care, but God heals.
    <br>And with that, to God be all the glory.
    <br>Indeed, to God be the glory.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Also, thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule to join Joshua for his wonderful testimony.
    <br>We pray that as you go and maintain your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>better is not good enough; the best is yet to come.
    <br>And to Joshua and the mom, we pray that as the Lord uses you to bring up this boy in His glory,
    <br>the boy will not depart from it.
    <br>And the destiny which the Lord has prepared for him, will be achieved, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again, shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
