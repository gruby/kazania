  <p>    
    <br>Good morning, my name is Usiwoma. I am a Doctor in Timișoara, Romania.
    <br>I have here with me Dr. Oana.
    <br>Hello!
    <br>When the coronavirus started, especially when we started having cases in Romania and in my city,
    <br>it really caused panic because we usually attend to patients from all over the country
    <br>and even outside the country.
    <br>I remember one of my colleagues saying that she was just waiting to die.
    <br>How did you feel when you heard about the coronavirus?
    <br>I felt a bit worried, but I was more concerned for my parents because they are older.
    <br>And you?
    <br>I kept on praying with Emmanuel TV and it really strengthened me.
    <br>On Sunday, the prophet posted an announcement on Facebook
    <br>that there will be showers of rain that will wipe away the fear of the unknown.
    <br>I noticed also that it started raining, so I immediately ran outside and made sure I got wet.
    <br>Each day, I prayed with the prophet for the patients that had coronavirus and for the doctors.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, no one enjoys being sick.
    <br>Lord Jesus, Your children need Your healing hand - heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Whatever virus, wherever it is in the body - heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Those on the sickbed,
    <br>may your doctors, nurses, caregivers sense the presence of God, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Sense the presence of God, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>On the 23rd, there was some news on national TV called 'Știrile PRO TV'
    <br>where it reported that 51 out of 54 patients were healed in a hospital in Timișoara;
    <br>how did the doctors do it?
    <br>And there was a video of the Head of the Section of Infectious Diseases
    <br>and under it, it said, "A hope of healing in the fight against this fearful virus comes from Timișoara."
    <br>I got calls from all over the world, from abroad.
    <br>Right now, we have received a phone call from Switzerland asking us to tell them our protocol.
    <br>It has been heard everywhere that we have very very good results.
    <br>At your hospital in Timișoara, you have the highest number of healed patients. What is the secret?
    <br>The secret of the cured people from Timișoara is the favourable conjuncture and seriousness
    <br>of the team of doctors and nurses who participate in the treatment of these patients.
    <br>In total, in Timișoara, out of 54 patients found positive with coronavirus, 51 were already discharged.
    <br>Thus the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Timișoara became the centre of Romania,
    <br>with the highest rate of patients cured of COVID-19.
    <br>I was really grateful to God because I know He helped the doctors choose the right treatment protocol.
    <br>As was reported, all the patients recovered between 3 to 5 days.
    <br>How it is done is that they are tested, and after being negative,
    <br>they have to wait for 14 days and get tested again and if they are still negative,
    <br>they are discharged to their home.
    <br>When I made a calculation of this time, it all pointed to after the rain;
    <br>that is when God really started doing this work.
    <br>There was lots of rejoicing, calmness, and donations to the hospital.
    <br>How did you feel after you heard all the news?
    <br>I was happy because I know that God turns every bad situation into something good.
    <br>As the Bible says in Jeremiah,
    <br>" 'For I know the plans and thoughts I have for you,' says the Lord,
    <br>'plans for peace and well-being and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.' "
    <br>And you?
    <br>I was really grateful to God, encouraged and strengthened.
    <br>After some days, we got an announcement in the hospital that we will start operating
    <br>on patients with the coronavirus who have surgical emergencies, if any cases arise.
    <br>I kept on praying and the following Sunday, as the prophet always does,
    <br>he prays for patients with coronavirus and he prays for doctors,
    <br>but on that specific Sunday, after the announcement in the hospital,
    <br>he prayed for surgeons and I was amazed!
    <br>Those on the sickbed - Lord Jesus, guide the medical practitioners, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Guide the surgeon's hands.
    <br>May their bodies respond quickly to treatment, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
    <br>It really strengthened me and encouraged me, knowing that God is concerned about patients with coronavirus.
    <br>He is concerned about the doctors, nurses and everyone involved in taking care of these patients.
    <br>There is something the prophet always says, that we should not fear.
    <br>Medically, when there is constant fear, it causes the cortisol in our bodies
    <br>to reduce the immune-boosting and the infection-fighting cells.
    <br>This means our immune system is going to be weakened against fighting infection,
    <br>or even cancer.
    <br>We really need our immune system at this time.
    <br>Also, when there is fear and anxiety, it reduces the amount of oxygen
    <br>and glucose going to our heart and large muscles.
    <br>It can also lead to heart problems.
    <br>It can also affect our reasoning, our brain.
    <br>It can cause ulcers, it leads to early ageing and even premature death.
    <br>So, as much as we wash our hands, keep social distancing and boost our immune system,
    <br>it is very important that we protect our immune system by refusing to fear.
    <br>Right now, begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear!
    <br>Fear of cancer, virus, coronavirus, affliction, disappointment, fear of this and that -
    <br>begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear!
    <br>Resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let us relax in Jesus, the Name above coronavirus, knowing that God is faithful and true.
    <br>Emmanuel!
