  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is ministering prayer and deliverance
    <br>to the congregation, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The name that has power and authority over all forms of demonic principalities.
    <br>Let's watch how the power from above exposes the evil spirits
    <br>behind the godless activities and destructive elements in this man's life.
    <br>Freemason. Do you know what I mean?
    <br>I am from Tanzania, Dar es Salaam.
    <br>I get more money. Do you know what I mean?
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>Do you know what I mean? Who are you?
    <br>This is T.B. Joshua. I was waiting for...
    <br>I was waiting for a long time.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am a freemason.
    <br>Look at this - what is this?
    <br>Do you want to see my chest?
    <br>What is on your chest?
    <br>In my chest, I have something.
    <br>Open it.
    <br>I open it.
    <br>I have power. Let me show you.
    <br>Remove - can you open it.
    <br>There is fire here.
    <br>What is it?
    <br>Do you know this one?
    <br>What is it - you don't know?
    <br>This one?
    <br>Behind - look behind!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>This one is from the village.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>What is this mark for? What is it for?
    <br>This is the mark of a freemason.
    <br>You have fire here. I will explain all.
    <br>As the fire of the Holy Spirit consumes every negative power in his body,
    <br>he throws the ring which has been the connection between him and the darkness on the floor.
    <br>What is this? Fire! So much fire here!
    <br>So much fire!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>One more touch from above, he falls under the influence of the anointing.
    <br>As the realisation of his deliverance comes over him,
    <br>he quickly stands and puts his clothes back on.
    <br>He is delivered.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Soon after his deliverance, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave Mr Agustino Charles Fungo a word of prophecy.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You were the one giving me a ring.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>I was a freemason.
    <br>It is not a ring you should give me.
    <br>Please, Man of God.
    <br>There was something they gave you to drink.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Agustino Charles.
    <br>I'm from Tanzania, Dar es Salaam.
    <br>I'm 31 years old.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>I'm a business man.
    <br>The man of God prophesied to me about a ring.
    <br>This is true; I confirm that it is true.
    <br>One day, I went to a witch doctor to boost my business.
    <br>The witch doctor told me that he was supposed to buy a ring.
    <br>He said I was to give him different currencies - dollars...
    <br>When I gave it to him, he said I needed to go to a shop.
    <br>He told me to just choose a good hotel in Dar es Salaam.
    <br>That I would hear a voice.
    <br>I didn't know what I could do.
    <br>I went to choose a hotel; I went to one hotel that was big and nice.
    <br>When I entered the hotel - it was in the afternoon -
    <br>I would see so many people in black suits.
    <br>When I entered that hotel, I saw one lady;
    <br>she was looking at me and I was also looking at her.
    <br>After some time, I saw her in my room.
    <br>She was coming with juice - like a juice.
    <br>I heard a voice saying, "Drink".
    <br>I drank that juice.
    <br>When I was going out, it was in the afternoon.
    <br>But after a short time - thirty minutes - I was thinking,
    <br>"Why is it night? What kind of life is this?"
    <br>I was not feeling well.
    <br>When I continued living my life, my business, it was not going well; it went down.
    <br>When I wanted to do something, I couldn't do it again; I was doing something different.
    <br>I was gambling with 500 dollars, 200 dollars.
    <br>One day I was gambling with more money - 2000 dollars.
    <br>When I was gambling with 2000 dollars, I asked myself, "What kind of life is this?"
    <br>Sometimes, if I got money - maybe 1 million or any money -
    <br>I would feel I was not from Africa but from America.
    <br>I could speak slang, like American slang
    <br>as if I was from a different country, not Africa.
    <br>It was a spirit; it was not me.
    <br>I know that it was not me.
    <br>The spirit was bad for me.
    <br>Yes, truly, it was not the brother himself.
    <br>As you can see on the screen of your television, on the left-hand side is the brother
    <br>when the evil spirit in him was manifesting after that divine touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So since your deliverance, can you tell us - how are you feeling now?
    <br>I'm feeling okay.
    <br>I can't explain it because I know what I'm feeling here in my heart.
    <br>I have peace; I'm born again.
    <br>Hallelujah. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Now, I'm free. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let us put our hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for setting this brother free
    <br>from that evil spirit that had tormented his life for so long.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>He has delivered you and set you free completely for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Make sure you continue to follow Him along the way
    <br>and make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and we know that He will continue to guide your steps
    <br>and we pray that God Almighty will give you that grace
    <br>to stay far from sin and be close to Him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus.
