    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>This young boy came to The SCOAN with a horrific skin disease,
    <br>which had plagued his life for the past eight years affecting all his extremities.
    <br>The disease had spread its gruesome grip over the palms of his hands and across his fingers,
    <br>attacking the skin and flesh of his hands, giving them a horrible, fungus-covered appearance,
    <br>which was both extremely irritant and unbearably painful.
    <br>It had also extended to the back of his hands with infection and sores.
    <br>Moving down his body following the flow of blood,
    <br>this terrible virus had broken the skin of both legs in several places
    <br>and caused the affected areas to become dry, shiny and itchy.
    <br>But the worst sight is found on the boy's feet,
    <br>where the disease increased it's fetid hold.
    <br>The entirety of both his feet are smothered in this ugly, destructive fungal infection,
    <br>from the tips of his toes to the soles of his feet.
    <br>The raw pinkish flesh peeks out behind the dreadful imprisonment under the disease.
    <br>The appearance of this boy's feet is so alarming
    <br>and serves to remind us that satan's sicknesses and diseases are thieves of joy,
    <br>time, effort, energy and material.
    <br>The cause of such afflictions are nothing other than evil spirits, demons and devils.
    <br>For this purpose the Son of God, Jesus Christ was made manifest
    <br>to destroy the works of the devil.
    <br>Let us hear from the young man.
    <br>My name is Ugan Alphonsus, I'm 15 years old.
    <br>I am from Cross River State, Nigeria.
    <br>I have had a skin disease for eight years now.
    <br>It has created a lot of pain for me.
    <br>I find it hard to study in school because of the pain.
    <br>Sometimes I cannot sleep at night and it itches a lot.
    <br>So, it distracts me from other things that I have to do in the day.
    <br>I cannot walk well and I cannot go out.
    <br>I have been to many hospitals, medicine homes and herbalists but no solution.
    <br>I believe that the Lord God Almighty is going to heal me from this skin disease forever.
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Mr Alphonsus Ugan was taken to The SCOAN prayer line,
    <br>where he received prayer from wise man Daniel, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>A short time later, Mr Alphonsus came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify of the miraculous healing our Lord Jesus Christ had done in his life.
    <br>Everything about his skin has completely changed
    <br>and now glows with radiant good health.
    <br>The infection on the palms of his hands has totally dried up
    <br>and the sores are healed on both his palms and the backs of his hands and his fingers.
    <br>All the dry, itchy skin on his legs has gone, leaving only one mark on his right leg
    <br>where the sores used to be.
    <br>But best of all, his feet, which once looked so wrinkled and deformed
    <br>have been transformed back to the original position, in which God made them,
    <br>after the prayer of wise man Daniel, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Comparing his toes, you can see on the left side of the screen the nightmarish condition he came in,
    <br>and on the right side the glorious work of the Master Healer, Jesus Christ,
    <br>who levelled the mountain of sickness and disease in this boy's life, for His name sake.
    <br>The Bible says the resurrection power of Jesus Christ is transmitted to His followers,
    <br>giving them a glorious new existence.
    <br>It is this resurrection power that was transmitted through the prayer of the wise man
    <br>that has set this boy free, and free indeed.
    <br>The soles of his feet bear only a few telltale signs,
    <br>as the old skin is peeling away and the new healthy, smooth skin is coming through.
    <br>The skin and flesh of his toes are back to normal
    <br>and are clear of any of the hideous disease that once clung to them.
    <br>What is left to say, other than "Thank You, Jesus Christ"?
    <br>The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>This is evidence; his life has changed and to Jesus Christ be all the glory.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Before | After
    <br>WATCH This FUNGUS Infested Foot HEAL!!!
    <br>Master Ugan Alphonsus has come back to The SCOAN to testify to the remarkable healing
    <br>he received, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's listen to his wonderful testimony.
    <br>My name is Ugan Alphonsus, I'm 16 years old, I'm from Cross River State.
    <br>The lady standing next to me is my mum.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was skin disease.
    <br>It affected me for ten years.
    <br>It started as a small sore but it grew and spread to every part of my body.
    <br>I couldn't walk, do the basic things of life or even go to school.
    <br>My mum had to carry me on her back like a baby.
    <br>Sometimes she had to feed me; I couldn't wash my own clothes.
    <br>The pain was so much and I was mentally depressed.
    <br>I sat down at home all day.
    <br>I couldn't play or hang out with my friends.
    <br>I couldn't go out.
    <br>Some people avoided me because of the smell that emitted from the disease.
    <br>The pain was so severe that at times I would just sit down and cry all day.
    <br>My mum took me to many hospitals and herbal homes but there was no solution.
    <br>There was a teaching hospital in my state that my mum took me to
    <br>but the more they treated it, the worse the condition became.
    <br>The doctor said that the problem was a fungal infection.
    <br>He gave me the strongest drug that can be prescribed for fungal infection
    <br>but there was no cure and the doctor just gave up.
    <br>He looked at me in the face and told me that there was nothing he could do.
    <br>Everybody was surprised.
    <br>We went from one herbal home to another but there was no solution.
    <br>Everybody was shocked.
    <br>The whole family were wondering what we were going to do.
    <br>One day, my mum was watching Emmanuel TV at a neighbour's house
    <br>and she saw the wonderful things that God was using the man of God and the wise men to do.
    <br>She said, "Let's go to The SCOAN; it will be your final bus stop."
    <br>She saw people with similar conditions to mine receiving their healing
    <br>so she decided to bring me here.
    <br>When we arrived in Lagos, by the grace of God, I was placed at the prayer line.
    <br>At the prayer line, when wise man Daniel prayed for me,
    <br>I felt something leaving my body and I felt light.
    <br>I felt happy deep inside of me and immediately, I stood up and walked on my own,
    <br>to the glory of God.
    <br>Today, here I am; I am healed; to God be the glory!
    <br>To God be the glory indeed.
    <br>Can you tell us how long you were suffering from this problem?
    <br>For nearly ten years.
    <br>How long have you been healed from this problem?
    <br>I came here last year - I have been healed for a year now.
    <br>After the prayer, gradually everything was cleansed and I received my healing fully.
    <br>Now, I am back to school.
    <br>I am in my second year in university, studying Political Science.
    <br>What about your social life?
    <br>Did you have any contacts with friends?
    <br>I couldn't have any contacts with friends; some of them even avoided me because
    <br>the smell that came out from the infection was too terrible for anyone to bear.
    <br>Even my family members - most of them avoided me
    <br>but here I am; today, I am healed!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>I can now associate with my friends;
    <br>I even play football with my friends and everyone is happy.
    <br>My name is Mrs Philomena Ugan.
    <br>I'm from Cross River State.
    <br>The young man on my right is my son.
    <br>The problem that brought us here was skin disease
    <br>described by the doctor as fungal infection.
    <br>The problem started when my son was five years old
    <br>and I nursed him with that sickness for ten years.
    <br>Throughout the period of the sickness, I could not even think of having another child because
    <br>I was nursing him like a baby.
    <br>I took him from place to place, carrying him on my back.
    <br>I took him to the teaching hospital in my state and drugs were prescribed for him.
    <br>The strongest drug that treats fungal infections, lamicil was prescribed for him.
    <br>The doctor told me that two months after the prescription, my son would be well.
    <br>I gave him that drug for six years but nothing happened.
    <br>They asked me to go to another state.
    <br>I went to Benue State Hospital, where such diseases are treated.
    <br>When I took my son there, all the doctors there came to a round table;
    <br>they brought out my son, looked at his illness and told me,
    <br>"Madam, if you have given your son lamicil and he is not healed,
    <br>we don't think there is any other thing we can do for you."
    <br>I came out of the hospital with tears in my eyes and I still carried my son on my back like a baby.
    <br>Then, one of my friends told me that there was a herbalist who could treat this disease.
    <br>I took my son there.
    <br>They even gave him marks on his body;
    <br>there was nothing they didn't do to him but the rashes and the pain increased
    <br>and we were all disappointed.
    <br>We didn't know what to do.
    <br>After that, I went into my neighbour's room and I saw them watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw the wonderful things that God was using the man of God and the wise men
    <br>to do for people who had similar conditions to my son.
    <br>That was how I brought him to Lagos.
    <br>By the grace of God, we were located and placed at the prayer line.
    <br>At the prayer line, wise man Daniel came and touched him
    <br>and I saw my son getting up and walking on his own out of this place.
    <br>Since then, up till now, it has been healing and deliverance in my family!
    <br>Within that period of his illness, I lost so many things.
    <br>My job was at stake.
    <br>I was even dropped as head of unit and my junior was chosen to head the unit
    <br>because I could not concentrate.
    <br>I could not even concentrate as a housewife, to take care of my husband
    <br>and other domestic activities.
    <br>All my concentration was on him because for ten years, I washed him, I bathed him,
    <br>I washed his clothes and I fed him.
    <br>I did virtually everything for him.
    <br>He couldn't go to school or do anything.
    <br>I was even hiding him from some of my friends because of the odour
    <br>and the pain he was experiencing.
    <br>It was all over his skin to the extent that he could not even wear clothes.
    <br>I was always next to him, fanning him because the pain was making him hot.
    <br>I really suffered as a mother; there was nothing I didn't do to get him healed.
    <br>It was not until I came to The SCOAN, that a smile returned to my family.
    <br>Today, as you can see, my son is healed, to the glory of God!
    <br>Glory be to Jesus.
    <br>Master Ugan Alphonsus testified that after suffering for eight years
    <br>from the horrific problem of skin disease,
    <br>he is now healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The skin on the bottom of his feet and the palms of his hands is no longer afflicted with the skin disease,
    <br>but rather has been completely renewed and restored.
    <br>There is no pain; I feel no pain.
    <br>- No pain?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Master Ugan Alphonsus walks along The SCOAN prayer line,
    <br>encouraging the faith of those who have come with problems similar to the one he once had.
    <br>The young man shows the people the bottoms of his feet and the palms of his hands,
    <br>as proof that he has been miraculously healed and set free from the problem of skin disease,
    <br>which he had suffered from for eight years.
    <br>My advice to people here at the prayer line is that
    <br>when the wise man comes to pray for you, you have to believe
    <br>that as he prays for you, in Jesus' name, you are going to receive your healing and so it shall be.
    <br>When you leave this place after the wise man prays for you,
    <br>you will see that gradually, you will start receiving your healing and
    <br>everything will be OK; your problem will be solved.
    <br>You will feel very happy and light.
    <br>From there, you can continue your normal lives and live happily ever after.
    <br>Amen. That's wonderful advice,
    <br>that we should believe in Jesus Christ
    <br>and as we believe in Jesus Christ, He will take us out of our sickness and into good health.
    <br>He will take us out of our problem and into divine solution.
    <br>Now, I am in the second year at university, studying Political Science
    <br>and I am one of the best in my department.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>We rejoice with you at what Jesus Christ has done in your life.
    <br>We just want to advise you that as you have been healed by Christ's Word,
    <br>you should also be ruled by that Word, so that your healing will be permanent,
    <br>in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for my life.
