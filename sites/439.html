    <br>WARNING! The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers,
    <br>it is for the glory of God.
    <br>This man makes his way to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations hopping on one leg.
    <br>He makes use of a walking stick which he uses to aid his mobility.
    <br>He sits down after a hard struggle.
    <br>Why is he here?
    <br>A foot ulcer due to a gun shot.
    <br>This is the problem that has brought him to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>The top of his leg gives an idea of the condition his skin is in.
    <br>The camera pans down his leg
    <br>and on his foot it reveals unbroken skin and the ghastly open wound.
    <br>This is the foot ulcer that has hindered his ability to walk,
    <br>and is the cause of the pain and discomfort he has been enduring on a daily basis.
    <br>It oozes blood and pus, and has broken down layers of the skin.
    <br>We can see the discolouration of the surrounding skin, which has become darkened and black.
    <br>The condition of the foot ulcer is so terrible that he is unable to bear weight on his foot.
    <br>Hence the reason for his hopping in with the walking stick.
    <br>As a result of the ulcer, the foot has become swollen, rendering him unable to wear shoes.
    <br>Satan is the author of sickness and affliction.
    <br>His diseases are thieves of time, money, effort and joy.
    <br>Imagine a young man in this condition unable to work or fend for himself.
    <br>His problem has defied all medical solution,
    <br>and The Synagogue Church Of All Nations is his final hope, his last bus stop.
    <br>He has come with the belief that no one is hopeless whose hope is in the Lord.
    <br>He is in need of a radical transformation that only Jesus can give.
    <br>He sits pitifully holding up his placard.
    <br>Let us hear from him.
    <br>My name is Mr Anietie Patrick Benson.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.
    <br>I am 28 years old.
    <br>I have a foot ulcer due to a gunshot
    <br>and I am using a walking stick.
    <br>It has affected me. Since this happened, I cannot walk.
    <br>There is always pain and I cannot walk well since this happened.
    <br>I feel very bad.
    <br>I have been to herbalists; they could not treat it.
    <br>I went to one hospital and they moved me to another one.
    <br>There was no solution.
    <br>We see your walking aid with you. What do you use it for?
    <br>I use it to walk because of the problem I have.
    <br>I cannot walk fine without using the walking stick.
    <br>I believe Jesus will heal me!
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>At The SCOAN prayer line Prophet TB Joshua prays for Mr Benson, in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>and he begins to move against his will.
    <br>Hallelujah! He has been set free!
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>After his healing, some time later, Mr Benson came back to The SCOAN to share his testimony.
    <br>What is impossible for man is clearly possible for Jesus Christ.
    <br>A steadfast look at the crucified One will never look in vain at the Great Physician.
    <br>Yes, this is the same man after his healing on the right hand side of the screen.
    <br>Mr Benson has come back to show the world
    <br>that truly there is hope in that name Jesus Christ - the Master Healer.
    <br>On the left shows when he had first come to The SCOAN suffering from the problem of a foot ulcer.
    <br>On the right the wound of the ulcer has completely closed up. It reveals fresh, new skin.
    <br>And look, there is no swelling, no more pain, no more discomfort.
    <br>When Jesus Christ heals us, He heals us effectually, He heals us completely.
    <br>Who else could justly do it?
    <br>It is none other than our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Tap it.
    <br>Are you feeling pain?
    <br>No, I am not feeling pain.
    <br>Rub it.
    <br>Are you feeling pain?
    <br>No, I am not feeling pain.
    <br>Stamp it on the floor.
    <br>Are you feeling any pain at all?
    <br>No, I am not feeling any pain at all.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>HEALING: Horrific Gunshot Wound!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Anietie Patrick Benson.
    <br>I came from Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was a foot ulcer.
    <br>Armed robbers came to my house and shot me.
    <br>That was the reason I came here.
    <br>They booked me for an operation.
    <br>The first doctor operated on the leg.
    <br>About one week later, they transferred me to Uyo Teaching Hospital.
    <br>I could not walk by myself. Without a walking stick, I could not move.
    <br>It affected my business; I could not go to my business. I could not do anything.
    <br>The worst part is that the leg began to smell.
    <br>My friends could not come close to me.
    <br>During that time I did not feel comfortable with my life.
    <br>At The SCOAN, they put me on the prayer line,
    <br>and the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, prayed for me and since that day, I am well.
    <br>I can walk well without a walking stick.
    <br>After about one week, I went to the hospital to show the doctors
    <br>and they were all doubting, asking how it had happened.
    <br>Right now, can you show the people of God? They can't wait to see what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>We want to see the condition of the leg.
    <br>We can see you wearing shoes now. Were you able to wear shoes then?
    <br>No, I could not wear anything at that time.
    <br>This is the leg.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the Master Healer.
    <br>Indeed our God is an awesome God.
    <br>He remains the same yesterday, today and forever. He has never failed.
    <br>I am free. I am okay. I can do anything now.
    <br>I can play football and wear my shoes.
    <br>HEALING: Horrific Gunshot Wound!
    <br>My advise is that any problem you have, just have faith in God,
    <br>that when you come to God, God will do it for you.
    <br>My promise to God is that I will sin no more and I will serve Him with my life.
    <br>We thank God and we know that God will give you the grace to continue to serve Him,
    <br>to continue to stand up for Him,
    <br>and we know Jesus Christ will continue to be your Lord and personal Saviour,
    <br>as you continue to make His Word the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
