  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise the living Jesus!
    <br>If you want the Lord to rain His power of blessing and healing over you,
    <br>wave your hand and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus, for Your mercy, for Your favour, for Your undeserved grace".
    <br>Put your hands together and wave your hand and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Yes, His grace has brought us this far.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and say, "Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul".
    <br>Yes, once again: You are welcome to the presence of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may have your seat in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Yinka.
    <br>I want to begin by asking you:
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>Fine.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>But do you know that how you feel does not really matter;
    <br>what matters most is what the Word of God says about you.
    <br>If you feel you are not too fine, I want you to know
    <br>that the part of you that is hurt is just a shell; the real you is just fine
    <br>because the position of Jesus Christ in your life is peace and comfort,
    <br>because Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes.
    <br>For those who are seated by the highway of life, worrying about tomorrow,
    <br>despairing about life's uncertainties, murmuring about the vicissitudes of life,
    <br>I have good news for you!
    <br>For those who are worried about what will be the next step of life, I have good news for you.
    <br>We serve a God who oftentimes brings good out of evil and promotes the design of His providence,
    <br>even by the sin of man.
    <br>When you read your Bible from Genesis to Revelation, you will understand this truth
    <br>and the mystery of how God uses unpleasant circumstances to uncover His mighty grace,
    <br>mighty promise in the lives of His people.
    <br>When you read your Bible in the Book of Genesis 37,
    <br>the Bible says that God overruled the evil designs of Joseph's brothers
    <br>in order to serve His purpose of making him an instrument to save many people.
    <br>This means it was God's will and purpose for him to be sold into slavery.
    <br>When you open your Bible also to the Book of Exodus 2, you will agree with me
    <br>that it was predestined that Moses - one of the great warriors in the Bible - be left by the sea
    <br>as a baby, live in Egypt and be adopted as a son to the princess of Pharaoh
    <br>in order to redeem the Israelites.
    <br>Remember, if the circumstances surrounding his birth had been normal,
    <br>there might not have been reason for him to be taken to Egypt
    <br>where he finally became a blessing to his nation, Israel.
    <br>This implies that God's divine wisdom tends to contradict the course,
    <br>I mean the ways of natural events.
    <br>I don't know what you are going through, brethren,
    <br>but what I do know is that God speaks strength and courage through our darkest hours.
    <br>God speaks strength and courage through our darkest moments.
    <br>And this brings me to the title of today's message.
    <br>DISCOVER THE MYSTERY OF GRACE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Discover the mystery of grace".
    <br>Many today have changed the course of events, failing to discover the mystery
    <br>behind their situation.
    <br>Many have changed the course of history, failing to discover the mystery behind their situation.
    <br>We fail to realise that God is building character now.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be passing through, God is building character
    <br>so that when we get to a place of destiny, we do not explode and lose it all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>1 Corinthians 1:27 says God has chosen the foolish things of this world to put to shame the wise,
    <br>and God has chosen the weak things of this world to put to shame the things which are mighty.
    <br>The Bible says that God works most wisely and most powerfully in a way
    <br>directly opposite to human expectations.
    <br>The deep gap between human and divine ways is evident throughout human history.
    <br>Let's turn our Bible to the Book of Judges 11
    <br>and that will be our main proof text today.
    <br>I believe this story of Jephthah will bless your life today.
    <br>Let's open our Bible to the Book of Judges 11.
    <br>It is all about a man called Jephthah, the man who had given up on life
    <br>but God made his trouble to work for his advancement.
    <br>God made his trouble, his pain, his rejection, his isolation to work for his advancement.
    <br>Now let's turn quickly with me to the Book of Judges 11.
    <br>"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was the son of a harlot;
    <br>and Gilead begot Jephthah.
    <br>Gilead's wife bore sons; and when his wife's sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out,
    <br>and said to him, 'You shall have no inheritance in our father's house,
    <br>for you are the son of another woman.'
    <br>Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob;
    <br>and worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out raiding with him.
    <br>It came to pass after a time that the people of Ammon made war against Israel.
    <br>And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel
    <br>that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
    <br>Then they said to Jephthah, 'Come and be our commander, that we may fight
    <br>against the people of Ammon.' "
    <br>Remember, this was a man that was rejected.
    <br>"So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, 'Did you not hate me, and expel me from my father's house?
    <br>Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?'
    <br>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, 'That is why we have turned again to you now,
    <br>that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon,
    <br>and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.'
    <br>So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, 'If you take me back home to fight against
    <br>the people of Ammon, and the Lord delivers them to me, shall I be your head?'
    <br>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, 'The Lord will be a witness between us,
    <br>if we do not do according to your words.'
    <br>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head
    <br>and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord in Mizpah'."
    <br>This was the man that was sent out
    <br>and finally became the commander-in-chief of the armed forces -
    <br>this is the mystery of grace.
    <br>When you read the story of Jephthah, you will agree with me
    <br>that the affliction of the saints promotes their fruitfulness, even by the sin of man -
    <br>this is the mystery of grace.
    <br>The Bible made us to understand that circumstances beyond his control forced him out
    <br>into a life of an outcast.
    <br>Remember, broken things become useful in the hands of God.
    <br>What is your situation, brethren?
    <br>Are you rejected or disappointed?
    <br>Are you abandoned?
    <br>Always remember the case of Jephthah.
    <br>It is important for us to know and be encouraged
    <br>that there is an unseen hand of God that controls the affairs of man;
    <br>that unseen hand is the divine driver of our fortunes.
    <br>Are you in pain and you don't know what life brings?
    <br>Are you worried about your many troubles?
    <br>Always remember that there is an unseen hand of God that controls the affairs of your life;
    <br>that unseen hand is the divine driver of your fortunes.
    <br>The case of Jephthah is an example of the rise of a man from rejection to prominence.
    <br>As the child of a prostitute, an illegitimate son, he was sent out of his father's house;
    <br>he was ridiculed, homeless and abandoned.
    <br>But that did not stop the promise of God in his life
    <br>because he kept the depth of his relationship with God.
    <br>All the pain and suffering that he went through did not stop the promise of God
    <br>because he kept the depth of his relationship with God.
    <br>God chooses what we go through but we choose how we go through it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Regardless of my situation, regardless of my circumstances,
    <br>I know God is still saying something.
    <br>Regardless of my situation, regardless of my pain and suffering, God is still saying something".
    <br>God chooses what we go through but we choose how we go through it.
    <br>Jephthah could have allowed distractions, temptation, tests and trials
    <br>to stop him from reaching his goal, thereby changing the history today.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing, I want you to know one thing:
    <br>No mortal man or devil can supersede the plan of God for your life.
    <br>But there is only one person that can get you out of the will of God - and that is you.
    <br>There is no mortal man or devil that can supersede the plan of God, the will of God for your life.
    <br>But there is only one person that can take you out of the will of God - and that is you.
    <br>What you give your attention to can either keep you in the will of God or take you out of it.
    <br>When trials, tests, temptation, persecution and name-calling come,
    <br>always remember that what you give your attention to,
    <br>the way you respond to your trials can keep you out of the will of God
    <br>or keep you in the will of God.
    <br>Today, if you are ready to put your problems, your worries, anxiety in the hands of God,
    <br>He will put His peace in your heart.
    <br>Remember, His peace passes all understanding.
    <br>It does not matter how many times you have failed in life.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, it does not matter the amount of times you have been rejected.
    <br>It does not matter how many years you have waited for your miracle.
    <br>But one thing is sure:
    <br>The unpleasant circumstances that you may be passing through may seem foolish
    <br>to the carnally minded but they are as it should be.
    <br>They are as it should be according to the design of God, to bring the best out of you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My unpleasant situation is to bring the best out of me. The best is yet to come!"
    <br>Brethren, this is the mystery of grace.
    <br>Message Title:
    <br>DISCOVER THE MYSTERY OF GRACE
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the same God that made Jephthah's trouble to work for his advancement,
    <br>as from today, your trouble will begin to work for your advancement, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>as God made Jepthah's trouble to work for his advancement,
    <br>your trouble will begin to work for your advancement, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever barrier that may be standing between you and God's promises
    <br>shall be broken today, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>God knows that we are weak and that is why He made His grace available to us.
    <br>If God were to consider works, rather than grace,
    <br>I know there would be no room for the weak, like you and me.
    <br>If God were to consider works, rather than grace,
    <br>there would be no room for the weak, like you and me.
    <br>Let someone say, "Grace is undeserved favour".
    <br>Grace is undeserved favour.
    <br>Today, too many people think that the primary requirement for serving God
    <br>is the gift of spoken language - oratory - high qualifications and impressive credentials.
    <br>But you know Peter and the other disciples were ordinary fishermen
    <br>from a backward and lowly part of the society.
    <br>They were unnoticed, they were uncelebrated and in obscurity
    <br>until Jesus called them and made them fit for His service.
    <br>There is hope. Cheer up.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, youth all around the world, there is hope.
    <br>Jesus is the hope!
    <br>Are you educated or uneducated?
    <br>Are you a farmer or a professor?
    <br>Stop talking about your limitation.
    <br>Start loving God with all your heart, knowing that He watches over you.
    <br>If you hope to achieve anything great in the future,
    <br>it will only be as a result of your love for God.
    <br>Remember, the Book of Romans 8:28 says all things work together for them that love God.
    <br>I mean, the way and manner that God created the world is for the good of His children.
    <br>So rejoice, for no condition is permanent.
    <br>Don't forget that God has purposely kept us in the dark concerning future events
    <br>so that we can always be alert, watchful and prayerful.
    <br>Maybe you are asking yourself, will you look at the old scenario,
    <br>from the angle of common sense, you may ask, "Is she asking I should not pray
    <br>and just rely on the grace? I shouldn't work?"
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>Work hard.
    <br>Work because God will still have to mark your work, brethren.
    <br>It is true hard work works.
    <br>Work as if everything depends on you but pray as if everything depends on God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Discover the mystery of grace".
    <br>I discover the mystery of grace.
    <br>Finally, brethren, let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Ephesians
    <br>and let's hear the word of exhortation from Apostle Paul to each and every one of us.
    <br>Let us open our Bibles to the Book of Ephesians 1,
    <br>and let us take our reading from verse 3 quickly.
    <br>"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
    <br>just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
    <br>that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love.
    <br>In Him we have redemption through His blood,
    <br>the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace
    <br>which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
    <br>having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure
    <br>which He purposed in Himself,
    <br>that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times
    <br>He might gather together in one all things in Christ,
    <br>both which are in heaven and which are on earth in Him.
    <br>In Him also we have obtained an inheritance,
    <br>being predestined according to the purpose of Him
    <br>who works all things according to the counsel of His will."
    <br>Let someone say, "I have obtained an inheritance today!"
    <br>I have obtained an inheritance today - through His will.
    <br>This is the mystery of grace - that God takes the unlikely people, like you and me,
    <br>and places them in His palace for eternity.
    <br>So, stop wallowing in self-pity.
    <br>Rise up on your feet and give all thanks to God and do not allow your pain, your worry,
    <br>your lack of education to weigh you down.
    <br>Remember, God takes the unlikely people, like you and me,
    <br>and puts them in His palace for eternity.
    <br>Remember, God freely gives His grace to those who rely on His strength.
    <br>God gives His grace to those who rely on His Word and His Word says,
    <br>"I will not keep you away from tests and trials, but I will see you through them".
    <br>To uncover the mystery behind your situation
    <br>learn to control your character if you cannot control your circumstances.
    <br>When you are going through the heat of life and you do not know what tomorrow might bring forth
    <br>or you have been lied against or you have been rejected,
    <br>learn to control your character, your attitude if you cannot control your circumstances.
    <br>Remember, we will not be judged by the colour of our skin but by the content of our character,
    <br>because a real Christian depends on God's grace and puts his trust in Christ alone for salvation.
    <br>It is this grace that gives us hope that no matter the situation, the best is yet to come!
    <br>Are you oppressed? Remember, grace in condemnation is comfort.
    <br>Are you sick? Remember, grace in sickness is good health.
    <br>Are you overwhelmed with burdens? Grace in yoke is freedom.
    <br>If that grace could be sufficient for Joseph in the prison,
    <br>if it could be sufficient for Moses, for Jephthah,
    <br>it will be sufficient for you today, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>That grace will be sufficient for you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember, grace means "not by power and not by might".
    <br>Therefore, God is the unseen hand that reveals in the mystery of His grace.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
