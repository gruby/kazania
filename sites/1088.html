  <p>    
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for individuals in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the evidence of God's mighty presence is clear.
    <br>The people move and fall against their will under the mighty anointing of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Everything that was in the dark is exposed,
    <br>including the demons operating in their lives.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am her ancestors!
    <br>I am the ancestral spirit of the family.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>He is the one that disturbs me!
    <br>I want to fight him; I am after him.
    <br>Him and his Jesus...
    <br>I am going to kill her!
    <br>I entered her since she was a baby; she is mine!
    <br>I want to fight you!
    <br>I control her and I will control her all her life!
    <br>I control her through her thoughts.
    <br>She will never succeed!
    <br>They tried to deliver her but we will never let her go. She belongs to me; she belongs to us.
    <br>She is part of us!
    <br>I made her do immoral things; I torment her!
    <br>Day and night, I torment her when she is praying.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua delivers the woman in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>casting out the evil spirit behind all her afflictions.
    <br>She is free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>From French Guiana Living In France
    <br>She said her name is Carina. She is living in Paris, France. She is originally from French Guiana.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>As you saw it on the video, I'm here to give a testimony for the glory of God,
    <br>for what He has done in my life.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that everything started in her life when she was around five to six years old.
    <br>In the family she is coming from, they used to perform some rituals and they used to do it for herself.
    <br>They would prepare some concoction and put it in some water and liquid.
    <br>They would then be bathing her with that concoction and liquid,
    <br>be washing her body but she never knew what the purpose of these rituals was.
    <br>She said that when she was eight to nine years old, she moved from French Guiana to Paris, France.
    <br>When she was 15 years old, she decided to go back to French Guiana
    <br>and that is how the spirit started manifesting within her.
    <br>She started developing that spirit of lust towards men.
    <br>She said that any man she would be looking at, as soon as they had eye contact,
    <br>the man would be following her to be sleeping with her.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that at that time when she was 15 years old and she went back to French Guiana,
    <br>she started sleeping with so many men in one year
    <br>that she can't even count how many men she was sleeping with in that one year
    <br>because she was having this spirit of lust that was controlling her.
    <br>She said that when she went back to Paris, France, one year later,
    <br>it even became worse. She started going to nightclubs, dancing, smoking and drinking
    <br>and sleeping with different men. With those she had an eye contact with, she would be sleeping with them.
    <br>She started living this life of immorality.
    <br>There is a tradition in her country, French Guiana, where you join a group of carnival
    <br>and you would be wearing a mask and be dancing.
    <br>She joined this group when she went back to Paris, France.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that this is the kind of group that she joined.
    <br>We can see those people wearing masks, like a masquerade group.
    <br>She said that in joining them, she would be like possessed and be dancing with men.
    <br>There would be eye contact as they could only see each other's eyes.
    <br>At the end of the day, the only thing after that would just be sleeping with men.
    <br>Joining this kind of group was very funny.
    <br>It is now that she realised that she was really possessed.
    <br>She said that during the week, she could be very sick and down.
    <br>But when it was time to wear this kind of mask and attire and she put the mask on,
    <br>the sickness would just vanish and she would feel very well and strong
    <br>to perform these kind of rituals and at the end of the day, she would be sleeping with many men.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So she said that she became like a princess in the nightclub.
    <br>At a time when she went to nightclubs, they would know her so well.
    <br>She didn't pay for anything anymore. She would be drinking and smoking for free.
    <br>They would be giving her things. All the men would be coming around her.
    <br>She can't count how many men she has been sleeping with.
    <br>She said that the kind of men she used to meet, she knows that they are occult men.
    <br>Many at times they were like demons because she always met them at night.
    <br>Even when she was about to sleep with them, it would always be in the dark.
    <br>They didn't want the light to be on. It would always be in the dark.
    <br>They would be asking her to do so many different things.
    <br>Some would be asking her to be urinating on them, masturbating them
    <br>or using some objects to be sleeping with them.
    <br>That demon made her to do a lot of different things that naturally, a normal human being would not do.
    <br>She realised that it was really a life of immorality that she was living.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>That spirit even made her to be sleeping with men that maybe, she would be attracted to
    <br>and even with men that she would not even think of looking at -
    <br>men she would not even be attracted to and she would be sleeping with them,
    <br>to tell you that that spirit would choose whoever she would be sleeping with.
    <br>Whoever would be coming her way, she would be sleeping with them.
    <br>She said that this really affected her, to the point that she even met a man one day
    <br>that introduced her to sleeping with another woman.
    <br>That was how she started having an attraction towards women.
    <br>But that day, that man introduced her to sleeping with another woman.
    <br>That is how the spirit has really destroyed her life.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>That spirit even caused her to pierce her neck.
    <br>She was having a piercing at her neck, her nose and the lower part of her lips.
    <br>If God had not rescued her, she would be having a lot of piercings all over her body.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that that spirit even made her to have different kinds of hairstyles -
    <br>red style, shaved at the side, different kinds of styles that any normal human being wouldn't have
    <br>like she would sometimes look like a chicken.
    <br>This evil spirit would make her to do different kinds of hairstyles.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that because of this problem, she was seeing that she was really falling down.
    <br>She was used to those rituals that they used to do to her when she was small
    <br>so she was consulting witchdoctors, different seers to get a solution to her problem
    <br>and they would be giving her different concoctions to drink, things to use on her body,
    <br>and different things to be doing. At the end of the day, she would even become worse and worse
    <br>in the immorality she was living.
    <br>Can you explain to us now - how did you get to know about The SCOAN
    <br>and now come to receive your deliverance?
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that when she saw that this problem had brought different kinds of problems into her life -
    <br>she was into debt, she was not suceeding professionally,
    <br>everything was not working around her, she was really in the dark -
    <br>she started watching Emmanuel TV after she had discovered Emmanuel TV on the internet.
    <br>She started praying with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and she realised she needed to come to receive her deliverance.
    <br>So when you came and the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed for you, what happened?
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So she said that when the man of God was coming towards her to pray for her,
    <br>before he even came in front of her, she was feeling a sensation, vibration in her body.
    <br>When the man of God touched her, she really felt...
    <br>She saw on the video how she reacted and she said that she really realised
    <br>how satan had been using her, had been living in her body and had been destroying her life.
    <br>She realised that really those rituals they used to do for her when she was small
    <br>were transmitted to her from generation to generation as the spirit said he was an ancestral spirit.
    <br>She said that after the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, touched her
    <br>and the spirit manifested, she is now feeling so free and fine.
    <br>Let's clap our hands for our Lord Jesus Christ for what God has done in the life of this lady!
    <br>So now that you are feeling free and so fine, can you tell us -
    <br>do you still have the desire to sleep with men as you look around,
    <br>do you still have that eye contact? All those bad dreams you used to have, are they still there?
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that she is totally free. She doesn't have any desire to sleep with any man.
    <br>She doesn't have any desire to drink or smoke.
    <br>No more bad dreams. She is completely free for the glory of God.
    <br>Let's clap our hands for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>She has been removed from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light
    <br>and we give thanks to God for her life today.
    <br>For what the Lord has done in your life, what is the advice you have
    <br>for young ladies, young people like you that may be facing the same kind of situation
    <br>and don't know how to go about it?
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said she has three advices for people.
    <br>First of all, she would like to advice young ladies, especially coming from the islands.
    <br>When you are going to a traditional dance or things like a carnival,
    <br>don't see it as something very light as there is a spirit behind it -
    <br>a spirit that will possess you to go and do those hidden vices.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that she also wants to tell young ladies - that is her second advice -
    <br>that sometimes, don't let the mirror deceive you.
    <br>Don't believe that maybe because you are beautiful and well made -
    <br>without our Lord Jesus Christ, this beauty is nothing.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Her third advice is also for young people:
    <br>All these social media - please get free from these social media.
    <br>Many a times there are spirits behind it that will possess you.
    <br>You will find yourself doing what you don't want to do.
    <br>So please, be careful of social media. So these are the three advices she has.
    <br>We pray with her that God Almighty will give her the grace to maintain that deliverance she received
    <br>in making God's Word the standard for her life, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Ms Carina
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel! So she said that she wants to thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>for the love he showed to her, for the hospitality, for allowing her to stay one more week
    <br>and being in the presence of God and being able to give this testimony today.
    <br>She wants to tell everybody: Please, the Lord is not far from you.
    <br>He is just behind the door; you just need to open that door for Him to step in
    <br>and He will do the same thing He has done for me in your life, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's clap our hands for our Lord Jesus Christ!
