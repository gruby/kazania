  <p>    
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The atmosphere here is charged.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>That is the right atmosphere to operate - atmosphere of faith.
    <br>Are you connected?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Let me just talk to you about this:
    <br>EVERYONE HAS BEEN TEMPTED
    <br>That you are born again does not mean you cannot make a mistake.
    <br>People make mistakes.
    <br>Even if you are a Christian, you are going to make mistakes.
    <br>The difference between you and others -
    <br>you already have a relationship with God.
    <br>You should know that since you have a relationship with Him,
    <br>you can immediately go to God about your behaviour,
    <br>"Jesus, this is what I have done. This is what has happened to me. Please, Jesus",
    <br>and He will help you get back on your feet and forgive you
    <br>and help you not to make the same decision again.
    <br>Can you see the difference now?
    <br>Everyone has been tempted.
    <br>You have been tempted; I have been tempted.
    <br>We will continue to be challenged with issues that violate our conscience,
    <br>that disturb our conscience.
    <br>What are those issues?
    <br>The greatest war is in our hearts.
    <br>"I don't want to smoke again. I don't want to look at it.
    <br>No, I said I didn't like this thing."
    <br>We will continue to be challenged with issues that violate our conscience,
    <br>issues that disturb you as a Christian.
    <br>You may be going and notice what you do not want to see...
    <br>When you look around, you see corruption.
    <br>You look to your left, you see killing,
    <br>at your back you see mismanagement and all others everywhere.
    <br>And you cannot continue closing your eyes while walking on the street.
    <br>It is not possible, you have to open your eyes.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You will continue to be challenged with issues that violate your conscience."
    <br>Let's turn to that Romans 3:10.
    <br>"As it is written: 'There is none righteous, no, not one.' "
    <br>We all face temptation to do the wrong thing.
    <br>Glory be to God, there is a way.
    <br>Jesus is the Way!
    <br>You can receive the courage through Him,
    <br>strength and conviction to hold your ground.
    <br>You say, "No. I am not going to do that. I reject it. I rebuke it."
    <br>You can only get this courage from whom?
    <br>Through whom?
    <br>No one can do right, say the truth or say yes to the truth without Jesus.
    <br>You can receive the courage, strength and conviction to hold your ground,
    <br>to say. "No! This is the right thing to do. No, I am not going to do that."
    <br>You can say, "Yes, I can do it, if you can do it."
    <br>To say that - that courage can come through Christ.
    <br>"No, I cannot do it" - if you cannot do it -
    <br>that courage can only come through Christ.
    <br>"I will help you" - if you can -
    <br>that kind of language can only come through Jesus,
    <br>when you give your life to Jesus Christ and make Him you Boss and your CEO, in all you do.
    <br>How do we know that you have made Jesus CEO, your Boss?
    <br>You can know when you begin to think differently.
    <br>When change comes to your life,
    <br>you will be directed by your Heavenly Father, not by the influence of others.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>"I am born again."
    <br>How do you know you are born again?
    <br>We can know, you don't need to tell us.
    <br>Some people will say, "I am born again".
    <br>I will say, "Do you need to tell me you are born again?"
    <br>I can read it in your life, future.
    <br>That is hypocrisy.
    <br>"I am born again. I gave my life to Jesus over ten years ago" - you continue to deceive yourself.
    <br>You don't need to tell us this; your life will read it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Read me!"
    <br>One thing we don't know:
    <br>Broken things become useful in God's hands.
    <br>There is no one Jesus cannot turn around,
    <br>no matter what you might have done, or where you are coming from.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Broken things become useful in God's hands."
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>Don't be 'too forward'.
    <br>No matter where you are coming from, how dirty you are, how foolish you are,
    <br>broken things become useful in God's hands.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>Your life will go smoother when you go by the Book.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My life will run smoother when I go by the Book."
    <br>How will I know I am born again?
    <br>Is it by word of mouth?
    <br>When you are born again, you think differently, you dream differently,
    <br>you have a sensitivity that you never had.
    <br>You have the privilege of letting your Creator assist you in all you do.
    <br>"I want to do this, I want to carry the book" -
    <br>if I am born again and I want to carry this book,
    <br>I can call on my Creator to assist me to carry it,
    <br>because if I carry it on my own, I will fail.
    <br>I want to carry the book - "In Jesus' name. Amen" - He will join me to carry it; me and my Creator.
    <br>You and Him are cooperating.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You and Him are cooperating."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>If you people do not cooperate, you will continue to fail.
    <br>If I tell you to get it right, when you get to a certain level you will fall down.
    <br>You and Him are cooperating - that is what we call 'born again'.
    <br>You have the privilege of letting the Creator assist you in all you do.
    <br>"I want to carry this book, in Jesus' name."
    <br>If I am born again truly, I will say, "Jesus Christ, help me. I want to carry this book."
    <br>If He does not want me to carry this book, He will tell me, "Don't carry it" - I will not bother to go there.
    <br>If He wants me to carry it, He will join me to carry it - then I want to carry the book.
    <br>We carry it together; I will not even feel it, I will not sweat and you will just see everything.
    <br>I mean...
    <br>Are you really born again?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you really born again?"
    <br>Your pain can prepare you for extraordinary service, if you are born again.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you are born again, your pain can prepare you for extraordinary service."
    <br>That is what we mean by 'born again."
    <br>That does not mean that if you are born again you will not have pain.
    <br>There will be pain but your pain will prepare you for extraordinary service.
    <br>What do I mean by pain?
    <br>It could be sickness, poverty...
    <br>A man may be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>It does not mean you cannot be poor.
    <br>A man may be sick and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Whatever you are passing through as 'a born again'
    <br>will only prepare you for extraordinary service.
    <br>The highest motive for serving God is the desire to please Him.
    <br>Your sickness should prepare you for extraordinary service.
    <br>You know what I mean by extraordinary.
    <br>The more that pain, the more your desire to serve God.
    <br>The more that situation in your life,
    <br>the more the desire to move closer to Him and to serve Him more.
    <br>If you are truly born again, the more the pain, the more the desire to serve Him.
    <br>What has happened to you today?
    <br>While your pain as a born again is a reason for you to serve Him the more,
    <br>likewise, your blessing is a reason for serving Him the more.
    <br>Because you can go to Him about your behaviour.
    <br>You misbehaved - you run to Him, because you have a relationship with Him.
    <br>You talk anyhow, you run to Him, "Jesus, I have talked anyhow."
    <br>If that is the case, satan will not tempt you again,
    <br>because he will realise that the more he tempts you, the more you go to God -
    <br>there is no need of temptation!
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>If that is the case, satan is losing because he tempted you to overthrow you,
    <br>he tempted you so that you could lose your post.
    <br>But instead; the more the temptation, the more your desire to God,
    <br>the more you press after Him, the more you move closer to Him.
    <br>Then, satan is losing - there is no need of temptation.
    <br>He will realise that tempting this man is wasting his time.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>What he wants to achieve is to separate you from your Creator.
    <br>The highest motive for serving God is the desire to please Him.
    <br>If you have not experienced God, there will be dissatisfaction,
    <br>a sense of hunger to know what life is all about,
    <br>a desire to know what happens after life is over.
    <br>When you don't have God, you begin to ask yourself, "What happens after life is over?
    <br>Six feet - where am I going?"
    <br>You don't know where you are going because you don't have God.
    <br>His protection is beyond the grave.
    <br>Everyone has been tempted.
    <br>As a Christian, the difference between you and others is that
    <br>you have a relationship with God.
    <br>You should know that immediately you misbehave,
    <br>you can go to Him about you behaviour and He will help you
    <br>to get back on your feet and will forgive you
    <br>and help you not to make the same mistake again.
    <br>Life continues.
    <br>But others...
    <br>Will you be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>Now, how do you know you are born again?
    <br>You know you are born again when everything becomes different -
    <br>you think differently because you are a changed person.
    <br>You are not directed by the influence of others
    <br>but you are directed by the influence of the Heavenly Father.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>You will think differently because you are a changed person, being directed
    <br>by your Heavenly Father, not by the influence of others.
    <br>But today, instead of you to trust in God's authority,
    <br>you trust so much in majority.
    <br>This is the life we live today.
    <br>You trust so much in majority.
    <br>Already, it is majority that confirms your vote - who to lead, who to rule -
    <br>that has been a part of the system of the world.
    <br>But as a Christian you should know: a personal decision - Christ is a majority.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>I know I am born again, you know you are born again
    <br>when you begin to think differently, dream differently.
    <br>When you begin to think differently...
    <br>The kind of dream you are having now - you don't understand your dream
    <br>and people don't know the meaning of dreaming.
    <br>What do you mean by dreaming?
    <br>As you are standing now, you can dream.
    <br>People think that until they close their eyes, until they lie on the bed, until they sleep...
    <br>You can be walking and dreaming.
    <br>You can be eating and dreaming.
    <br>It is not when you sleep.
    <br>People don't know the difference; what is dream, what is vision, what is mission.
    <br>They mixed up the whole thing.
    <br>Mission gives birth to vision.
    <br>It is like when you go to a big mall; there is a place they sell shoes,
    <br>a place they sell clothes, a place they sell attire.
    <br>Where are you going?
    <br>The whole mall is a mission.
    <br>When you enter a place with shoes, you are taking a vision - that is your vision there.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>That is why we say, "Christ's mission is my mission."
    <br>It is not flesh that dreams.
    <br>It is not your body that is dreaming.
    <br>It is the spirit.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>As a Christian - it is the spirit, but we don't know this.
    <br>When you become born again, you become a child of God
    <br>and you give your life to God, to Jesus Christ,
    <br>and you make Him your CEO, your Boss in all you do,
    <br>everything about you will look different, you will think differently.
    <br>When everybody is thinking this way, you think another way.
    <br>This is where you will have trouble with the world.
    <br>You say, "I don't want trouble" but the trouble will come.
    <br>How?
    <br>When people think this way and you think this way, and you insist this is a good way.
    <br>They will say, "This is a foolish man."
    <br>From there you become an enemy of the world.
    <br>Can you see? You are not inviting this - it comes naturally.
    <br>You are not inviting this but the thing comes naturally because of your vision and your mission.
    <br>Because you think differently because you are born again.
    <br>You dream differently, have a sensitivity that you never had -
    <br>the privilege of letting the Creator assist you.
    <br>You want to talk - before you talk, He will help you to talk.
    <br>You want to jump - before you jump, He will help you to jump.
    <br>You want to look, you say, "Jesus, I want to look" - He helps you to look.
    <br>This is why today you cannot compare yourself to others
    <br>because the Creator of Heaven and earth is assisting you.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>I mean, the Head of the immaterial world is assisting you.
    <br>The dividend of being born again is when the Creator of Heaven and earth begins to assist you.
    <br>That is the dividend.
    <br>Your dividend of democracy.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>That is the dividend.
    <br>When the Creator of Heaven and earth begins to assist you;
    <br>you want to sleep - He will assist you, 
    <br>you want to wake up - He assists you,
    <br>you want to talk - He assists you,
    <br>you want to sleep - He assists you,
    <br>you want to preach - He assists you,
    <br>you want to pray - He assists you.
    <br>You and Him are cooperating.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I and Christ Jesus are cooperating."
    <br>Immediately you are born again, you begin to pray according to His will;
    <br>you dance according to His will;
    <br>you look according to His will;
    <br>you talk to people according to His will.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by "by His will"?
    <br>When you begin to do this according to His will, it means you are under His supervision,
    <br>taking instructions from Him.
    <br>Then you can approach Him through the name.
    <br>You can have desire for Him but it is His own desire.
    <br>If your desire is genuine, His desire will be given to you.
    <br>Open your lips, ask Him to act in you so that your work may by holy.
    <br>Act in me, Lord.
    <br>Holy Spirit, act in me so that my work may be holy.
    <br>Lord Jesus, act in me so that my work may be holy.
    <br>Breathe in me, oh Holy Spirit.
    <br>Open your lips - prayer!
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>Strengthen me Lord so that I will defend what is holy.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I want you to take this, write it - the word 'born again'.
    <br>When you are born again, you have the privilege of letting the Creator assist you in all you do.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[When you are born again, you have the privilege of letting the Creator assist you in all you do.]
    <br>That is a fine definition for being born again.
    <br>Every other definition is under it - this is the primary definition.
    <br>Every other definition is secondary.
    <br>If the Creator does not assist you, how will you live right?
    <br>How will you maintain being born again?
    <br>No one can live holy without God's guidance.
    <br>No one can speak for Him without His instinct.
    <br>No one can continue to assist Him, support Him, live for Him without Him.
    <br>In this world, without faith and hope,
    <br>you cannot live right, you cannot defend what is right without Him.
    <br>Look at what the Bible says in the Book of Luke, "Behold, I have given you power
    <br>to walk freely among snakes, to walk freely among scorpions, to walk freely among..."
    <br>People will say, "If I stand" - no, you don't need to stand on them,
    <br>you don't need to stamp on them, march on them - no.
    <br>What the Bible is saying is to walk freely, because you are among scorpions and snakes.
    <br>Everywhere you turn to - when you leave here to your working place -
    <br>spirit of snake everywhere.
    <br>They give you food, money.
    <br>Some people will take money from 'blood place', from ritual and will give you - you don't know
    <br>but because you were given power to walk freely among them...
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>That is what I am talking about.
    <br>When you are born again, you have the privilege of letting the Creator assist you in all you do.
    <br>It means you walk freely among the snakes, scorpions, lions.
    <br>You will be walking among them like this; they will be looking at you,
    <br>"Which kind of man is this?"
    <br>They cannot touch you, they will be only looking at you.
    <br>The Bible does not mean 'march' - it means 'walk, live, look, dance freely among them'
    <br>and nothing, by any means will...
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again, "How do you know you are born again?"
    <br>You are born again when you have the privilege of letting the Creator
    <br>assist you in all you do.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>Ask your neighbour a question now, "Are you truly born again?"
    <br>Take note, when you are born again, you will receive the courage,
    <br>strength and conviction to hold your ground.
    <br>When you move like this, nothing can shake me.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>When you know where you are going, you don't need to fear.
    <br>When you know Jesus is going with you, you don't need to fear.
    <br>Why are you afraid?
    <br>You need not fear where you are going - tell your neighbour -
    <br>when you know Jesus is going with you.
    <br>Draw me nearer
    <br>Nearer to Thee
    <br>Lord
    <br>Draw me nearer

    <br>Draw me nearer

    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Ask Him once again to strengthen your desire and determination for Him.
    <br>Your desire is to do His will.
    <br>Your highest motive to serve Him is to please Him.
    <br>Father, strengthen my desire and determination for You alone.
    <br>Let my will be Your will and let Your will be my will.
    <br>Give me the grace to cooperate with You in all I do.
    <br>Give me the grace to cooperate with You; I want to cooperate with You.
    <br>I want to cooperate with You.
    <br>I want to submit.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>My song everyday 
    <br>Father draw me nearer
    <br>Draw me nearer

    <br>Lord
    <br>My song everyday 
    <br>Father draw me nearer
    <br>Draw me nearer
    <br>Nearer to Thee
    <br>Today, we are in His presence asking for the grace.
    <br>There is a bond between you and God because He is your Creator.
    <br>There is a bond between me and God because He is my Creator.
    <br>So I am asking for this bond again, the renewal of this bond.
    <br>Open your lips - prayer.
    <br>My song everyday 
    <br>Father draw me nearer
    <br>Draw me nearer
    <br>Nearer to Thee
    <br>Lord
    <br>My song everyday 
    <br>Father draw me nearer
    <br>Draw me nearer
    <br>Nearer to Thee
    <br>Open your lips; begin to ask for the renewal of this bond.
    <br>There is a bond because He is your Creator.
    <br>There is a bond, there is a covenant.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>There is a bond between you and God because He is your Creator.
    <br>Ask for the renewal of this bond.
    <br>You want Him to assist you in all you do.
    <br>The grace of letting Him, the privilege of letting Him assist you in all you do.
    <br>You ask for this.
    <br>This is the dividend of being born again.
    <br>The dividend of being born again is that grace of assisting you in all you do.
    <br>You ask for this dividend.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON

    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>If the Creator has been assisting you,
    <br>even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil.
    <br>I pray in His Holy Name to give you the mighty grace given to the Apostles of old.
    <br>He gave the grace to Saul and he became Paul.
    <br>I command that special grace in your life today.
    <br>Let the will of God be done in your life.
    <br>Let His will be done in your home.
    <br>Let His will be done in your heart.
    <br>Let the will of God be done in your heart.
    <br>Let the will of God be done in my life.
    <br>Open your lips and say, "Let the will of God be done in my life."
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let His will be done in my life.
    <br>Let His will alone be done, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let His will be done in all I do -
    <br>the will of God in my home, in my career, in my finances,
    <br>in my business, in my marital life, in my health.
    <br>Let the will of God be done, in Jesus' name.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
    <br>Right now, begin to confess who you are.
    <br>Jesus is my Saviour, my Redeemer, my Healer.
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past.
    <br>Confess whom you are.
    <br>Begin to walk in the light of your testimony.
    <br>Confess whom you are.
    <br>EVERYONE Has Been Tempted!!! | TB Joshua SERMON
