    <br>Good Morning Church!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My names are Ochomma Uche.
    <br>I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>There are two parts of my testimony.
    <br>The first part is confessional.
    <br>I belonged to a church, with a group of people who condemned the man of God, who preached against him,
    <br>who called him names not only in our congregation but also to members of other churches.
    <br>I belonged to one of the foremost ministries in Nigeria.
    <br>We had a name for him.
    <br>It is very sad to say it but I say it for the glory of God.
    <br>They used to call him "tuberculosis".
    <br>If you belonged to that church and you are here now - shout "Hallelujah!".
    <br>I know some of them are here.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>I used to be a pastor and later a member of this church, that I told you about.
    <br>We went about vilifying the man of God, speaking evil about him, calling him all sorts of names,
    <br>calling him "antychrist" himself.
    <br>While we were doing this, it occurred to me that this man that I speak against, that I judge -
    <br>I have never heard his word.
    <br>I never...
    <br>I could not recall any of his word that would be offensive.
    <br>So I decided to say, "No. I will look to the scriptures."
    <br>My spirit referred me to Acts 17:11.
    <br>What makes a man noble is his ability to listen to a message and compare it with scriptures,
    <br>besides the miracles.
    <br>Because behind any miracle there must be a Word.
    <br>So, this drove me to watching Emmanuel TV just to hear the man of God.
    <br>When I started listening to the Emmanuel TV, my family was upset with me
    <br>because you couldn't watch Emmanuel TV in my place.
    <br>Even now, some of my acquaintances who are pastors, evangelists -
    <br>as soon as I switch the Emmanuel TV on, they all leave.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>I'm sorry sir, before going further - you mentioned you were a pastor in this ministry and you had been involved
    <br>in saying many negative things concerning the ministry here - The SCOAN.
    <br>Could you just explain a little bit more; for example the kind of prayers that you were offering in that period
    <br>and the kind of things that you were saying at that time?
    <br>Well, you can imagine what you would say against the man, whose words you never heard.
    <br>Because it was a general opinion of our GO, that was the standing order and we believed him.
    <br>So, we took him <T.B. Joshua> as the antichrist himself - certain incarnate,
    <br>who was working miracles with powers that were not of God.
    <br>I am talking of Prophet T.B. Joshua - yes.
    <br>I was moved to listen to this man, to hear his words, to search the scriptures, to find out if what he is saying
    <br>is in accordance with the scriptures.
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, all his teachings, all the words he taught, in their simplicity, they were all
    <br>in accordance with the scriptures.
    <br>Mr Ochoma Uche
    <br>Confession/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>It becomes...
    <br>His teaching are even more clear.
    <br>I began to see the Prophet in a different light.
    <br>I began to feel that perhaps I have been condemning an innocent man.
    <br>I've been speaking evil against an innocent man.
    <br>I felt in my bedroom and I confessed and said, "God, forgive me".
    <br>I remember that day.
    <br>I confessed, I said, "God, forgive me".
    <br>My interest grew to the point that I decided that I would pay a visit to The SCOAN.
    <br>You can imagine; I belong to a church where I preach against the man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua - yes.
    <br>At the same time I was involved in "secret sins".
    <br>I drank, I smoked, I womanised - you can imagine that...
    <br>How a man with this things in his life can condemn a man of God?
    <br>I did it.
    <br>All this happened in my life for the glory of God.
    <br>The truth is: if you are a Christian of any value, none of things I mentioned would ever make you to stand firmly
    <br>in the presence of God.
    <br>Never!
    <br>I know that...
    <br>Yes, I was in the ministry, I was teaching and preaching but right inside of me I knew that all this was "in vain".
    <br>I tried to hide my sins in many ways.
    <br>I would travel 200 kilometres, away from the town, in order to go and indulge myself.
    <br>I would out go at night to very dark places in order to smoke.
    <br>I would drink secretly in places you would never imagine, because I wouldn't want my parents
    <br>my siblings, members of my church to know that I do such deeds.
    <br>I am a brethren.
    <br>I have fought against these things for very long time.
    <br>I have prayed, I have fasted...
    <br>I remember that I fasted for 7 days that the Lord should remove this torment from me.
    <br>2-3 days after the fasting I went back to it.
    <br>I knew that it was a very big problem.
    <br>You said sir that you were hiding these acts.
    <br>Sometimes you would have to travel a long way to indulge yourself.
    <br>Just explain, when you travelled long distances, what would you find yourself doing, even as a pastor.
    <br>Of course, I travelled out in order to hide my sins.
    <br>I travelled out so no eyes would see me doing these sins, that people who know me would not
    <br>recognize me as a person doing such things.
    <br>That was why I had to hide.
    <br>Yes, sleeping with women, prostitutes, drinking...
    <br>I did such things, I did - yes.
    <br>It was very heavy on my spirit, because I know that no person who does such things
    <br>will ever inherit the kingdom.
    <br>It is very clear to me.
    <br>I decided to visit Emmanuel TV after seeing wonders here.
    <br>Initially, I did not pay attention to miracles.
    <br>I was after the Word, because we are redeemed by the Word, through the Word.
    <br>When I listened to the Word, I found the Word correct - then I had the strength to come here.
    <br>Brethren, when I came here for the first time nobody touched me - I just went through the service on Sunday.
    <br>I went home.
    <br>As I left here brethren, without being touched by the man of God, without being prophesied to,
    <br>the spirits of drinking, smoking and womanising left me automatically.
    <br>Mr Ochoma Uche
    <br>Confession/DeliveranceTestimony
    <br>It became a personal sign to me that there is God in this place.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>[God with us.]
    <br>Brethren, these are the things we did against T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am praying that he forgives me.
    <br>I confess publicly.
    <br>I know he is hearing my voice.
    <br>Let him forgive me for what I have done against him.
    <br>I come to what happened here yesterday.
    <br>Yesterday, as the man of God was preaching, I was feeling terribly bad inside of me.
    <br>It was like sitting on thousand of pins.
    <br>My spine, my waist, my belly were hot.
    <br>I was feeling hot inside - extreme discomfort.
    <br>I was in so much pain that I thought that dying would be better for me then to live with such pains in my body.
    <br>When this was going through my body, I remembered his words,
    <br>"All this things have come to take away your joy. Refuse it!"
    <br>I said, "No, it will not take away my joy. If you are dead you will not take away my life".
    <br>I resisted.
    <br>This thing came higher and higher to the point where my eyes went black.
    <br>I thought I was going to fall down.
    <br>What I know, what I had in my ear...
    <br>"This is the storm before the calm".
    <br>From that point the pain started to recede.
    <br>I heard the man of God saying, "In your pains - walk!"
    <br>That was what I remembered him saying.
    <br>I stood up and started moving my limbs.
    <br>To the glory of God - the pain started to recede.
    <br>Now, I am very fit, strong, sound.
    <br>There are no pains any more in my body.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Brother is just sharing the instant testimony of what happened yesterday during the mass prayer
    <br>concerning the very severe pains he was having.
    <br>We want to hear from you again brother; since you first stepped your feet in The SCOAN, you mean to say
    <br>that you stopped all the acts of smoking, drinking, womanising, all of that came to an end in the moment
    <br>you stepped your feet in here?
    <br>That's correct.
    <br>They stopped, the urge, you know...
    <br>Whatever you do starts from the urge.
    <br>It is like a thirst.
    <br>Once that emptiness is created in you, you go after it.
    <br>Once that emptiness, urge is not there, you cannot commit an act.
    <br>The urge, spirit of drinking, womanising, smoking - all of them left me.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>We thank God that our brother is here in our midst to share this testimony.
    <br>We believe there are many valuable lessons that we have learnt from the statements he has made here.
    <br>What is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world; especially those who has engaged in such
    <br>things in the past, including the acts of blasphemy against the servant of God,
    <br>such as Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>What would you advise to them based on your own life experience?
    <br>My advice to you is: do not allow the opinion of people around you
    <br>to steer you away from knowing the truth for yourself.
    <br>Do not allow the public opinion to steer you into coming to the partnership with the public.
    <br>Before you judge a man, hear him.
    <br>Before you find yourself offending somebody, take some time and find out the truth about the person.
    <br>What is the point for you to kill a man and later to find out that the man was innocent?
    <br>How would you feel?
    <br>How would you feel stabbing a man with a sword assuming that he had wounded or killed your brother,
    <br>only to find out that the man was innocent?
    <br>How would you feel?
    <br>That was how I felt.
    <br>I wouldn't want anyone to feel like that.
    <br>So brethren, my advice is to find our the truth for yourself
    <br>and God will bear witness to the man of God.
    <br>Praise God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We can see that as our brother said, the man he that initially condemned, spoke against, used all kinds of
    <br>negative words against, ended up being the very same person whom God used to deliver him
    <br>from that spirit of womanising, alcohol, and smoking.
    <br>We give glory to God that he is here right now.
    <br>Just a final word of advice brother - you said that as a pastor you were engaged is such acts.
    <br>What do you want to advise people who are still struggling with such addictions,
    <br>as someone that passed through that and came out through the deliverance
    <br>you received by stepping your feet in here?
    <br>What is your advice to such people?
    <br>My advice is this: I have tried all my personal strength and I failed.
    <br>I have gone through many deliverances; to no avail.
    <br>The problem with any sin or addiction is spiritual.
    <br>What we need is an intervention of God into this matter.
    <br>And the place that I have found, where one can be truly delivered is The SCOAN.
    <br>If you cannot find a deliverance elsewhere, let this place be your last bus stop.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Remember, we heard what our brother said.
    <br>He said he had just stepped his feet in here.
    <br>He wasn't actually prayed for, he didn't receive a prophecy, he didn't even receive ministration with
    <br>the morning water.
    <br>Just by stepping his feet into the Arena of Liberty that urge left him.
    <br>We know that as you are here today in the Arena of Liberty, as you have stepped your feet in here today
    <br>for those of us present here - your lives will never remain the same, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Brother, we thank God for your life.
    <br>We pray that God will you the grace to continue, to make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and we know that the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
