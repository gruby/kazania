  <p>    
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>As Wise Man Daniel moves along The SCOAN prayer line, ministering prayer in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>see how the people move uncontrollably as the Holy Ghost fire
    <br>begins to consume every area of darkness in their lives
    <br>for where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>See the reaction of this woman as the contrary spirit inside of her is exposed.
    <br>Fire in the mighty name of Jesus! Who are you? Speak!
    <br>Stop it!
    <br>Stop what?
    <br>Stop embarrassing me.
    <br>I am a journalist. I am the one who embarrasses people.
    <br>Okay!
    <br>You won't embarrass me!
    <br>- You are a journalist?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>And you are the one that embarrasses people?
    <br>I am the one who embarrasses people.
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>I make fun of people who come here; I write about them.
    <br>What are the things you say?
    <br>I make fun of the things they do and say.
    <br>I am a journalist.
    <br>Nobody makes fun of me, I make fun of people.
    <br>Stop this!
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>She is my wife now.
    <br>I married her long time ago.
    <br>I entered her through sexual abuse.
    <br>She was two and a mad neighbour slept with her
    <br>without the knowledge of her parents for years.
    <br>What have you done to her marital life?
    <br>She is married to some Nigerian guy who is a soccer player.
    <br>I frustrated his career.
    <br>He can't get a club in South Africa.
    <br>That thing.
    <br>I frustrated him.
    <br>He can't get a club.
    <br>He is not playing.
    <br>And everyone is making fun of him.
    <br>I am fine, Wise Man.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>This one?
    <br>He is my driver.
    <br>He is what?
    <br>He is my driver.
    <br>He used to be my gardener.
    <br>I promoted him to be my driver.
    <br>He used to be your gardener?
    <br>My gardener, yes.
    <br>I promoted him.
    <br>- To what?
    <br>- To a driver.
    <br>You are my driver.
    <br>You are my wife.
    <br>You know you are my driver; you take me everywhere I want to go.
    <br>You are my wife.
    <br>This guy takes me everywhere I want to go.
    <br>I go to functions, he takes me there.
    <br>If I want to go to work, he takes me there.
    <br>I don't want to drive; I refused to drive.
    <br>I have my own car but I use his car.
    <br>I will never drive.
    <br>Who drives you?
    <br>My driver.
    <br>He said, he is your husband.
    <br>This?
    <br>I am an educated woman, how can I marry a soccer player?
    <br>You mean he is not your husband?
    <br>A driver?
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>What is this drama? Cameras?
    <br>I am the one who writes gossip about people.
    <br>What is this thing now?
    <br>What does she do for a living?
    <br>She was a journalist but she stopped.
    <br>She is now a communications manager in a company.
    <br>And you said as a journalist, you make her to embarrass people that come here.
    <br>What are the things that you made her to do?
    <br>She was a gossip writer and wrote for 'page three'.
    <br>- A gossip writer?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- What do you mean by that?
    <br>- She was the best in South Africa.
    <br>How does she do it?
    <br>She writes about celebrities.
    <br>If she sees a celebrity with a woman, she exposes that.
    <br>Marriages have been broken because of the stories she writes.
    <br>Listen, you make her to break marriages because of the stories you make her to write?
    <br>She has written horrible stories about people.
    <br>She would see a man with another woman and write a story.
    <br>She wouldn't drink alcohol, she would be the only sober person at a function -
    <br>she would be looking at what people are doing.
    <br>The following day, the story would be all over the papers.
    <br>What do you have to say about it?
    <br>Actually, what she is saying, she is a journalist.
    <br>She is a well-known journalist in South Africa.
    <br>She would write articles for 'page 3'.
    <br>'Page three' is where people write controversial stories about celebrities
    <br>or government officials.
    <br>She would go and bring it out on the pages so people would always know about that.
    <br>What are the things you say you write about people coming to The Synagogue?
    <br>There was a time, I saw a celebrity on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He confessed that he was having an affair with three women.
    <br>I wrote about that story and he was very embarrassed.
    <br>People who watch Emmanuel TV critised me.
    <br>What is the essence of writing stories about the people that come here?
    <br>What do you want to achieve?
    <br>I wanted to make fun, it was a good story.
    <br>I want to be the best.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>This one?
    <br>I frustrate him.
    <br>What do you mean? What are the things you have done to him?
    <br>I make his wife not to respect him.
    <br>I scatter his money.
    <br>The little money he gets from being a soccer coach
    <br>at one of those schools there, I scatter it just to embarrass him.
    <br>What else have you done?
    <br>He got a nice, cushy job with the police in South Africa.
    <br>Guess what?
    <br>He only earned three salaries.
    <br>What did I do?
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>They just told him that the contract had been terminated
    <br>and that there was a new commissioner who didn't want them anymore.
    <br>What have you done to his career as a footballer ?
    <br>Whose career? This one?
    <br>He can't get a job, he can't get a club.
    <br>Why?
    <br>There was time, he wanted to play with a club.
    <br>Do you know what I did? I frustrated him.
    <br>He didn't get his clearance.
    <br>What can you say about her?
    <br>What she said about driving - I paid for her to take a driving test
    <br>because before we came here, all my documents were stolen from my car.
    <br>I said to her that I wanted to come to The SCOAN and I that I wanted her to come too.
    <br>All of my documents were stolen.
    <br>What happened to his documents?
    <br>I stole them.
    <br>- You stole them?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Where did you take them to?
    <br>To some criminals.
    <br>Who made those people to come and steal those documents?
    <br>I am the one.
    <br>What have you done to the marriage of this woman?
    <br>This guy can't enjoy his wife.
    <br>The wife hates kissing.
    <br>The wife hates sleeping with him.
    <br>The wife disrespects him.
    <br>The wife rules.
    <br>The wife earns more than him, she is the boss.
    <br>What can you say about that?
    <br>Yes, she is authoritative.
    <br>When I send her to do something, she will always argue before doing it.
    <br>She will always make sure she causes some kind of commotion.
    <br>And when she looks at you, she says she is just doing it because of...
    <br>What about the affection?
    <br>The affection - sometimes it is sour.
    <br>She sometimes told me, she saw a spiritual husband in her dreams.
    <br>After that dream, maybe for weeks, 
    <br>we will not want to make love.
    <br>Right now, it is time for you to leave this body.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus! All over your body!
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Go!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You are free. Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm fine, thank you, sir! How are you?
    <br>You said you are the spiritual husband.
    <br>No, he is my husband, sir.
    <br>- He is your husband?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Not your driver?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Or your gardener?
    <br>- No.
    <br>You said, he is your gardener and your driver.
    <br>No.
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>He is the father of my children.
    <br>The initial confession you heard was from the demon that was speaking through her.
    <br>Right now, that demon is out.
    <br>This is your true wife, okay?
    <br>Don't for any reason remind her of what happened today
    <br>so that you also will not be tempted to do the same.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My wife and I are free!
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>There is something the wise men normally say, of which I will remind you:
    <br>Don't remind her, no matter what happens in the house -
    <br>whether the person is your wife, husband, friend or even herself.
    <br>That I have written about somebody -
    <br>those things constitute to attack.
    <br>When someone is delivered...
    <br>Viewers at home, when you watch Emmanuel TV
    <br>and you see your friend being delivered
    <br>and you are now using that in one way or the other -
    <br>it's a great offence.
    <br>No matter what happened,
    <br>you can fight, you can abuse him or her differently -
    <br>not that thing he or she was delivered of.
    <br>If you dare mention that again...
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Unless you are delivered.
    <br>Because I don't know how you can get out of it, unless you are delivered.
    <br>God is saying someone is free, and you are now saying the person is not free.
    <br>Can you see - you are standing against God.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>It is God that has freed her.
    <br>When God says you are free, someone now stands to say, "No!"
    <br>A man confesses that he has an evil spirit
    <br>and I say, "You are free, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>and the person is free immediately.
    <br>Now someone somewhere sees the man one day -
    <br>maybe in one way or the other they were fighting -
    <br>and he says, "Ah, evil spirit",
    <br>you are telling God that the person is not delivered.
    <br>God says the person is delivered and you are now saying the person is not delivered.
    <br>And when you fight against God - oh my God, you are finished!
    <br>So when the wise men say,
    <br>"Don't ever repeat all what you hear now, no matter what happens in future,
    <br>whether you people are fighting or disagreement,
    <br>whether you know the person from somewhere and you hear the confession the person makes
    <br>and you are now using that confession against the person.
    <br>God set the person free of that guilt
    <br>and you are now saying, "No! He is not free".
    <br>Wow! It is the greatest offence.
    <br>Whether you are an apostle, bishop or prophet, or whatever name you call yourself -
    <br>I know that no anointed man would not stand to say such a thing
    <br>because they know the position of God.
    <br>So this is a warning to the whole world.
    <br>Those who will continue to do it -
    <br>you will continue to see many of them and I wish you good luck.
    <br>When you see somebody like this sister now, rejoice with her
    <br>because you too, you need deliverance.
    <br>Let's listen.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Nonyese John.
    <br>The man standing next to me is Namdi John.
    <br>I am a South African and he is a Nigerian.
    <br>We live in Johannesburg.
    <br>I am a journalist by profession and he is a soccer player by profession.
    <br>The problem that brought us here was sickness.
    <br>I had a mild stroke and a spiritual husband.
    <br>When we came here, I wanted to be on the prayer line.
    <br>As a jounalist, you people are very outspoken.
    <br>I want you to be free and talk.
    <br>Before they touched you, what was going through your mind?
    <br>Did you actually believe that what happened to you would happen to you?
    <br>Say everything, feel free.
    <br>Educate the whole world, as a journalist.
    <br>I had been prayed for before.
    <br>I had been with powerful men of God before, breathing the same air with them.
    <br>I had been to Bible school just for fun.
    <br>I had been with men of God before, they laid hands on me
    <br>but nothing happened to me like what happened on that day.
    <br>In some instances, when the man of God was praying for me,
    <br>when people were falling, I would just fall because I felt sorry for him.
    <br>I didn't want him to be embarrassed.
    <br>Journalist - because they are the police of the world,
    <br>they will tell you what they feel.
    <br>She is telling us now that she has been to many places,
    <br>where she saw many people falling, she also fell
    <br>because she felt sorry for the man of God.
    <br>Because I didn't want the man of God to be embarrassed, I would just fall.
    <br>Then, when Wise Man Daniel came, I was very angry.
    <br>Something else had upset me, so I was just chilling.
    <br>I was looking at the Wise Man, thinking he needed a makeover.
    <br>I looked at his hair and stuff like that,
    <br>I even told my husband that the Wise Man needed a makeover
    <br>but he told me to concentrate on what we were here for
    <br>and stop talking about people.
    <br>Then, when the Wise Man touched me,
    <br>it was like I had been hit by something.
    <br>I had never had that experience before in my life.
    <br>I went mad; the spirit in me just went crazy.
    <br>I just wanted to run away.
    <br>I was so angry and uncomfortable.
    <br>I told him that I wanted to go back to South Africa.
    <br>As a celebrity journalist writing 'page three' and gossip,
    <br>I wrote about celebrities, politicians, men of God,
    <br>everyone who was in the lime light.
    <br>If they did something wrong, I would write about it.
    <br>If they cheated on their wives, I would write about it.
    <br>If they didn't pay maintenance, I would write about that.
    <br>If they got drunk, I would write about that.
    <br>If they cheated, I would write about that.
    <br>I was one of the best 'page three' writers in South Africa.
    <br>People hated me, celebrities hated me,
    <br>I had been beaten up, followed around and threatened.
    <br>In September, I saw a South African celebrity on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there was a man in the congregation
    <br>who had three girlfriends, was married and that the man was there.
    <br>I was very shocked to see someone that I knew, that I had written about before,
    <br>who was a well known business man and respected celebrity in South Africa.
    <br>I wrote that story and I was told by the editor to call the man of God
    <br>because if you write and mention anyone in the newspaper, in your story,
    <br>you had to get their comment.
    <br>I knew that it was going to be silly to ask for a comment like that from the man of God.
    <br>I went back to my editor and lied; I said that I couldn not get the man of God
    <br>but we carried on with the story anyway.
    <br>It was published on ''page three' of the newspaper I used to work for.
    <br>Don't worry about the story. We thank God.
    <br>How are you feeling after your deliverance?
    <br>After my deliverance, I went back to the internet.
    <br>I read the story that I had written and was so ashamed of myself.
    <br>I couldn't believe that I had written some of the things that I wrote.
    <br>Can you tell us, when the Wise Man laid his hand on you,
    <br>what actually happened to you?
    <br>The spirit inside of me was very angry.
    <br>I couldn't believe what was happening.
    <br>There were cameras all over the place and a lady was taking pictures of me.
    <br>I just went mad.
    <br>Ok, now as a journalist, what message do you have for your colleagues all over the world?
    <br>Because it is always difficult for you people to believe and now you have seen.
    <br>What message do you have for them?
    <br>The message I have, especially for my colleagues - journalists,
    <br>I had written some of the stories that had been written about The SCOAN.
    <br>People must come here and experience for themselves.
    <br>They mustn't write hearsay.
    <br>This is a place of God; God resides here.
    <br>As I said before, I had breathed the same air with very powerful men of God,
    <br>I had gone to Bible school and I had been with respected men of God
    <br>but I had never in my life experienced what I experienced on that day.
    <br>Now, after your deliverance and after you went to your lodge to sleep,
    <br>tell us your experience now, how you know you are free,
    <br>compare the experience you are having now and the experience you had in the past.
    <br>Since I was two, I have had problems with a spiritual husband.
    <br>It would come in different forms; I would be pressed at night.
    <br>I would be forced to sleep on my stomach
    <br>because I was scared that that thing would press me until I died.
    <br>For the first time in my life I slept peacefully with no problems.
    <br>Sometimes I had been prayed for and would hope
    <br>that the spiritual husband wouldn't come back again but it would come.
    <br>But it has been how many days now and I have not experienced any problems.
    <br>I slept like a baby.
    <br>Hallelujah! Did you listen to that?
    <br>Your love towards your husband - what about the affection?
    <br>Before then, I treated my husband like a friend,
    <br>like he was just one of those people or a brother
    <br>but now we are more like husband and wife.
    <br>I love him more and everything is fine now.
    <br>OK, let's hear from my brother.
    <br>So how are you, my brother?
    <br>I am fine, daddy.
    <br>Now that your wife has been delivered -
    <br>can you just give us in two minutes, before and after - the affection.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Previously, I was staying with a man and a friend.
    <br>What I used to experience at home was like two partners were trying to compete
    <br>or prove a point in the house but I believe that after this deliverance,
    <br>I have experienced a lot of differences.
    <br>I am so blessed and I am very happy with this ministry.
    <br>Have you now recovered your wife from the hands of the evil spirit?
    <br>Completely?
    <br>Totally!
    <br>Thank you. This is what we want to hear.
    <br>I hope you quite understand my question
    <br>because the person he married at the beginning -
    <br>there were many things he saw in the lady when he got married to her.
    <br>Now he has discovered those things, those things were lost for some time.
    <br>He has discovered those things.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Hallelujah.
