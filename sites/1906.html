    <br>Just as the wind and waves obeyed You
    <br>Calm every storm in my life
    <br>Just as the voice of setback was silenced
    <br>Calm every storm in my life
    <br>Just as the blazing fire turns to water
    <br>Calm every storm in my life
    <br>Just as the wind and waves obeyed You Jesus
    <br>Calm every storm in my life
    <br>Just as the voice of setback was silenced
    <br>Calm every storm in my life
    <br>Just as the blazing fire turns to water
    <br>Calm every storm in my life
    <br>Be still in the name of Jesus
    <br>Every storm that rises against me
    <br>Every wind that takes my joy away
    <br>Be still in the name of the Lord
    <br>Be still in the name of Jesus
    <br>Every storm that rises against me
    <br>Every wind that takes my joy away
    <br>Be still in the name of the Lord
    <br>Be still in the name of Jesus
    <br>Every storm that rises against me
    <br>Every wind that takes my joy away
    <br>Be still in the name of the Lord
    <br>Be still in the name of Jesus
    <br>Every storm that rises against me
    <br>Every wind that takes my joy away
    <br>Be still in the name of the Lord
