  <p>    
    <br>A gentleman over there – you have two wives.
    <br>You don’t know how you came about these two wives; they live separately.
    <br>You will not be able to continue this life – it is too tough, too difficult for you.
    <br>You scraped your hair.
    <br>He is a young man with a t-shirt with some pictures on it.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You will not be able to cope; you just need God’s intervention to save you.
    <br>You will not be able to cope this time because people may see you as very hilarious;
    <br>he is a gentleman; it is just appearance.
    <br>My name is Gabriel.
    <br>I come from the Republic of Benin.
    <br>Don't mind my English because I'm not from Nigeria.
    <br>This is my lovely wife.
    <br>This is my first daughter.
    <br>This is my lovely second daughter.
    <br>I came here last week for the first time and the man of God prophesied that someone had two wives
    <br>and they were not in the same country; they were in different countries.
    <br>When the man of God said this, my conscience told me that I wasn’t here for this so don’t rise up.
    <br>Then, I kept sitting.
    <br>But when he repeated it the second time, I don’t know what pushed me to the front.
    <br>Then I said, “Yes, Man of God, the prophecy is mine”.
    <br>I am a marine man; I used to work in Lagos.
    <br>I supply vessels.
    <br>For over three years, my business is not moving.
    <br>I used to travel to Ghana and Lome, Togo for my work.
    <br>Anywhere I went, women used to love me.
    <br>Even if I met them for the first time, they used to fall in love with me.
    <br>My business was not moving at all.
    <br>I went to many places for solution but there was no way.
    <br>One of my friends introduced me to The SCOAN last week, I came and the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>With the work I used to do in Nigeria, I used to stay four to five months before going back to Benin.
    <br>So, my family and my wife used to miss me because when I came to Lagos,
    <br>I used to have many women so, I wouldn’t bother about my family.
    <br>She would be calling me and I would tell her not to worry, that I had come to make money and
    <br>when I had money, I would come home.
    <br>I could stay for five months but no money.
    <br>I would go back home and she would feed me.
    <br>I tried my best; I went to Ghana.
    <br>If the white men came, they would call me at Ghana or Lome.
    <br>If I went there, I would do the work, the money would come but I wouldn't know how the money went.
    <br>I didn’t usually come home with anything.
    <br>When I came for my first time, last week, the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>I said, "Yes, truly; but this was too much".
    <br>I thought to myself that I should get another wife.
    <br>I went out in Lagos, found another lady and got married to her, which my wife doesn’t know about.
    <br>What the man of God said is true.
    <br>I didn’t expect that in my life this secret could leak out because my wife is in Benin,
    <br>while the other woman is staying in Lagos.
    <br>I brought my wife here once but when I got the second wife, I didn’t bring her anymore.
    <br>You mean that today is the first time your wife is hearing of this?
    <br>It is the first time that my wife is hearing this.
    <br>Even the lady that I am talking about now, the man of God said I should invite her and she is here now.
    <br>My wife does not know her.
    <br>Please, I want the man of God to help me settle my family.
    <br>This has destroyed my business.
    <br>When I came here, what the man of God said means that through this, my business is not moving.
    <br>My wife and children are not happy with me.
    <br>That is why my business has a breakage.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me and reconcile my family for me.
    <br>My name is Florence.
    <br>I am from Benin.
    <br>It is because of the prophecy that I got to know that my husband is having a woman outside.
    <br>When he used to tell me that he is going to work, I never thought that he was doing a different thing.
    <br>When he leaves the house, he can stay outside for three months
    <br>and when he comes back, he is never really happy.
    <br>Just for a little thing, he can get annoyed and begin to shout at me.
    <br>So, I am asking the man of God to save my marriage because presently, I am living in
    <br>my parents' house because of the financial problem we have.
    <br>I stay at the house of my parents.
    <br>So, I am asking the man of God to save me and to save my marriage.
    <br>After accommodating Mr Gabriel & his family in The SCOAN, the following Sunday,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua counsels the family and also Mr Gabriel’s second wife,
    <br>telling them the mind of God about their future and praying for them in Jesus' name.
    <br>I also got married to this lady in Lagos.
    <br>You got married?
    <br>How many months now?
    <br>In August, it will be two years.
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>And my sister hearing it...
    <br>For her to even follow you here, she just wants to channel her own course and her own direction;
    <br>she is not interested and sees it as a past tense event.
    <br>Mistakes are correctable.
    <br>When we learn from our mistakes, we move on.
    <br>I want to say to my sister, I am your brother; I am at your service.
    <br>We shall meet after the prayer.
    <br>We can ask God the direction.
    <br>OK?
    <br>This is a family already that God has brought together.
    <br>It is just satan who came to try and separate this family; we thank God it is over today.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Since you have not talked of having a child between you and her, nothing like that?
    <br>No.
    <br>OK
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>It is not an issue you should raise at home; rather, put it behind you.
    <br>If you raise this issue anytime there is trouble, you begin to make jest of your husband
    <br>or remind him of his past, you also may be tempted because the Bible says
    <br>when one is caught out of sin or wrong, you who caught such a person should restore them gently
    <br>so that you will not be tempted.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Counsels Mr Gabriel & His Wife After The Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you, Man of God, I understand.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>After the counselling, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mr Gabriel and his family in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Gabriel.
    <br>I am from the Republic of Benin.
    <br>I am 38 years old.
    <br>The lady beside me is my lovely wife.
    <br>Her name is Florence.
    <br>You are both welcome, sir.
    <br>Can you just tell us what God Almighty has done for you since coming to The SCOAN?
    <br>Two weeks ago, I came to the service and the man of God prophesied that
    <br>there was somebody who had two wives who were not staying in the same country,
    <br>which was my prophesy.
    <br>Then, I rose up very surprised because he said the story of my life and I said, I was the one.
    <br>The man of God invited me to come with those two women to settle our lives.
    <br>Then, I brought them here.
    <br>That was when the man of God told me that because I had been cheating on my wife,
    <br>that things had turned upside down for me because I was not straight forward with her.
    <br>When I was working, all my things were upside down, my business collapsed, nothing went on.
    <br>I believe that any time from today when I apologise to God and her
    <br>that things will get better in the name of Jesus.
    <br>What he advised me to do was to stop looking outside and face my wife and family.
    <br>Then, my life will change.
    <br>I believe that and I apologise to my wife, that the past should be the past,
    <br>let us take steps towards what we are about to start genuinely.
    <br>So, I thank God.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua counselled you that after the prophecy you should stay faithful to your wife
    <br>and that you should disconnect from the relationship with the other lady outside.
    <br>You are saying that right now you are actually asking for forgiveness from your wife
    <br>and you are promising that you are not gonna betray her again, that you gonna be faithful and stay with her.
    <br>Yes, truly – backwards never.
    <br>I am straight forward now with my wife and I promise her that all this is in the past.
    <br>The past cannot come to the present again.
    <br>I promise her one hundred percent of my new life.
    <br>My heart used to be heavy but now, I am light.
    <br>There are a lot of changes in my life and I thank God for all this.
    <br>We thank God for our brother's life and for the reconciliation that has taken place in his marriage
    <br>through that prophetic word and the counsel from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>There are a lot of changes in my life and I thank God for all this.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My name is Florence.
    <br>I am from Benin.
    <br>Who is the man beside you?
    <br>It is my husband.
    <br>When I came to the church, I heard the prophecy given to my husband and I thank God for it.
    <br>I forgive him for all he has done and I ask God to give us a long life together.
    <br>I want to advise other women to take heart; no matter what happens in your home, have faith.
    <br>There is a God who is above all and takes care of all; just be patient and courageous.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>We thank God for this wonderful word of advice and we salute our sister here
    <br>for really choosing to stay in the marriage despite everything that happened.
    <br>Hallelujah. We thank God once again.
    <br>We are here right now with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said that now, as you have started this new chapter in your marriage, a new life in Christ
    <br>after this reconciliation, that he wants to support this family.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>we are presenting you with this gift of 100, 000 naira.
    <br>This is to encourage this family to stay close to Jesus Christ and make the word of God
    <br>the standard for their lives and use this to start a fresh chapter in their lives,
    <br>now that the reconciliation has come, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners for all they have done.
    <br>May God be with them and bless them more.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
