    <br>Viewers all over the world, right now, begin to rejoice about the healing, deliverance,
    <br>breakthrough and freedom that is about to happen.
    <br>In His faith, rejoice, right now.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, the Bible says:
    <br>Come all you that labour, all you that are sick, all you that are poor.
    <br>Lord, I have come.
    <br>Say after me, viewers, "Lord, I have come.
    <br>In Your faith, I have come".
    <br>Begin to confess this, right now.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>begin to separate yourself, in the name of Jesus, from that disease,
    <br>that disease in your liver - separate yourself!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Heal them, Lord; they have come!
    <br>Loose them, Lord!
    <br>Heal them from this affliction.
    <br>Deliver them from this affliction.
    <br>Open your lips; begin to separate yourself.
    <br>Break it!
    <br>Break the affliction.
    <br>Break it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prayer.
