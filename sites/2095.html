    <br>PROPHET TB JOSHUA
    <br>AT THE PRAYER MOUNTAIN
    <br>WE WELCOME PROPHET TB JOSHUA
    <br>FROM THE PRAYER MOUNTAIN
    <br>WHERE THE YEAR OF HUMILITY, THE YEAR OF FEAR AND THE AMERICAN ELECTION WERE PROPHESIED!
    <br>LET US LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAS TO SAY FOR THE COMING YEAR ...
    <br>Merry Christmas And Happy New Year!
    <br>Every rightful man simply has great habits.
    <br>Habit is a gift from God.
    <br>Right from the beginning of my ministry, I have been staying close to nature.
    <br>Nature enhances spirituality.
    <br>Daniel prayed three times a day on his knees
    <br>(Daniel 6:10).
    <br>The psalmist prayed seven times daily
    <br>(Psalm 119:164).
    <br>The disciples of Jesus Christ prayed on the first day of each week (Acts 20:7).
    <br>These were their habits.
    <br>This is what the Lord Jesus has led me to do
    <br>for the challenges that are awaiting us in the coming year.
    <br>This year is planting a seed that will be harvested next year.
    <br>What this monster has been destroying will be seen clearly next year.
    <br>Are we talking of companies - I mean industries that are being destroyed,
    <br>people losing their jobs,
    <br>educational and faith organisations - I mean faith institutions being destroyed,
    <br>divorce here and there,
    <br>poverty becoming the order of the day?
    <br>This is why the Lord has given me the grace to make these faith tools.
    <br>This is the new sticker for our protection and for all our belongings.
    <br>This is a new Anointing Water.
    <br>The content is new every morning.
    <br>Never a sickness it cannot heal!
    <br>Never an affliction it cannot cure, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Never a problem it cannot solve!
    <br>Never a burden it cannot bear, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Why the choice of water instead of oil?
    <br>It is because it can be applied on any part of the body.
    <br>It is not for sale; that is why it is anointed.
    <br>Don't be deceived due to desperation.
    <br>Don't forget - ignorance is a sin.
    <br>T.B. Joshua At The Prayer Mountain
    <br>It is not for sale. This is the package - the content is new every morning.
    <br>Don't be deceived due to desperation.
    <br>It is full of resurrection fire.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Ministers
    <br>The New Anointing Water
    <br>I feel the fire - resurrection power - I feel it!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Ministers
    <br>The New Anointing Water
    <br>Your business that has been sleeping - it is a new dawn!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Ministers
    <br>The New Anointing Water
    <br>Your finances that have been sleeping - it is a new dawn!
    <br>Your marriage that has been sleeping - it is a new dawn!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Ministers
    <br>The New Anointing Water
    <br>Your health that has been sleeping - it is a new dawn!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
    <br>I have with me the prophetic message for the coming year.
    <br>I need to study it clearly; that is why I will not be able to declare it here.
    <br>I want to study it because the message here is full of idiom.
    <br>I need to study it and ask God again and again.
    <br>I'm just a servant. I need to ask God again and again
    <br>and understand it before declaring it to the world.
    <br>This is cure here.
