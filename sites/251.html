    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My names are Prophet Chris Chibunna Azuoau. I'm from Rivers State.
    <br>People of God, I am excited to stand in your midst to share my testimony.
    <br>It was the second week of September, after my music came out.
    <br>I was sleeping in my bed one night when four hefty men came into my room.
    <br>It was a dream, but it seemed as if it were real.
    <br>They said they had come to kill me. I asked them what I had done.
    <br>They said that they had not come to give me an explanation, that they had come to kill me.
    <br>I told them that they could not kill me.
    <br>In the midst of an argument, we started fighting.
    <br>We fought and as I tried to pick up my cutlass,
    <br>one of the men pulled out a shotgun and shot at my heart.
    <br>I said to myself, "No, it's not true".
    <br>The bullet lifted me from my dream and hit me onto the floor.
    <br>When I fell to the floor, I realised that it was a dream.
    <br>I started shouting. My heart felt as if something was compressing it.
    <br>When I saw myself on the floor, I shouted.
    <br>My wife and kids came and asked me what had happened.
    <br>I told them that they had shot me in the dream.
    <br>There was a burning sensation in my heart.
    <br>I said, "God, what is happening?"
    <br>When the day broke, I fell sick.
    <br>I became weak, dizzy and couldn't stand.
    <br>I couldn't bathe. After some days, I discovered that I couldn't drive.
    <br>One day, I went for a check up. My friend took me to hospital.
    <br>I was driving, but along the way I discovered that I couldn't drive.
    <br>I abandoned my car and used public transportation.
    <br>They used machines to check my heart and lungs, but found nothing wrong,
    <br>yet I was deteriorating.
    <br>The scar on my heart where I was shot started growing.
    <br>The mark was so real. The area was as if there was an oven (very hot).
    <br>This is the place of the mark.
    <br>Immediately when I was shot in the dream, as I woke up on the floor,
    <br>this place became reddish.
    <br>They checked me but found nothing.
    <br>When I came back, the problem continued.
    <br>The launching of my music that I planned to do, I could not do any longer.
    <br>I went to four different hospitals. They checked me but did not find anything.
    <br>I started asking God, "Is that how I am going to die?"
    <br>NIGHTMARE BULLET UNCOVERED
    <br>Demonic Dreams In Reality!!!
    <br>This sickness continued until the end of November.
    <br>One of my brothers came here and was privileged to receive the Anointing Water.
    <br>When I learnt that he came to The SCOAN,
    <br>I sent my personal assistant to go and call him and he came.
    <br>I knelt down and said, "I learnt you went to The SCOAN". He said, "Yes".
    <br>I asked him, "Did you get the Anointing Water?". He said, "Yes".
    <br>I told him that if he gave me one drop I would be okay.
    <br>NIGHTMARE BULLET UNCOVERED
    <br>Demonic Dreams In Reality!!!
    <br>When he brought out the bottle, it looked so small.
    <br>I expected something that could be poured into a cup for me to drink.
    <br>I said, "Is that all?". He said, "Yes".
    <br>He said I should open my mouth and he sprayed it twice.
    <br>I begged him to spray some on my hand, which he did.
    <br>I rubbed that hand on my chest.
    <br>The burning sensation ceased instantly.
    <br>NIGHTMARE BULLET UNCOVERED
    <br>Demonic Dreams In Reality!!!
    <br>I checked myself, wondering if it were a dream.
    <br>I called my wife and told her that I would eat, because it had affected my appetite to eat.
    <br>I ate and happily went back to bed.
    <br>Every night I would tune my station to Emmanuel TV,
    <br>because each time you switch on Emmanuel TV in your house,
    <br>you invite the presence of God.
    <br>Around 4 o'clock, I woke up.
    <br>I heard the man of God praying on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He said, "You are healed from that disease! You are separated from that poison! You are healed!"
    <br>All of a sudden he said, "Vomit that poison!"
    <br>I began to vomit.
    <br>I vomited poisonous substances and blood.
    <br>I shouted.
    <br>When those things came out, I felt like they used a broom to sweep my heart.
    <br>I shouted.
    <br>My wife, neighbours and everybody came out.
    <br>I showed them. Then we prayed and ministered the Anointing Water on it.
    <br>When I swept with the broom to clean up, I heard something move.
    <br>I checked and it was a bullet.
    <br>I want to show you.
    <br>NIGHTMARE BULLET UNCOVERED
    <br>Demonic Dreams In Reality!!!
    <br>You can see on the screen right now, that is the bullet that the brother said he vomited.
    <br>That was after receiving the Anointing Water
    <br>and then praying with Prophet T.B. Joshua through the medium of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He said that he vomited out a lot of substances
    <br>and that inside all of the blood and the mucus that he vomited out,
    <br>there was this very bullet that you can see on your screen.
    <br>And as we recall from the beginning of the testimony,
    <br>he said that he received a gunshot in his dream some months back.
    <br>And from there his life and his health went downhill.
    <br>But we thank God Almighty, through the medium of the Anointing Water and Emmanuel TV,
    <br>the root cause of that problem was exposed and removed.
    <br>After I vomited, I discovered this bullet.
    <br>I was afraid and asked how a bullet shot in the dream could be seen, physically.
    <br>It was a mystery to me and I said, "I must come to The SCOAN
    <br>and share this testimony to tell the world that
    <br>the anointing power of God is inside this Anointing Water.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your testimony.
    <br>Ever since you vomited this bullet and it left your body, how is your health, how is your life now?
    <br>That is why I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>That took place on 30 November.
    <br>On 1 December, being a Saturday morning, as I vomited the bullet, I said that I would not tell anybody.
    <br>I have been checking myself since that time.
    <br>From December 1st until now, my heart has been free. All the pain has gone.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>I have a word for the world.
    <br>If you have not been to The SCOAN, you are missing something.
    <br>I want to advise the viewers and the world in general.
    <br>Everybody should come down to The SCOAN and be delivered.
    <br>For a long time I had been trying to come here, but people kept discouraging me saying, "Don't go!"
    <br>But when this miracle happened to me, I knew that God was in this place.
    <br>I am begging the government; they should make it a law
    <br>that everybody must come to The SCOAN and be delivered.
