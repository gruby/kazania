    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The Spirit of the Father operates in our hearts.
    <br>These foolish spirits choose the nose, tongue, head, eyes, mouth to operate.
    <br>This is why what you don't want to see is what you are looking at.
    <br>What you don't want to hear, you hear.
    <br>Your mental assent is out of order.
    <br>Whatever spirits operating in your eyes, mouth, head -

    <br>Jesus
    <br>Blessed Jesus

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>When you sit down and meditate and think over all that has happened today,
    <br>one thing is clear -
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>When you get back home and think about what you have seen today - the summary of everything -
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>This means, truth is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Now, what will be your meditation, your thoughts?
    <br>Take more of me, Jesus
    <br>and give me more of You
    <br>You need more of Him to live for Him
    <br>because you are not the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>But, He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>You have a beginning and you have an end,
    <br>but He has no beginning and He has no end.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>So, you need more of Him to live for Him.
    <br>You are more of yourself, that is why surprise always comes to you.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by 'surprise'?
    <br>Your life has been arranged according to His will
    <br>- your life, what will happen tomorrow, after tomorrow.
    <br>This is what happened to Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.
    <br>When He first said, "Let this cup pass over,"
    <br>the Spirit of Father said to Him,
    <br>"Remember, Your life has been arranged according to My will".
    <br>He said, "Father, let Your will be done".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Tell your neighbour: My life has been arranged according to the will of God.
    <br>When you have more of God in your life,
    <br>He will reveal to you His will in the next moment.
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>Must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>In my life every day
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>Must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>In my life every day
    <br>Right now, remain quiet and say after me:
    <br>Take more of me, oh Lord.
    <br>Give me more of You -
    <br>more of Your faithfulness,
    <br>more of Your kindness,
    <br>more of your holiness,
    <br>more of your humility,
    <br>more of your obedience.
    <br>Oh Lord, my soul is waiting for You.
    <br>In Your Word is my life.
    <br>In Your Word is my salvation.
    <br>In Your Word is my protection.
    <br>My soul is waiting for You, oh Lord.
    <br>Right now, remain silent for a moment and say this, and get completely connected.
    <br>When you are connected, no one can disconnect you.
