    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>Madam with a white headtie.
    <br>Where is your little one?
    <br>He is at home.
    <br>Do you know the reason why I am asking? Yes, you should know the reason.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You struggled to have that one.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You have lost one.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Your loved one died while a baby.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I am seeing the same spirit pursuing this one.
    <br>Oh.
    <br>Not, "Oh". Please, I am just ...
    <br>Deliver me, Man of God.
    <br>I'm just calling you out to say that you will get over this.
    <br>My name is Mrs Oseyande.
    <br>I am living at Ogun, Nigeria.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave me is 100 percent correct.
    <br>The mother of my son's wife told me to come here, that this was the last bus stop -
    <br>the only place where my son could get his deliverance.
    <br>This is the picture.
    <br>He is in the hospital now.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mrs Osayende.
    <br>The person beside me is Genesis Osayende.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy the man of God gave me to bring healing to the life of my son.
    <br>That fateful day I was sitting down here.
    <br>The man of God walked to me and said, "Madam with the white headtie, where is that child?".
    <br>I said, "He is at home".
    <br>He said, "Do you know what I am talking about?".
    <br>I said, "Yes, sir".
    <br>He said that, "You know you suffered before having that child".
    <br>I said, "Yes, sir".
    <br>He said that, "You know you gave birth to a baby that died".
    <br>I said, "Yes, sir".
    <br>He said that, "I see the same spirit that killed that baby is the one that is pursuing this one too".
    <br>I said, "Oh". He said, "Not 'oh'".
    <br>I said, "Man of God, deliver me".
    <br>He said, "I want you to be free of it".
    <br>And that is the problem that brought me here that day.
    <br>This is my son next to me.
    <br>He is living in South Africa and has been in the hospital for over two months.
    <br>On July 7th, the sister called me and said, "Mommy, Genesis is in the hospital".
    <br>I said, "What happened?".
    <br>She said, "He is complaining about his chest.
    <br>After three days he was paralysed and could not move his hand or his legs
    <br>and saliva started dripping out of his mouth".
    <br>She said, "Mommy, please pray".
    <br>I was praying. My children and I would pray together, but there was no solution.
    <br>My sister called me and Thuli said, "Mommy, you are in Nigeria.
    <br>This boy is not fine in South Africa in the hospital. He has been there for almost two months now.
    <br>Can't you go to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations?".
    <br>I said, "It is true. Let me run to The SCOAN".
    <br>And that is the problem that brought me here that day.
    <br>After that prophecy that day, my sister called me
    <br>and said, "Mommy, I watched you on Emmanuel TV. The man of God located you".
    <br>They now went to the hospital to go and play the video to my son.
    <br>They said, "Genesis, mommy went to The SCOAN and the man of God located her and he mentioned your case".
    <br>Can you tell us, what did the doctor say about his condition?
    <br>What were the things he could not do?
    <br>What was his condition then?
    <br>He was dripping saliva from his mouth, his hand was paralysed, he could not talk and he could not eat.
    <br>He just lay down in one place.
    <br>The doctor said that if care was not taken he was going to die.
    <br>That is what the doctor told me before I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>After the prophecy the man of God gave to me, I was sitting down there.
    <br>The same sister, Thuli, called me and said, "Mommy, we are in the hospital.
    <br>We played the video for Genesis, and Genesis is ok. There is an improvement".
    <br>The doctor came on the Monday and asked, "What happened?".
    <br>My sister told him that his mommy went to The SCOAN,  where the man of God located her.
    <br>He said, "That is why. That is the only place that you can get healing. That is the only place miracles happen".
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>And tell us what happened to your son after that prophecy?
    <br>He was healed. He was restored.
    <br>He called me on the Tuesday.
    <br>The prophecy also brought deliverance to me. I struggled because I was confused.
    <br>On Tuesday after I had left the church, I was at home asleep. I was feeling light and calm in my spirit.
    <br>I didn't know that my son was trying to phone me almost ten minutes earlier.
    <br>When I woke up, I saw the missed call. I said, "Aunty Thuli has been calling me".
    <br>I flagged them and they called me back.
    <br>She said, "Mommy, Genesis wants to talk to you".
    <br>I said, "Give Genesis the phone".
    <br>I said, "Genesis, how are you?".
    <br>He said, "Mommy, I am ok. I am fine. I want to leave here. I am ok".
    <br>I said, "When you leave the hospital, just come to Nigeria to give your testimony".
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the miracle-working God.
    <br>That is when he was in the hospital,
    <br>and this one is when he was paralysed.
    <br>He could not move his hand and his leg.
    <br>My name is Genesis Osayende. I am a Nigerian studying in South Africa.
    <br>This is my mother, Mrs Osayende.
    <br>I am here concerning the prophecy that saved my life.
    <br>It all started in July last year.
    <br>One night I felt a pain in my chest, so I was asked to lie down.
    <br>When I woke up after sleeping for 45 minutes, I couldn't move my hands, I couldn't move my legs and I couldn't talk.
    <br>Saliva was coming out of my mouth.
    <br>They were surprised.
    <br>I needed assistance going to the toilet.
    <br>So they called my parents and they asked them to take me to the hospital.
    <br>When I was in the hospital, the doctor did some tests on me and they could not find anything wrong with me,
    <br>but I was paralysed - I couldn't walk, I couldn't move my hands, I couldn't dress myself, I couldn't eat.
    <br>I couldn't talk - I could hear what they were saying, but I couldn't respond.
    <br>They did tests and gave me some injections and so on.
    <br>Based my paralysis, they gave me treatment hoping that it would work.
    <br>I was in hospital for about six to seven weeks.
    <br>On a Sunday, a sister came to the hospital to check up on me.
    <br>She said, "Genesis, did you know that your mom was at The SCOAN?".
    <br>I said, "My mom?". She said, "Yes. This is the prophecy that the man of God spoke about your case".
    <br>As I saw the video on the phone, I felt a sensation in my body.
    <br>Suddenly, I felt that I could walk and I could move my hands.
    <br>The saliva that was coming out of my mouth stopped, because there was always saliva coming out of my mouth.
    <br>Hallelujah. We can hear the amazing power of God.
    <br>You mean, you were on the hospital bed paralysed
    <br>when the sister came and showed you the prophecy on a phone
    <br>that your mother had received that day in The SCOAN in Nigeria? Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Tell us once again, what was your experience as you were watching that video?
    <br>I felt a sensation in my body and I could move my hands.
    <br>There was always saliva coming out of my mouth.
    <br>Sometimes I would try to stop it - I would move my mouth like this, but the saliva would still come out my mouth.
    <br>I would think, "Why is this saliva coming out?".
    <br>So it just stopped. I said, "Wow!".
    <br>I could now walk properly and do things like eat my food and bath myself,
    <br>because previously, whenever I wanted to take a bath, I was assisted by the patient I shared a room with.
    <br>After some days the doctor came and said, "Genesis, you have improved. I am going to sign your discharge form".
    <br>I said, "Wow! Really?". He signed the discharge form and I was discharged from the hospital.
    <br>My mom told me that I need to come and give my testimony,
    <br>so I booked a flight and I came from South Africa to Nigeria.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for the miracle-working God.
    <br>We can see you standing before us.
    <br>Can you just exercise your body, move around and show us all those things you could not do before?
    <br>I couldn't walk like this when I was in the hospital.
    <br>I couldn't move my hands like this.
    <br>I couldn't even lift my hand, but now I can.
    <br>You can do everything now?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>My advice to the young people all over the world is that they should give their lives to Christ and believe in Christ,
    <br>because only Christ alone can do it.
    <br>My advice to the whole world and to the people in the church here,  is just believe and have faith.
    <br>Your faith will bring you here to testify, just as my faith brought me here to testify, in Jesus' name.
