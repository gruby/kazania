    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>What was the problem you had before?
    <br>A very serious ulcer pain here.
    <br>So, as you were preaching there, I said,
    <br>"If you are a man of God, when you touch me and this pain goes, I will know".
    <br>As you touched me, I can't feel the pain - for over 20 years.
    <br>You can't see what?
    <br>There's no pain again.
    <br>What kind of pain?
    <br>Ulcer pain.
    <br>For how many years?
    <br>It's more than 22 years.
    <br>But after touching you, what happened?
    <br>I'm not feeling it anymore.
    <br>It's gone!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I allowed him to talk out of many I have touched.
    <br>I don't just touch you. What will I derive from touching you and you falling down?
    <br>Sometimes when I touch you and you don't fall, I still want to touch you
    <br>until that thing leaves you.
    <br>I know what is leaving you.
    <br>You may not know.
    <br>At least almost four people I touched here - poverty left them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But the problem many of you have is that when you are touched like that,
    <br>because you do not advertise your problem, before touching you, you keep to yourself.
    <br>I will never forget who is the light when I come out from where?
    <br>Darkness.
    <br>Now you are coming out of darkness but you keep the light.
    <br>From darkness to light.
    <br>From darkness to light - those problems are darkness.
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Honourable Jones Dangba. I'm from Abuja (Nigeria).
    <br>We were asked to come for interview, to state what was wrong with us.
    <br>Since I didn't have a medical report for ulcer, I didn't include it.
    <br>So at midnight I woke up and said,
    <br>"Well, God, this is the arena of liberty.
    <br>If this is a man of God and I believe he is because that is why I came,
    <br>prove that he is a man of God".
    <br>He came behind me and touched me. I said, "This is it!"
    <br>Immediately I stood up, he just took his hand and hit directly.
    <br>You can't touch the spot with your finger.
    <br>He hit the hand directly and I fell down.
    <br>He went round, came back again and hit me again.
    <br>As I touched the stomach, no single pain!
    <br>I had this problem for the last 21 years.
    <br>My father has gone to be with the Lord.
    <br>He had the same ulcer issue.
    <br>My mother has the ulcer issue.
    <br>I had the same ulcer issue, and I said,
    <br>"God, this thing must end with me!"
    <br>Even my little daughter, who is now a youth copper, also has the problem.
    <br>I said, "No, this is generational; it must end with me today!"
    <br>But what surprised me was that I didn't include it
    <br>and I only spoke to God in my heart, "If this is a man of God, let him detect this fault".
    <br>And he hit me there and as I stand here,
    <br>I have never seen this type of healing before, since I was born.
    <br>Totally free! God detected the ulcer! I'm healed!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, you mean to say, sir, that as the prophet was moving around,
    <br>the exact spot where he touched you
    <br>was the exact area you'd had this severe stomach ulcer for over twenty years.
    <br>Yes, exactly 21 years.
    <br>He hit it; he didn't just touch me.
    <br>I want to thank God that this is my own gift for the year!
    <br>I have crossed my bridge. Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Sir, just tell us - before coming to The SCOAN,
    <br>what were the kind of pains you were in because of this ulcer
    <br>and how did it affect your life negatively?
    <br>I couldn't eat pepper as such; I couldn't.
    <br>If I ate a particular food, I had to buy medication and take it.
    <br>They know me in a particular pharmacy behind my house.
    <br>I used to say, "Give me anything anti-ulcer".
    <br>When they saw me, the pharmacist would say, "Anything anti-ulcer!"
    <br>So every week, I finished one packet.
    <br>When I ate, I had to take it.
    <br>Otherwise, I would have to complain. I would not sleep well.
    <br>Right now, sir, can you just touch the area where you were having the problem.
    <br>This is the matter now; I'm not feeling it.
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus, for healing me!
