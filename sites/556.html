  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is busy praying for those in attendance at the Friday healing and deliverance service,
    <br>at The SCOAN.
    <br>From Niger State.
    <br>This is water?
    <br>This is water, man of God.
    <br>Ask him whether he will give me a drink.
    <br>Here we see Prophet T.B. Joshua taking a flask from the man and drinking the water within,
    <br>showing us that God's kind of love is unconditional.
    <br>God says, "Love your neighbour as yourself".
    <br>Love your neighbour irrespective of colour or creed.
    <br>After drinking some of the water the Prophet playfully loops the flask on his own arm,
    <br>making the man feel happy and "at home" in an unfamiliar environment.
    <br>This is the love of God.
    <br>Giving the elderly man a loving embrace Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for him, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>over the problems in his life.
    <br>He falls to the floor under the anointing of God.

    <br>He is free. Give him anything he wants to eat, anything he wants to drink.
    <br>OK, I will give him accommodation to sleep here before he goes back.
    <br>All right sir. Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>I drank his water because I love him.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>To God be the glory. All the way...
    <br>Glory be to God.

    <br>I am a cattle rearer.
    <br>He says he is a cattle rearer, that is the work he does for a living.
    <br>Can he tell us the problem that brought him here today?
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>I had a stomach ulcer but I'm now healed.
    <br>Can he explain to us how did he feel when the man of God touched him at the prayer line?
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>I am OK, I thank God; I feel healthy. I'm strong now, thank you.
    <br>He feels good and all things passed out.
    <br>Can he demonstrate; touch the stomach to confirm that he is completely healed?
    <br>Can he tap the stomach?
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>Thank you, I'm healed.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I'm Pastor Kenneth from Niger State, Nigeria.
    <br>The person standing beside me here is Baba Alhaji Gebrila.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Who are the rest of the people that have come with you here today?
    <br>They are our brothers from Niger State.
    <br>We came together to The SCOAN for prayers and deliverance.
    <br>We can recall seeing Baba Gebrila at the prayer line at the Friday's healing and deliverance service
    <br>at the church, where the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua met our father here.
    <br>We can recall the bottle of water that attracted the Prophet to him, and Prophet drank the water.
    <br>Can you tell us what was it that originally brought our father here to The SCOAN?
    <br>Our father here was having a stomach ulcer for many years.
    <br>He was not able to eat; he was not able to sleep.
    <br>When he was watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>people told him that if he came here, he would be healed.
    <br>He decided to come.
    <br>They then gathered money and chartered this vehicle down to The SCOAN for prayer.
    <br>We heard about The SCOAN through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We watch every Sunday and other days.
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>What brought me here was the problem of stomach ulcer and as I have come, the Lord has healed me.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>He said that it was a stomach ulcer that brought him here.
    <br>As he came, the Lord has helped him. He thanks God.
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>Now I feel OK and very strong, I thank God for that.
    <br>He says that now he feels OK and very strong and he thanks God for that.
    <br>Can you tell us; since the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua, can you eat and sleep now?
    <br>How are you feeling?
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>Now I can eat and sleep. I thank God very much.
    <br>He says that now he can eat and sleep. He thanks God very much.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for the wonderful grace and the miracle our Lord Jesus Christ has performed
    <br>in the life of our father.
    <br>Can you tell us what are the challenges that you are still facing now?
    <br>The challenges we are facing now are that we need about 12,000 naira to take us back to Niger State
    <br>because we have spent a lot of money, to the level that the man of God had to intervene
    <br>to give us money to feed ourselves, and for accommodation.
    <br>Now we are broke and we need about 12,000 naira to settle the driver to go back to Niger State.
    <br>Right now we would like to present you the gift on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is a gift of 20,000 naira for transport back to your state.
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>He says, "Thank you"
    <br>They all say, "Thank you very much".
    <br>Not only that; man of God has also got another gift for you.
    <br>This is a gift of 40,000 naira.
    <br>That's a gift of 5,000 naira per person here.
    <br>This is the gift.
    <br>LOVE Beyond RELIGION | TB Joshua
    <br>He said, "Thank you very much; we are very grateful.
    <br>The giving does not stop there.

    <br>That is 8 bags of rice all together.

    <br>Mohammed Baba
    <br>Niger State, Nigeria.
    <br>I thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>Jesus will repay him for all his goodness.
    <br>When we arrived here, I was wondering how they would pay me my money for transporting them back to
    <br>Niger State because I'm the driver.
    <br>When we arrived, we didn't even have any money buy food.
    <br>We were hungry but now we thank God and we thank Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He gave food to all of us that are here. We thank Jesus Christ.
    <br>We have just listened to the driver of the vehicle that brought these all people from Niger State,
    <br>the northern part of Nigeria.
    <br>They said they came to The SCOAN.
    <br>When they came they were unable to pay their transportation fees.
    <br>The man of God paid for the transportation fee of each and everyone of them.
    <br>He even gave the driver a cash gift and also bags of rice for everyone.
    <br>The driver said he was very grateful and thankful to God Almighty for using the man of God to do such things,
    <br>because he has been thinking of how he was going to get the money and to take them back to the Niger State.
    <br>These were the things he was thinking about.
    <br>He is happy now that the man of God sorted it out, called him and paid the transportation fee for everyone,
    <br>and even gave them extra cash gifts and bags of rice.
    <br>He is happy and thankful for what God Almighty has used man of God to do in the life of these people,
    <br>that have come from Niger State in the northern part of Nigeria.
    <br>I want to appreciate the name of the Lord for Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>We came to this place and he has been so good to us.
    <br>When we came we were broke.
    <br>He gave us accommodation.
    <br>He fed us up to this point and now we are going back.
    <br>He didn't only heal Baba and heal our diseases and sicknesses, he also gave us cash gift.
    <br>We thank God for everything that he has done in our lives.
    <br>May the Lord bless him; may the Lord reward him.
    <br>Grateful to God for the gifts of 5,000 naira each, making a total of 40,000 naira, in addition to 20,000 naira
    <br>they received for their transport back to Niger State, 8 bags of rice and a bottle of Anointed Water each,
    <br>they load up their vehicle with the bags of rice and the few items they came with.
    <br>With everything ready they set about getting into the car.
    <br>With the wave they are off on their long journey back to Niger State;
    <br>healed, happy, and thanking Jesus Christ.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
