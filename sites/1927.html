  <p>    
    <br>Mr Odigie is brought in a car by his family to The SCOAN.
    <br>He suffers from inability to walk,
    <br>lying flat in a car because of excruciating pain caused by a spinal cord injury.
    <br>You can see the expression of agony on the man's face,
    <br>as they carry him out of the car into the wheelchair.
    <br>In deep sorrow and distress, the man's family wheel him to the emergency section of The SCOAN,
    <br>looking in faith unto our Lord Jesus Christ to have mercy and heal their brother.
    <br>Jesus never says no to those who ask for healing, according to His Word
    <br>because His will for us is to be physically healed and spiritually saved.
    <br>God's power and effectiveness have not changed.
    <br>Let's hear from Mr John Odigie.
    <br>Please, help me!
    <br>I am a sinner.
    <br>Please, I am a sinner.
    <br>I am dying.
    <br>I want to walk, Man of God!
    <br>Man of God, please help me!
    <br>Help my back, stomach.
    <br>Help me!
    <br>What is the cause of the problem?
    <br>Can you please tell me the cause?
    <br>He woke up and said he felt pain in his back - when I went to see him.
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>His power and effectiveness are even greater today
    <br>because He can be in all places at all times by His Spirit.
    <br>Healing is taking place.
    <br>As it was, so it is; Jesus Christ healed the sick and still heals today.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua is praying for Mr Odigie,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God.
    <br>Save me, Man of God - from pain in my stomach and my back!
    <br>Save me, Man of God!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk!
    <br>ABSOLUTE AGONY!!! | Watch A Paralysed Man WALK AGAIN!
    <br>To God be the glory, Jesus Christ has done it again.
    <br>As Spirit filled words are spoken to Mr Odigie's life, he rises and walks
    <br>healed, in Jesus' all-powerful name.
    <br>Unassisted and with a smile enlightening his face,
    <br>Mr John Odigie walks boldly through the church, no longer on a wheelchair.
    <br>Onlookers from around the world marvel and record the miracle they witnessed happened
    <br>before their very eyes.
    <br>The man who was earlier brought in a car is now walking freely because of Jesus Christ.
    <br>He could not sit down like this before.
    <br>Man of God, thank you very much!
    <br>God bless you!
    <br>Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>He is my younger brother.
    <br>Your brother needs to eat.
    <br>After eating, he will be able to run more than you.
    <br>Give him food.

    <br>Who is like your Jesus
    <br>In this world
    <br>Who is like your Jesus
    <br>In this world
    <br>Who is like your Jesus
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Filled with ease and joy, Mr John Odigie stands to his feet
    <br>and moves in to position to share his incredible testimony.
    <br>The wheelchair he once depended on has become part of his history.
    <br>My name is John Odigie.
    <br>On Wednesday, I came here with paralysis of the body.
    <br>On that day, I could not walk, move; I had pain all over my body - waist, stomach.
    <br>In fact, I could not move my legs.
    <br>When I was brought here on that day,
    <br>I was brought before the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua at the prayer line.
    <br>He came to me, held my back that was in pain and as he was touching me,
    <br>the pain started going away gradually until he told me to stand up and I started to walk.
    <br>I don't have any pain in my body.
    <br>I can walk properly now, as you can see.
    <br>My name is Mrs Ize Iyamu.
    <br>The man here is my younger brother.
    <br>I will thank God and we thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for saving us from all these problems.
    <br>I was very happy that day and I really cried.
    <br>Tears of joy came out of my eyes.
    <br>I will live my life as a good Christian.
    <br>I promise to serve God and sin no more.
