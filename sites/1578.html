  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise the living Jesus!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we greet you Good Morning, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let someone say, "Good Morning to my health!"
    <br>Say, "Good Morning to my finances!"
    <br>Say, "Good Morning to my career!"
    <br>Say, "Good Morning to my family!"
    <br>Good Morning to my heart!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God.
    <br>Good Morning to you all, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>My name is Yinka.
    <br>We are in the presence of God to attract His attention to perform for us.
    <br>Am I right?
    <br>We are in His presence for Him to break every chain of sickness, stagnation, failure.
    <br>But I want to begin by asking you this question:
    <br>Is your heart free to receive Him?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>Is your heart free to receive Him?
    <br>The devil oftentimes attacks our heart -
    <br>the seat of our emotions, confidence and trust.
    <br>He fights with lies and sometimes, his lies sound like the truth.
    <br>But the Bible says only believers have God's truth which can defeat the lies of the devil.
    <br>Many people today get distracted fighting mere flesh and blood.
    <br>If we fail to realise that there are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage,
    <br>then we are fighting the wrong battle.
    <br>Today many are victims of self-bondage, self-imprisonment, self-captivity.
    <br>What are the causes of self-bondage?
    <br>What are the causes of self-imprisonment?
    <br>Let someone say, "Offence."
    <br>When you look around the world today, you will see how much unforgiveness,
    <br>hatred, strife, resentment, revenge has invaded the world.
    <br>There is so much division, confusion among brethren,
    <br>believers, families, business partners, marriages.
    <br>Satan keeps using every opposite of God's command to imprison man,
    <br>to trap man's heart to himself.
    <br>Are you ready to get loosed?
    <br>The Book of Ephesians 6:11 says we must put on the full armour of God
    <br>so that we may be able to fight against the wiles of the devil, his tricks, his games.
    <br>This is the good news.
    <br>When soldiers are going to war, they brace themselves,
    <br>they fortify themselves with weapons
    <br>such as bulletproof vests, helmets, spears -
    <br>all weapons of attack and tools of defence to fight their enemies.
    <br>But we Christians have a common enemy known as satan.
    <br>The Bible says that to withstand his wiles, you must brace yourself.
    <br>You must put on the armour which is God's righteousness
    <br>that comprises of forgiveness, love, peace, kindness,
    <br>gentleness, long-suffering, forbearance and endurance,
    <br>to protect the heart and ensure God's constant support.
    <br>We believers must protect ourselves, we must brace ourselves, we must fortify ourselves
    <br>with forgiveness at all times, patience, love, peace, joy
    <br>to protect the heart, to ensure God's constant support.
    <br>Each piece of armour has its own offensive as well as defensive use.
    <br>Forgiveness becomes our protection against the lies of the devil.
    <br>Love becomes our protection against the hatred of the adversary.
    <br>Whether you are the one that caused the pain or the receiver of the pain,
    <br>the offender or the offended - it is time to let go of all hurt so you can grow.
    <br>Brethren, viewers all over the world, those who are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>it is time for you to let go of all pain of the past so you can grow.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says the person that is most hurt by unforgiveness is you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The person that is most hurt by unforgiveness is me."
    <br>This brings us to the title of this message for you this morning:
    <br>LET IT GO SO YOU CAN GROW
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let it go so you can grow."
    <br>Let it go.
    <br>Let go of all pain, hurts, so you can grow.
    <br>I don't know how much pain you have in your heart.
    <br>Are you hurt in marriage, with your business partners, in your work,
    <br>office, relationship, community?
    <br>Just let it go so you can grow.
    <br>The Bible says that faith demands for a free heart, a free spirit - a heart that is not locked up by offence.
    <br>In the Book of Luke 11:4, when Jesus teaches all believers how to pray,
    <br>He asks us to make forgiveness the cornerstone of our relationship with Him.
    <br>To remain unforgiving shows we have not yet understood
    <br>that we ourselves deeply need to be forgiven.
    <br>If you have not forgiven those who hurt you, those who sinned against you,
    <br>those who derive joy in your sadness,
    <br>if you have not forgiven those who derive comfort in your discomfort,
    <br>those who criticise you, those who do not share the same faith with you -
    <br>if you do not forgive them, how then will God deal with you if He treats you as you treat them?
    <br>I'm not talking about those who love you.
    <br>If you fail to forgive those who derive joy in your sadness,
    <br>those who derive comfort in your discomfort,
    <br>those who criticise you - if you refuse to forgive them, how then will God deal with you
    <br>if He treats you as you treat them?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Everyone desires to climb the ladder of success, the ladder of breakthrough,
    <br>the ladder of healing and deliverance
    <br>but do you know that unforgiveness, revenge keep dragging our spiritual life down?
    <br>We all want to be there but do you imagine that unforgiveness, revenge,
    <br>anger, hatred keep dragging our spiritual lives down?
    <br>Many claim they have forgiven but are still struggling with forgetting.
    <br>Many say, "Well, I have forgiven but it is difficult to forget."
    <br>I want you to know that forgiveness involves two things: attitude and action.
    <br>If you find it difficult to forgive someone who hurt you, try responding with kind actions -
    <br>love and care for him or her.
    <br>Soon you will realise that right actions lead to right feelings.
    <br>Try and respond with love and care; soon you will realise that right actions lead to right feelings.
    <br>This reminds me of the parable of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Book of Luke 15
    <br>and this will be our proof text.
    <br>When you read the verses 11 to the end, you will realise that
    <br>our response to someone who makes a mistake can also be a mistake if we are not careful.
    <br>Let's quickly open our Bible to the Book of Luke 15
    <br>and let us read the parable about the lost son.
    <br>Let someone say, "Let go of all hurts so you can grow."
    <br>I will let go of all pain so I can grow.
    <br>Now, let's take it from verse 11:
    <br>"Then he said: 'A certain man had two sons.
    <br>And the younger of them said to his father,
    <br>'Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.'
    <br>So he divided to them his livelihood.
    <br>And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country,
    <br>and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living...' "
    <br>Let's go to verse 18.
    <br>Then the prodigal boy says:
    <br>"I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him,
    <br>'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,
    <br>and I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
    <br>Make me like one of your hired servants.'
    <br>And he arose and came to his father.
    <br>But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion,
    <br>and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
    <br>And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight,
    <br>and am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
    <br>But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe and put it on him,
    <br>and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
    <br>And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry'..."
    <br>Let's go to verse 25:
    <br>"Now his older son was in the field.
    <br>And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
    <br>So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
    <br>And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound,
    <br>your father has killed the fatted calf.' "
    <br>Verse 28, which is a vital lesson I want each and everyone of us to learn:
    <br>"But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.
    <br>So he answered and said to his father, 'Lo, these many years I have been serving you;
    <br>I never transgressed your commandment at any time;
    <br>and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.
    <br>But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots,
    <br>you killed the fatted calf for him.'
    <br>And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.
    <br>It was right that we should make merry and be glad,
    <br>for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.' "
    <br>What do we learn from this?
    <br>The older brother failed to realise that his response to someone who makes a mistake
    <br>can also be a mistake, if he is not careful.
    <br>Our response to someone who makes a mistake can also be a mistake, if we are not careful.
    <br>Sometimes we get angry and resentful that sinners are being welcomed into God's Kingdom
    <br>despite all they have done.
    <br>Little do we know how joyful, happy, pleasant Heaven gets when a sinner repents.
    <br>Many have rejected their prospective helpers on account of today.
    <br>The bad person, the worst person in your record today, brethren, may be your helper tomorrow,
    <br>even the helper of your family.
    <br>If you reject someone on account of their weakness, you will reject their strength as well.
    <br>This is the Gospel of God's grace that challenges and changes everything,
    <br>that causes the wolf to dwell with the lamb.
    <br>For those who are thinking, "I will do to him what he has done to me;
    <br>I am going to do to her what she has done to me",
    <br>those who believe in tit-for-tat,
    <br>remember Samson in the Book of Judges 15:1-end.
    <br>The Bible warns us against the self-destructive element,
    <br>the self-destructive monster called revenge.
    <br>Each act of retaliation leads to another.
    <br>Every attempt to revenge mostly affects the offended. Take note.
    <br>But the cycle of revenge can only be halted by forgiveness.
    <br>Therefore, forgiveness makes future possible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Forgiveness makes future possible."
    <br>Many today are seeking blessings, healing, deliverance for classic reasons, selfish reasons.
    <br>They say, "If I'm healed, I will deal with that man.
    <br>Just let me be strong. I'm weak now. When I'm strong, I will deal with him.
    <br>If I'm blessed, I will show him."
    <br>That is probably why God sometimes takes so much time in considering our request
    <br>because He alone knows the heart of man.
    <br>"I'm going to do to her what she has done to me.
    <br>Just let me get to that position, I will show him pepper."
    <br>Look! This probably is the reason God sometimes takes so much time
    <br>in considering our request because He alone knows the heart of man.
    <br>The Book of Romans 12:17-21 says do good to change the bad you see
    <br>because the forgiveness you show,
    <br>the patience and forbearance that grace your life will produce much fruit.
    <br>They will come back to you a hundredfold, perhaps long after you have forgotten them.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Are you misjudged, intimidated, falsely accused?
    <br>Don't let your emotions dominate you; you have to discipline your emotions.
    <br>Satan won't let you forget the wrong of others.
    <br>His desire is to trap you, to imprison your heart.
    <br>Those characteristics of offence - anger, malice, revenge - are liabilities to our lives;
    <br>they oftentimes nullify our prayers.
    <br>I don't know your situation, but I know Jesus knows.
    <br>If we are to follow our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, we must model His forgiveness.
    <br>Stop dredging up the ugly past of those who hurt you.
    <br>Offence must not break the relationship but strengthen it.
    <br>Misunderstanding must always lead to mutual understanding.
    <br>I am because you are.
    <br>Don't forget that we are one another's strength.
    <br>You are because I am and I am because you are.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need the right knowledge of God."
    <br>Anytime you are hurt, remember the right knowledge of God that settles peace.
    <br>When you receive the right knowledge of God, you will know:
    <br>Whether you are victims or perpetrators,
    <br>the offended or the offender, the accused or the accuser,
    <br>we all stand in helpless need of His divine forgiveness.
    <br>If you have the right knowledge of God, you will learn to leave all matters to God
    <br>and not to be a judge.
    <br>If you judge me, if I judge you, who will judge us on the last day?
    <br>If you look at yourself, you will see how much offence has caused in your life.
    <br>Offence causes setback when we hold on to it, when we feed on it,
    <br>when we filter everything through it.
    <br>We talk through it, we fight through it, we eat through it, we sleep through it
    <br>and that is most of the times the cause of bad dreams.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, those under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>it is high time for you to clear all the luggages and baggages of hurts that hold you hostage.
    <br>Let us rise up on our feet.
    <br>The Bible says that one of the great errands we have to the throne of grace
    <br>is to ask for the pardon of sin.
    <br>The Bible says there should not be anything between us and God,
    <br>if we want our prayers to be answered.
    <br>Unforgiveness is between us and God.
    <br>Anger, revenge, strife is between us and God.
    <br>Just look into your heart and say, "Lord!"
    <br>Open your heart because you are just a moment away from your freedom.
    <br>Think about those who hurt you.
    <br>Ask God to forgive your sin and give you the grace to forgive yourself
    <br>because our problem is, we don't forgive ourselves, making it difficult to forgive others.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to forgive yourself and to forgive others.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, no one is permitted to hold on to offence
    <br>since the offence is poison to our future.
    <br>It opens the door to depression, stagnation, failure, disappointment.
    <br>Open your heart.
    <br>Mean it with all your heart and release whoever.
    <br>Ask God to forgive you.
    <br>Ask Him to give you the grace to forgive others.
    <br>Mean it in your heart.
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to hold you hostage -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That chain of unforgiveness, anger, revenge - whatever chain satan might have used
    <br>to hold you hostage - be released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be released from all grips of satan, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be released from all clutches, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be released from all pains of the past, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Today marks the beginning of a new dawn.
    <br>Just let go!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Finally brethren, please quickly turn with me to the Book of Ephesians 4:2.
    <br>"With all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,
    <br>endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
    <br>There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling."
    <br>Let's go to the verse 31.
    <br>"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice.
    <br>And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
    <br>even as God in Christ forgave you."
    <br>Love one another, just as Christ forgives and loves each and everyone of us.
    <br>The faith armour protects our heart against the devil's fiery arrows.
    <br>With God's perspective, we can see beyond our intimidation.
    <br>With God's perspective, we can see beyond false accusations.
    <br>With God's perspective, we can see beyond intimidation;
    <br>we can know that ultimate victory is ours.
    <br>If we are to follow God, we must model His forgiveness.
    <br>If we find it difficult to forgive someone who hurt us, try responding with kind actions -
    <br>love and care for him.
    <br>Soon, you will realise that right actions lead to right feelings.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua says:
    <br>Love forgets wrong so that there will be hope for the future.
    <br>Love for fellow men breaks down all barriers.
    <br>It melts all hindrances.
    <br>It dissolves prejudice and suspicion.
    <br>Love has ears to hear the heart of both the saved and the unsaved.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says:
    <br>The love you give away is the only love you keep.
    <br>How much love have you given away today?
    <br>How much forgiveness have you given away today?
    <br>If you can let go of those hurts of the past, God will do exceedingly, abundantly
    <br>above all that you ask or think.
    <br>If you can let go of all those pains, healing will find you today, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>If you can let go of all the pain of the past, breakthrough will find you today,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You will have a new dream; your dream will be clear.
    <br>You will be surrounded by God's mercy; you will be surrounded by God's favour.
    <br>Just let it go so you can grow.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart, in Jesus' name!
