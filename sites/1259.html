  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, thank you.
    <br>Those under dominion, those under bondage of sickness, disease -
    <br>receive freedom, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>To be greedy as well - "receive, receive" - is bondage.
    <br>It is bondage because when you believe in "receive, receive", you can never grow.
    <br>You must be a cheerful person - a cheerful giver, first to God.
    <br>First to God is sacrifice - what you cherish, what you love most, what your life depends on.
    <br>You look at your wardrobe - you are giving what you have not been using.
    <br>You give it to friends - you can give it sometimes but many times (give) what your life depends on,
    <br>what you cherish most.
    <br>You have to balance your life - what you do not need, what you need.
    <br>If you give sometimes what you do not need, come back again - what you need.
    <br>What you do not need, what you need.
    <br>Not all the time what you do not need.
    <br>If God was giving you what you do not need, how would your life look like?
    <br>Whatever you do to the least out there, that you do to God.
    <br>Like I have said: They need you more than we need you here.
    <br>In terms of finances, support, your neighbour needs you more than we need you here.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Those under bondage, those under dominion of sickness, disease -
    <br>receive freedom, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command deliverance on you right now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command deliverance on you now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can see the downfall of satan.
    <br>I command deliverance on you now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I command healing on you now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Jesus heals every disease, every infirmity, every wound - be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>This is freedom!
    <br>Freedom!
    <br>Right now, begin to fix your life.
    <br>Begin to fix your life by the authority of Jesus.
    <br>Fix your life!
    <br>Fix your marriage!
    <br>Fix your career!
    <br>Fix your family!
    <br>Fix your health!

    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>The authority that pulled down the walls of Jericho,
    <br>right now, begin to pull down, tear down, destroy every demonic stronghold in your life,
    <br>every demonic stronghold between you and God's promises -
    <br>right now, begin to tear it down!
    <br>Pull it down!
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>The SCOAN Altar
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan!
    <br>In your life, I have seen.
    <br>Confess it.
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan!
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan in my business!
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan in my life!
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan in my marriage!
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan in my career!
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Let the people of God say, "Amen!"
    <br>Merry Christmas!
    <br>Happy New Year!
