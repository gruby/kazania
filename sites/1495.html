    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>How often do you say, "Thank You, Jesus"?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>I am very sure you have never said "Thank You, Jesus" since morning
    <br>because you don't know how much you need Jesus.
    <br>You don't know.
    <br>You just believe you need Jesus for a big miracle.
    <br>When you have a problem, you run to Him and He solves the problem -
    <br>that is what you need Jesus for.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You don't know how much you need Jesus".
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>If you know how much you need Jesus,
    <br>when you walk to another room, you will say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>When you sit down in your car to drive, you will say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>When you stop at the traffic lights, you will say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>That does not mean you are crazy; out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
    <br>You cannot live above your words.
    <br>As a Christian, if truly you are a believer,
    <br>when you say "A", it's A; when you say "B", it's B.
    <br>You cannot live above your words.
    <br>When you see a beautiful aspect of nature, you will say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Instead, you say, "Ah!"
    <br>When you pause to wash your hands or comb you hair, you will say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You need to know how much you need Jesus.
    <br>I was expecting everyone to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"

    <br>That does not mean you say it without your heart; you must say it with all your heart.
    <br>Out of abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

    <br>The first person you think of in the morning
    <br>and the last person you think of in the night should be Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>I believe you will cultivate this habit.
    <br>Are you ready to build this habit?
    <br>When you stand up, you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Sit down - "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Are you sure you will continue this?
    <br>The SECRET Of My Life ðŸ˜ƒ| TB JOSHUA Reveals!!!
    <br>You just have to confess whom you are.
    <br>You have not been confessing whom you are.
    <br>Look at me; before I turn, "Thank You, Jesus..."
    <br>I want to call someone there; before I do, I say, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me the grace to call".
    <br>But you don't know how much you need Jesus.
    <br>Try to talk to your neighbour; before then, say, "Thank You, Jesus!" in your heart.
    <br>No! Don't say it aloud but in your heart.
    <br>Talk to your neighbour.
    <br>So, you say, "Thank You, Jesus", before you talk to your neighbour.
    <br>Even before greeting your neighbour, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>If all what you are doing for God's sake...
    <br>How often do you deliberately try to keep a smile on your face for God's sake?
    <br>The SECRET Of My Life ðŸ˜ƒ| TB JOSHUA Reveals!!!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>That is my life.
    <br>I'm taking another step, I say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Back - "Thank You, Jesus" because I know how much I need Jesus.
    <br>Without Him, I will fall.
    <br>And I don't want you to take me unprepared.
    <br>I don't want you to attack me unprepared.
    <br>This is why any time you give me a call and say, "Hello",
    <br>before I answer you, I always pause, delay because I need to say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You say, "Hello".
    <br>"Who is on the line?"
    <br>I will say, "Thank You, Jesus" before I say who is on the line.
    <br>But you - "Hello! Hello! ...", without asking for the grace.
    <br>You need corresponding power.
    <br>You live by corresponding power - power from above.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I live by corresponding power - the power from above".
    <br>The life you live is not yours.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Don't forget what you are taking home now, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You must know how much you need Him.
    <br>You need Him to laugh; you need Him to walk.
    <br>You need Him to turn round; you need Him to greet.
    <br>Every moment - "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Thank Him for giving you the grace to do that.
    <br>Hallelujah!
