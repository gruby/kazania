    <br>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW with WINNIE MANDELA
    <br>Get ready to be astounded as you listen to an exclusive interview with the world famous Winnie Mandela.
    <br>Emmanuel TV caught up with her when she came to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>to celebrate the 40th birthday of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Be blessed as you watch, in Jesus' name.
    <br>As you would know, this is the grandmother of Africa Winnie Mandela.
    <br>Let me just assume that my continent knows more about me then I know about myself.
    <br>It's absolutely wonderful to be here.
    <br>It's like a continuation of my family in South Africa.
    <br>Thank you very much, madam, we appreciate your time here with us today
    <br>and we do know that our viewers around the world, not only in Africa, do know Mrs. Winnie Mandela.
    <br>And we thank you for your time once again, in Jesus' name.
    <br>It is a great pleasure.
    <br>You have spent a couple of days here at The Synagogue, Church of all Nations with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and we wanted to just ask you a few questions concerning your experience and time here at the church.
    <br>We know that you are a mother of Africa, we would like to ask you:
    <br>If you were a mother of Prophet T.B. Joshua, what would be the advice you would have to give to him?
    <br>I must say that I have been so pleasantly surprised
    <br>by the power in this young man, our Prophet.
    <br>I think that everyone who has been here is never the same, after experiencing what I experienced yesterday
    <br>and I wish I had been here longer to be part and parcel of this family -
    <br>Africa's most important religious family.
    <br>The experience I found was invaluable.
    <br>What struck me most, above everything was to notice the age of his congregation
    <br>and I am absolutely amazed at him, being able to attract so much of the younger generation
    <br>which is our problem, especially in South Africa.
    <br>With all these modern styles of life in South Africa, for instance,
    <br>we are almost losing the battle against substance abuse, the introduction of drugs and liquor,
    <br>and all the vices that go with the development of a society that has just transited from a very painful past.
    <br>You try to define democracy and at the beginning it is extremely difficult
    <br>for even adults to adjust to what in fact democracy is.
    <br>I think, Africa needs to redefine the concept of democracy.
    <br>There has to be democracy of a special type, applicable to our continent.
    <br>With the advent of democracy in our country, for instance,
    <br>that has brought quite a lot of problems.
    <br>I see here how our Prophet has been able engage the youth
    <br>to the extent that on their own - I saw them coming in their thousands in and out of church.
    <br>I just wish I could take him to South Africa and plant him in the middle of our country
    <br>and show the youth that there is still a way.
    <br>There is still a way we can at least accommodate their fears and challenges in modern South Africa.
    <br>What I have seen here is absolutely remarkable.
    <br>I think, part of the solution for this country is the fact that this country has stuck to its culture.
    <br>Although there is a lot westernization, you see the identity of a country, you see a Nigerian,
    <br>even when they walk in the streets of South Africa - you see that it is a Nigerian.
    <br>That is part of what has retained this society, that mysterious glue that keeps the country together,
    <br>particularly the youth.
    <br>That is what he has been able to achieve through the Word of God.
    <br>Amen! Thank you very much for those comments.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua teaches that we must commit more faith and love into the society 
    <br>which we are a part by giving more on others, spending more on others and less on our selves.
    <br>You have much experience in life as a mother to Africa, and you have seen the ups and downs of life.
    <br>You have seen those that have succeeded and those that have failed in life.
    <br>As a mother from this stand point, what would be your advise to the Prophet in his ministry, in this regard?
    <br>I have been watching your programmes.
    <br>In fact, I have done nothing else but watch Emmanuel TV
    <br>and I am amazed at the amount of work the church is doing
    <br>which in South Africa is actually covered by a Ministry.
    <br>We have a Ministry of Social Development.
    <br>In this country, the Prophet is doing so much for the underprivileged, poor and physically challenged.
    <br>It is hard to give any advice to a person who seems to have just encompassed everything 
    <br>that society needs to be kept together.
    <br>With what he is doing, I wish his example could really be copied by the rest of the continent.
    <br>I think the amount of work he is doing for this country and the youth of this land is so remarkable.
    <br>It is a project, actually it is a style of life that should be emulated by the rest of the continent.
    <br>It is absolutely admirable.
    <br>We pray to God that He gives him the strength to continue being the inspiration for rest of the continent.
    <br>I cannot commend him enough.
    <br>I think that what he does is only a gift from God.
    <br>You are blessed to have him here.
    <br>In fact, the continent of Africa is blessed to have a man like him.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>We know that in life we pass through so many vicissitudes and calamities,
    <br>the Word of God teaches that in the university of God that you will take every course,
    <br>that there will be no double promotion, you must take every course along the road -
    <br>that could be black mail, name calling, insults, pleasure, pressure and tension.
    <br>What would you say concerning these aspects
    <br>that the Prophet has passed through in the course of building this ministry?
    <br>That is what makes him.
    <br>Those are the tests he actually needs to give him the strength he has today.
    <br>If life was that smooth and he didn't have challenges,
    <br>he wouldn't have the strength of character and be the man he is, the man who is so godly
    <br>and who really has supreme powers that are not of this world.
    <br>I think he has had the blessings from above, from the supernatural power.
    <br>It is absolutely important for us to rally around him and give him inspiration.
    <br>He is too far above even bothering about things like name calling.
    <br>We hear that type of thing in South Africa every time.
    <br>I think he is too far above that.
    <br>Those are just the pressures of life he needs for him to focus and continue being the man he is.
    <br>If he didn't have that, he wouldn't have the strength of  character he has.
    <br>Those are things, the issues that make him the man he is and God's son.
    <br>Our struggles make us stronger, they are not meant to impair us but to improve us for the glory of God.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>We do know that society, the world at large is in need of so much.
    <br>They are always in want of one thing or the other.
    <br>What advise would you have as far as getting the message and the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to those who can make use of the ministry, most of those people in position of influence
    <br>that can assist to bring this message and this ministry to those around the world that are in need of it?
    <br>He is truly one of a kind.
    <br>He exudes that nature which says, he does everything for others and nothing for himself.
    <br>He is so selfless in his approach and style of worship.
    <br>I wish there was a way for the continent to emulate his style of worship
    <br>because we need it through out the world.
    <br>All of the finery and opulence around him cannot be seen on him, it is seen on all those who are around him.
    <br>He is so down to earth, so unassuming.
    <br>If all religious leaders were like him, I think millions and millions might have been saved,
    <br>as he is doing with the youth here in this country.
    <br>What we should do is just encourage him to carry on the wonderful work he is doing.
    <br>One wishes the rest of the denominations could emulate him.
    <br>I wish I could just take him and put him in the center of South Africa.
    <br>Not that I am undermining our own denominations in any way, but we can always learn from each other.
    <br>I would personally encourage even our ministers, in our various denominations and ministries,
    <br>I would encourage them to pay a visit and just see how the continent of Africa worships,
    <br>particularly his style of worship.
    <br>Amen! Thank you very much, madam, and we appreciate the time you have spent with us today
    <br>and the wonderful words that you have spoken.
    <br>We would like to ask you on a personal note about your purpose for visiting The SCOAN
    <br>and what lesson or what you are taking home with you?
    <br>I really came here to gain some inspiration and renewal within myself and my worship.
    <br>I came here to be recharged in my religious beliefs.
    <br>I believe I got just what I wanted.
    <br>I had been looking forward to meeting him.
    <br>We love him very dearly in South Africa.
    <br>Literally, every young person who has had problems in life, their dream is to come here to get his blessings
    <br>and to get his direction to follow in their lives.
    <br>I don't even think he's aware of the amount of love South Africa has for him.
    <br>He is a renowned preacher.
    <br>I think if there were means, hundreds of people would be flocking here,
    <br>if it wasn't a question of resources to get here.
    <br>So, as a grandmother, I had long wanted to meet this young man who is so blessed.
    <br>I can imagine how his parents must feel.
    <br>He is so young to be a Prophet, I think he is God's very special person.
    <br>He has been anointed by the Almighty Himself to carry His Word.
    <br>We should all help him to live up to that because I think he is just a special blessing to our continent.
    <br>Amen! Thank you very much, madam.
    <br>We have been speaking with Mrs. Winnie Mandela, here at The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria
    <br>where she has spent a couple of days with us and also attended the June 12th celebration
    <br>of Prophet T.B. Joshua's birthday.
    <br>Do you have a special birthday message for the man of God, Prophet T.B.Joshua?
    <br>I wish him the happiest birthday
    <br>and of course, he is going to have many more returns in his life.
    <br>One of the greatest returns is the fact he is a blessing to our continent and we are blessed to have him.
    <br>He is God's very special son and ours.
    <br>I am proud to be his parent and I claim him to be my son.
    <br>Thank you very much, madam!
    <br>We have just spoken with Mrs. Winnie Mandela here at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>Thank you again for your time and words.
    <br>For all those that are watching out there, remember that we want to keep you in our special prayers
    <br>knowing that prayer is the master key
    <br>and the best way to show someone that you love them is to continue to pray for them.
    <br>Thank you very much for your time and words.
    <br>Pleasure, thank you very much.
    <br>It is really from the Grandmother of Africa, Winnie Mandela.
    <br>Just keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>If you want your dreams realized in any aspect of your life, keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I expect my children of Africa to listen to me,
    <br>I am literally giving them an order to keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We from Africa should tell the rest of the world that the thing to do is to keep watching Emmanuel TV.
