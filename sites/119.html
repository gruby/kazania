    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mariana Parkhotyuk and I am from Washington State, USA.
    <br>It started when I came to The SCOAN last year for Prophet T.B. Joshua's 49th birthday.
    <br>He told the congregation, 'This is the day you will remember,
    <br>the day of your breakthrough in you career, finances and all issues in your life.'
    <br>I took that for myself.
    <br>I also had the privilege to meet Prophet T.B. Joshua and I received the Anointing Water.
    <br>I went back to the USA and after a few months, a job position opened.
    <br>As you can see here, this was the job that was open.
    <br>The job description states, 'Clinical Application Specialist'.
    <br>I was working as a front office assistant before I applied for this job position.
    <br>I have underlined the qualifications, education
    <br>and also the experience needed for this job position.
    <br>Church of God, this job position required me to have four years of experience
    <br>as well as a degree;
    <br>I did not have anything within these job description qualifications.
    <br>As I began the interview process, I had to go through three interviews.
    <br>In the first two interviews, they rebuked me
    <br>and told me that I was not qualified for this position.
    <br>Before the third and last interview, I took this piece of paper and the Anointing Water
    <br>and said, "Lord, You qualify the unqualified."
    <br>Praise the Lord! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>After the last interview - the third one, they called me a few weeks later
    <br>and told me that I had received the job position.
    <br>Not only did I receive the job position, I got a double increase in my salary.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>After some time, they sent me to a certain place out of State
    <br>so that I could receive certification so that I can work in my job.
    <br>These are the two certificates.
    <br>They sent me and paid for my accommodation and education
    <br>and I received these certificates enabling me to work in this job.
    <br>Glory be to God. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to let all the viewers around the world and everyone sitting here know
    <br>that the reason I could not have a job promotion
    <br>was because every time I tried to go to school, I would not have the funds.
    <br>I would always go but never finish because I was always limited with finances.
    <br>With this job position, not only did I get an increase in pay
    <br>but they are also helping me to go back to school.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Our sister is saying that not only did she receive that promotion and a higher position,
    <br>it came along with a higher salary, education and training.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>After this wonderful breakthrough that you have received through the medium of the Anointing Water,
    <br>what is your advice to viewers around the world?
    <br>Church of God and all the viewers around the world, God can do the impossible
    <br>and He can choose any medium to express Himself.
    <br>He chose the medium of the Anointing Water to express Himself,
    <br>His goodness, His mercy and His grace.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Mrs Mariana Parkhotyuk
