  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>Viewers, Good Morning!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have done my own dance.
    <br>I would have shown it now, but I have been dancing since...
    <br>I was a viewer but now here I am.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am looking forward to see when you will allow me put on a suit;
    <br>when some of your spirits will allow me to put on a suit, when we will not fight.
    <br>That is why I had to dress this way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All I'm saying, "Allow me to wear a tie".
    <br>You will allow me one day to wear a tie.
    <br>This issue of faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>It has given me so much concern.
    <br>People are not going through faith to talk to God anymore.
    <br>People imagine God hears them -
    <br>that is imagination.
    <br>To learn how to believe that God hears us when we pray is a much greater blessing
    <br>than healing and deliverance.
    <br>Just name them.
    <br>But how many of us today...?
    <br>You stand up to pray, "Lord Jesus", and you know He is hearing you, and you are hearing Him -
    <br>how many of you, how many of us today?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>“To learn how to believe that God hears us when we pray is a much greater blessing
    <br>than healing, deliverance and whatever you are waiting for.”
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because the prayer of faith can be repeated a thousand times.
    <br>"Jesus, give me bread" - Jesus may say, "Hold on. Not that I will not give you but hold on.
    <br>It is not the right time to give you".
    <br>That does not mean that your prayer is not answered.
    <br>"Jesus, I want to run."
    <br>"Hmm. This is not the right thing for you now to run."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus prayed that the cup be taken away from Him three times;
    <br>the same prayer He offered three times.
    <br>That does not mean His prayer was not answered.
    <br>That cup should be taken from Him - three times.
    <br>Let's quickly take a look at the Book of Matthew 26.
    <br>Take our reading from verse 36.
    <br>It says, “Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them,
    <br>‘Sit here while I go over there and pray.’"
    <br>That said Jesus to His disciples.
    <br>“He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
    <br>Then he said to them, ‘My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.
    <br>Stay here and keep watch with me.’
    <br>Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed,
    <br>‘My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.’
    <br>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.
    <br>‘Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?’ he asked Peter.
    <br>‘Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’"
    <br>Verse 42:
    <br>“He went away a second time and prayed, ‘My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away
    <br>unless I drink it, may your will be done.’
    <br>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.
    <br>So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.”
    <br>That is prayer of faith, saying the same thing, and then He returned to the disciples.
    <br>Take your time to read.
    <br>FAITH ABOUT ETERNITY
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>To base faith on our improvement after prayer is oftentimes very disappointing.
    <br>Oftentimes, very what?
    <br>Very disappointing.
    <br>"God, give me bread" - and you base your faith on that - the outcome; bread.
    <br>If the bread does not come, you will be disappointed.
    <br>It works with the will of God and the promise of God; all together.
    <br>What is His will?
    <br>That is what faith works on.
    <br>Is it His will to give you bread, wait a while or not to give you bread?
    <br>According to His will we pray; according to His promise we pray.
    <br>Jesus prayed that the cup be taken away from Him three times.
    <br>"Cup, be taken away from Me."
    <br>Another time again, "Cup, be taken away from Me."
    <br>Three times.
    <br>The prayer of faith can be repeated a thousand times.
    <br>This is why the Bible encourages us in 1 Thessalonians 5:16 to pray without ceasing.
    <br>It says, prayer without what?
    <br>Ceasing.
    <br>Prayer without ceasing
    <br>because our troubles, challenges and situations are instruments that maintain our union with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “My challenges and situations are instruments to maintain my union with God”.
    <br>My challenges, I mean, my troubles are instruments to maintain my oneness with God,
    <br>to maintain my relationship with God.
    <br>But today, the opposite is the case to you.
    <br>It is time you begin to see your challenge as a friend.
    <br>As Christians, when we pray to God to remove our troubles,
    <br>when the troubles are not removed, an equivalent will be provided.
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>This is an equivalent.
    <br>That is...
    <br>Where God guides, you find yourself
    <br>where His grace will be sufficient to protect you while you are going through the problem.
    <br>Even though that situation is there, but you are strong in the Lord.
    <br>That brought about our relationship.
    <br>If not your situation, you would not know me.
    <br>If not your situation, I would not know you.
    <br>Where will I know you from? A club house?
    <br>Where will I know you from? A party?
    <br>Where will I know you from?
    <br>I would not know you!
    <br>You are welcome!
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Can you say, "Thank you, my situation"?
    <br>Thank you, my situation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You keep burdening yourself.
    <br>You keep being worried, troubled because of your situation.
    <br>When situation comes, it is time to grow stronger in the Lord.
    <br>As Christians, we must know that our values must be tested against facts and experiences.
    <br>Your value must be tested.
    <br>You say, "What is my value? How much am I worth?"
    <br>If you are no one, nobody will notice, nobody will bother you.
    <br>Each time people talk, "T.B. Joshua, T.B. Joshua" - the name is disturbing them.
    <br>That is a value.
    <br>If I'm no one, nobody will talk about me, nobody will want to attack me or challenge me.
    <br>People believe challenging me is making a name for themselves
    <br>because of value - what I'm worth.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People want to write an article in their newspaper, "T.B. Joshua..." - just because they want it to sell.
    <br>Look at the Emmanuel TV channel - it is the most watched Christian channel all over the world.
    <br>That is the value.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You must know that your values must be tested against facts and experiences.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “My values must be tested against facts and experiences”.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"No. Why all this?"
    <br>Why do you not want to pay a price for your values?
    <br>We should ask you, if you truly believe in them, in your values...
    <br>Do you believe in them?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What people say about you; people do this, people hate you, people do that; attack, this and that...
    <br>Some of us here are looking for values; they want to create that value for themselves.
    <br>You see them when everywhere is quiet,
    <br>and in a moment where there is no movement, that is when you see them coming out.
    <br>They want people to see them.
    <br>That is how they create values for themselves.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The case of Peter serves as a good example of what we are talking about.
    <br>Assume Peter would have caught fish earlier, he would have missed the redemption.
    <br>This shows his wasted hours on the sea kept him for a new level in life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your sickness can keep you for a new level.
    <br>Your disappointment can keep you for a new level.
    <br>Failure can keep one for a new level.
    <br>Hatred, persecution and temptation can do the same; it will keep you.
    <br>You keep saying, "My colleagues are going; see my colleagues - they are there, they are making money,
    <br>I don't have a job, joblessness..."
    <br>And you don't know that God is keeping you for a new level.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What are the things you are praying for whose answer seems to delay?
    <br>Maybe God wants to keep you for a new level.
    <br>Maybe God is keeping or preserving you
    <br>to strengthen your desire and your determination for Him.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, “What are the things you are praying for whose answer seems to delay?”
    <br>Maybe God wants to preserve you.
    <br>Maybe God wants to keep you for a new level.
    <br>Maybe God wants to strengthen your desire and your determination for Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you meet any successful person today, they would tell you.
    <br>If you meet a wonderful married couple, they would tell you what they went through to be there.
    <br>If you meet the person you call your role model today,
    <br>they would tell you what it takes to be your role model.
    <br>As you count your blessings every day, take time to also count your failures.
    <br>There is a school for failure and a school for blessing.
    <br>What we are saying has nothing to do with age.
    <br>Because you consider your age for everything you do.
    <br>It has nothing to do with family; you consider your family in everything you do.
    <br>It has nothing to do with education, human natural gift, because you consider all this,
    <br>"I'm a graduate, I'm a professor. I have been to this or that place, I have travelled all over the world.
    <br>See this man there - he is illiterate and I am a professor."
    <br>It has nothing to do with it.
    <br>By acting faith, you can only fetch in grace.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>“By acting faith, you can only fetch in grace that will enable you to do what is impossible.”
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know, I take my time to talk to you.
    <br>No!
    <br>I really want to talk to you.
    <br>Say, “I really want to talk to you”.
    <br>That is why you don't see me doing this...
    <br>I'm expecting somebody to shout, "Pastor! Hey!", while you are quiet.
    <br>I'm expecting to jump, "Yes!"
    <br>"Help me to jump, I want to see!" - "Hey!" - "More, more, more!"
    <br>You don't need more of this, you just need the one God wants me to give to you.
    <br>You keep opening the door God has not opened.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You keep opening the door God has not opened".
    <br>Can you see? This is why many of you are like this.
    <br>You keep taking what God has not given you.
    <br>You keep opening the door God has not opened.
    <br>You keep taking what God has not given you.
    <br>That is why it is difficult to live long with those things.
    <br>At the time you need those things, they are not there for you
    <br>because you take it when God has not given you.
    <br>Much fame, popularity, wealth has shivered today.
    <br>If God has given you, He gives you for the children yet unborn to live and see.
    <br>This is why you see our life epileptic today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At the time you are not strong, the thing is no longer there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “We keep taking what God has not given us.
    <br>We keep opening the door that God has not opened".
    <br>That is, the blessings, wealth and fame of many today.
    <br>The joy of the blessing and the fame is to see it when you are no longer living.
    <br>Die and leave it behind.
    <br>You are not blessed only for this generation but for the generation yet unborn.
    <br>If the apostles had died with their achievements, people like me would not be here today.
    <br>I’m a partaker of an inheritance of saints.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, you can still return what God has no given you and you wait for what God is about to give you.
    <br>It is not too late.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Return what you have not been given and wait for what God is about to give”.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are the challenges all over the world.
    <br>Not only you; the nation, the continent, the world.
    <br>Every aspect of life - marriage, business, career, this and that.
    <br>If God has not given you and you take it...
    <br>Not that you would not be able to take it - you can take it when God...
    <br>The Bible says, "The blessing I give, not as the world gives them".
    <br>You can take, even when God has not given you - no problem.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>I want someone to smile with me, I want someone to smile here.
    <br>You are too frowned.
    <br>Why are you too frowned?
    <br>Let me believe you, you are too frowned.
    <br>Smile!
    <br>Or you have taken what God has not given you?
    <br>Smile, smile, smile.
    <br>Oh no, this is not real.
    <br>I want that kind of smile.
    <br>Let me hear you.
    <br>What are you saying there?
    <br>You say you will return it?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Such a wonderful time having you around me.
    <br>Do you know I love you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How do you know?
    <br>How do you know that I love you?
    <br>Because I have a question I want to ask you, "How do you know I love you?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you love me?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>You love me because you come to the church?
    <br>No!
    <br>Yes, no worries - time will tell.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Time will tell".
    <br>Do you know what I mean by "time will tell"?
    <br>How can you be inside the church and say that you hate me?
    <br>You are inside the church and you are looking at me and you say, "I hate you".
    <br>It is very difficult; time will tell - when you are out there, we will know.
    <br>Time will tell - it is a matter of time.
    <br>The question I'm asking is not even relevant.
    <br>How can I be looking at you and say, "Love me"; what will I be expecting from you?
    <br>Three much!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have not asked me whether I love you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No, ask me - I know you know I love you.
    <br>Ask me this question.
    <br>Do you love us?
    <br>OK, you say what?
    <br>Do you love us?
    <br>OK, thank you for loving me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That will answer. Thank you for loving me.
    <br>Because you say you love me -  reciprocate.
    <br>If you love me, I love you.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>That can work.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
