    <br>Good Morning, people of God!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, Good Morning!"
    <br>Greet the viewers, say, "Viewers, Good Morning!"
    <br>Indeed, Good Morning to your life today!
    <br>Good Morning to your career!
    <br>Good Morning to your life!
    <br>Good Morning to your destiny!
    <br>It is a new dawn!
    <br>Do you believe that? Say, "Thank You, Jesus". Give thanks to Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Have your seat in His presence.
    <br>That joy shall be permanent.
    <br>It shall be permanent.
    <br>Please, forget the trouble that brought you here; it is no more a trouble.
    <br>Forget that problem that brought you here; it is no longer a problem because Jesus is alive.
    <br>Jesus is alive!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for the grace to be here today.
    <br>My name is Racine.
    <br>I am an evangelist here by the grace of God under my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As you see me, God has done a miracle in my life.
    <br>If you saw me where I was before,
    <br>you would never believe that such a man could stand in your presence today.
    <br>God has visited my life through Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and today, the same God will touch your life.
    <br>I want you to have the assurance I have today.
    <br>You may be having trouble deep inside your heart.
    <br>Trouble must have brought you here, but let me tell you,
    <br>there is Someone somewhere who is aware of your situation.
    <br>No matter how long you have been in darkness, the light shines.
    <br>The Scripture says, the prophetic light is the light shining in the darkness.
    <br>When you come out of darkness, you remain faithful to the light forever - Jesus is the light.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for my life.
    <br>Brethren, I want to just tell you a very short story about me.
    <br>Like many African people here,
    <br>we believe that the greener pastures are when we go to the western world - that,  I did.
    <br>I lived there for twenty-two years - worked with people, met different people.
    <br>I thought I had 'arrived' - on the outside.
    <br>But one day, after eighteen years, something happened.
    <br>Something happened that turned my life around.
    <br>All that I counted dear, important, collapsed in one day.
    <br>That business I was proud of collapsed.
    <br>That relationship I was into for so long collapsed in one day - on the eve of Christmas, 1998.
    <br>I found myself stranded in a foreign country where I knew nobody.
    <br>I found myself on the streets, stranded - nowhere to go. I did not know anybody.
    <br>I had my bag and the phone I had switched off.
    <br>I was roaming about with nowhere to go, on a Christmas day.
    <br>That day my whole life said: "Is this what you have come to do in this country?
    <br>What are you going to do? What is the way out?"
    <br>Imagine what can go through the heart of such a person
    <br>Happening on the day of Christmas - everybody in his home fellowshipping, dancing and dining.
    <br>I was looking for a hotel and I could not find any.
    <br>I entered one hotel one day.
    <br>I was overwhelmed.
    <br>I entered that room tired, and I slept.
    <br>And I had a dream.
    <br>I dreamt - I saw a mountain, a very high mountain and I was like a baby
    <br>â€“ eight months old baby wearing diapers.
    <br>I looked at the mountain - so high.
    <br>When I turned, I saw a man, as tall as the mountain - a black man, having a beard.
    <br>I looked at the mountain; I looked at the man. I said, "How can I go there?"
    <br>I looked at the man; the man looked at me and smiled.
    <br>I woke up.
    <br>When I woke up, something strange happened to me.
    <br>There was a small light, as if you lit a candle
    <br>At that moment, I said, "Who is this man?"
    <br>My focus changed immediately. I forgot about my trouble.
    <br>I said, "Who is this man?"
    <br>I looked for that man - from town to town.
    <br>I travelled to different countries to look for that man.
    <br>Anytime I heard, "There is man of God here", I ran there.
    <br>After four years, my life had not changed - the trouble was still there.
    <br>One day, I said, "God, if that dream is true, I will not allow water or food to enter my mouth
    <br>until you reveal to me that person".
    <br>For good six to seven days, I was there. And something happened.
    <br>Let somebody say, "Something happened".
    <br>On Monday, a friend called me and said, "Let's go to the prayer meeting
    <br>because they are going to show something very special and very strange".
    <br>So I went there.
    <br>What I saw shocked me.
    <br>The man I saw in the dream - they were calling that man, "The Man In The Synagogue".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When they played that video, I saw a man sitting on the ground -
    <br>the buttocks were eaten by worms.
    <br>The man was abandoned; I was shocked to see the image.
    <br>I said, "How can this person live?"
    <br>Immediately, he came and prayed for that man.
    <br>When I saw the video, the man was healed, delivered - as if he was never sick.
    <br>I said, "This is the man".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Live Service
    <br>I began to say God: "How can I go there, how can I see him?"
    <br>I slept and another dream came, showing me the map of Africa.
    <br>Nigeria was like a heartbeat.
    <br>When I got to my office the next day, I told my boss, "I want to go to Nigeria".
    <br>He looked at me and said, "What happened to you? Are you crazy?"
    <br>I said, "No. There is a prophet there; I want to go and see him".
    <br>Before I realised it, he came to me, took a cheque book,
    <br>signed a cheque and got my ticket.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, I came here on February 2002.
    <br>On that fateful Sunday Service, the prophet saw me in his office.
    <br>When I entered, I couldn't talk. He gave me this.
    <br>This paper you see, has now been with me for good 16 years.
    <br>He looked at me and said, "What are you doing? God has a plan for you".
    <br>My dear brother,
    <br>if you don't know where you are destined to be, your destiny will be changed forever.
    <br>He gave me this; I took it and I read.
    <br>It says, "God will give you all that He has for His heirs".
    <br>That day, I understood that I am a child of promise.
    <br>So I wrote on the back: Sunday, 3 March 2002.
    <br>Immediately I read, something crossed my mind and said,
    <br>"If you believe in God, you will succeed. If you believe His prophet, you will prosper".
    <br>So, I went to the Scriptures and wrote down 2 Chronicles 20:20.
    <br>Today, my dream has come to pass.
    <br>What I want to tell you:
    <br>We are living in a world full of trouble but that trouble you are in today,
    <br>God may use it to release you to your future.
    <br>I'm telling you this to let you know that:
    <br>If you are in a situation, if what you are feeling in your heart is contrary to your heart's desire,
    <br>pause, take the time to change your focus, right now.
    <br>Stop thinking about your problem and start engaging your heart with God.
    <br>There is something in you that you need to discover.
    <br>Can I ask you one question?
    <br>How clearly do you see the world around you today?
    <br>When you look at your own life, what do you see?
    <br>When you look at your life, what do you see?
    <br>If you say you see setback, limitation, poverty, trouble, let me ask you the following question:
    <br>What does Jesus see when He is looking at you?
    <br>There is more to life than meets the ordinary eye -
    <br>there is man's point of view and we have eternity's perspective.
    <br>Which one is ruling your life today?
    <br>Look around you and you will see that many people are complaining, lamenting, crying,
    <br>weeping every day because their lives are centred, focused on what they are doing,
    <br>how they are feeling, how they are treated.
    <br>Worry destroys our sense of judgement; it makes the heart sick.
    <br>It affects your heart.
    <br>And the prophet says, our behavior is determined by the condition of our heart.
    <br>If you confess failure, you put failure on the throne.
    <br>Are you complaining about your life today?
    <br>if you do, it's because your heart is that way.
    <br>If you complain, it means your heart is that way.
    <br>With your complaints, you are constantly painting a public picture of your inner self -
    <br>the man himself, the real you.
    <br>But I have good news for you today.
    <br>When you realise that your heart is the fountain of all that you do,
    <br>then, you will see the need to allow Jesus to intervene on the inside of you.
    <br>Today, He wants to rebuild your life.
    <br>He wants to remove your tears.
    <br>He wants to show that there is something bigger than your problem.
    <br>Are you ready? Will you allow Him?
    <br>Change your focus.
    <br>Rebuilding you starts on the inside of you; it requires your attention.
    <br>By faith, listen to Jesus in the inner room.
    <br>By faith, listen to Him in the inner room telling you,
    <br>"Come to Me all you who are heavy laden and I will give you My rest".
    <br>When you step into the presence of Jesus, your thinking will change,
    <br>your attitude will change, everything about you will change.
    <br>You will no longer look at yourself in the natural; you will know what God says about you.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, keep focus.
    <br>Identify your source".
    <br>This leads me to our message today: FOCUS ON GOD.
    <br>Let someone say, "Focus on God".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, focus on God".
    <br>Say to yourself, "My heart - focus on God".
    <br>Let me take you to the book of Hebrews 12. Let me start from verse 1.
    <br>"Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,
    <br>let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us,
    <br>and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
    <br>looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,
    <br>who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross,
    <br>despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
    <br>Let someone say: A seat of power with power.
    <br>Focus on God.
    <br>You are what you give your attention to.
    <br>What you are looking at affects your thoughts.
    <br>A man's life is what his thoughts make it.
    <br>My life is what my thoughts make it.
    <br>Your behaviour and conduct cannot change until Jesus gives birth to a picture in you
    <br>of what He is looking at when He sees you.
    <br>When you focus on God today, you are indeed what God says you are
    <br>and you have what God says you have.
    <br>Daniel was a captive but he never referred to himself as a captive
    <br>because he steadfastly focused on his God and knew who he was.
    <br>That enabled him to have a mighty breakthrough and he became a biblical hero of faith.
    <br>Get connected.
    <br>No matter the trouble, get connected by faith.
    <br>When you discover what God has made you for, your life will change.
    <br>When you connect to God, when you focus on God,
    <br>then you will realise what God has made you for and how He cherishes your company.
    <br>Mankind is designed by God to think with God, plan with God, act with God and talk with God.
    <br>No state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God.
    <br>Are you living in tune with God?
    <br>Are you planning with Him? Are you acting with Him?
    <br>Acting on the Word of God builds faith in the heart of the believer
    <br>because faith focuses on Jesus.
    <br>Faith focuses on Jesus.
    <br>Look to the cross.
    <br>By looking at God, looking unto God, meditating on God, faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>Jesus Christ possesses a nature that makes us to believe in Him.
    <br>He possesses a nature that makes it easy to believe and trust in Him.
    <br>When you realise how reliable the Lord is, faith comes naturally.
    <br>Faith comes naturally.
    <br>Say with a smile, "Faith comes naturally".
    <br>The transforming promise Jesus Christ offers you and I today is liberation.
    <br>With this liberation, you will no longer be ruled by your situation.
    <br>You will no longer be ruled by your senses.
    <br>He is here today to deliver you from it.
    <br>He is here to offer you the kind of liberation...
    <br>The Bible says, if the Son of God sets you free, you are free indeed.
    <br>I am free indeed.
    <br>I refuse to look at my problem - I focus on Him.
    <br>Once you focus on Him, your life will never remain the same again.
    <br>You will know what we call the 'dividend of democracy'.
    <br>The dividend of living in tune with God.
    <br>What is it?
    <br>Once you make Jesus Christ of Nazareth your CEO, your Director,
    <br>you become one directed by the Heavenly Father.
    <br>You become a man or woman wired, connected to the Heavenly Father.
    <br>Then, you will know that there is nobody and there will be nobody quite like you.
    <br>You are unique.
    <br>There is nobody, there will be nobody quite like me.
    <br>Stop comparing yourself with others.
    <br>Once you realise that, you will have a sensitivity you never had before.
    <br>You will know God as children know their father.
    <br>You will know God's opinion about yourself and others.
    <br>You will have a relationship with God Almighty.
    <br>And the man of God says: A sense of fatherhood will produce a natural basis for prayer.
    <br>And he said: "The greatest achievement on earth is to pray as God wants us to pray".
    <br>The greatest achievement on earth is to pray as God wants you to pray.
    <br>When you do, you will want what God wants
    <br>and you will want it for the reason God wants it.
    <br>Whatever you ask shall be provided.
    <br>One is rewarded when he prays, laughs, looks and smiles in faith.
    <br>The Spirit of Father dwelling in your heart will enable you to cry out, "Abba Father!" naturally.
    <br>He will allow you to pray naturally, speak naturally.
    <br>When you pray in love and faith, God prays.
    <br>When you talk in love and faith, God talks.
    <br>Let someone say: "The dividend of democracy".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, focus on God".
    <br>If you focus on your problem, you lose focus on God.
    <br>Focus on God Almighty and not on the problem - no matter what comes, no matter what happens.
    <br>Look at what happened to the Israelites at the point of entering the promised land.
    <br>They focused on their giant.
    <br>Fear took hold of them
    <br>and fear increased the size of their giant, mentally.
    <br>They began to exalt their giant above God and they destroyed their confidence in God.
    <br>Whatever your situation is -
    <br>is it barrenness?
    <br>Is it poverty?
    <br>Is it family curse?
    <br>No matter what it is, focus on God.
    <br>Ask Hannah, she will tell you that a lack of absolute confidence in what they believe
    <br>is what causes people today to lose focus and balance
    <br>when the answer to their prayers seems to delay.
    <br>A lack of absolute trust in what they believe is what causes people to lose focus and balance
    <br>when the answer to their prayers seems to delay.
    <br>They begin to look for alternatives.
    <br>What kept Hannah from despairing was not what she saw but what she believed -
    <br>because she knew, she learnt the value of focusing on God.
    <br>The Scripture says that she was faced with
    <br>a seemingly overwhelming natural circumstance of barrenness for so many years
    <br>but she refused to give up to that voice of discouragement that was howling over her mind
    <br>because she was conscious of her faith.
    <br>She focused on God Almighty.
    <br>As you are sitting down, whatever giant that is troubling your heart -
    <br>Jesus is greater than all.
    <br>She ran to God's presence in prayer.
    <br>Prayer is not saying words.
    <br>She ran into God's presence and she prayed.
    <br>She was silent but her faith was not silent.
    <br>She poured out her heart before God
    <br>and the Bible says her heart was deeply engaged with God Almighty.
    <br>Immediately she heard the Word of faith, she believed
    <br>and the state of her mind was renewed instantly.
    <br>God's Word refreshes my mind; God's Spirit renews my strength.
    <br>Engage your heart as you are sitting down.
    <br>He is in our midst.
    <br>God Almighty is in the house through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>Jesus Christ listens to us when we pray
    <br>and He replies according to the state of our mind.
    <br>What is the state of your mind?
    <br>What is going through you right now?
    <br>She believed the Word and the Bible says,
    <br>immediately, she looked beyond her circumstance.
    <br>She looked beyond the state of barrenness and saw herself in a future state of fruitfulness.
    <br>as if it was already there, as if it was already true.
    <br>Her behaviour changed.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, prayer changes me; faith causes things to happen".
    <br>It will happen for you today.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A humble believing soul that truly loves Jesus Christ
    <br>takes everything Jesus says and does it in good faith
    <br>and puts the best construction on it.
    <br>When she heard and she believed, her behaviour changed.
    <br>Immediately, she removed the garment of sorrow and a smile enlightened her face
    <br>because she believed that her request for a child was granted by God
    <br>and indeed, Samuel, the great prophet and judge was born.
    <br>What is your giant?
    <br>What is the problem that brought you here today?
    <br>As you are seated, check your heart.
    <br>Whatever you are experiencing now that is contrary to your heart's desire - stop!
    <br>Stop thinking about your problem.
    <br>Take time to change your focus because you are in His presence.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, listen to my voice. If you run out of rope, grab onto faith".
    <br>Don't run from God; run to God
    <br>and that hope, that promise will become a reality.
    <br>Jesus said in John 8:12, "I am the light of the world.
    <br>He who follows Me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life".
    <br>The only way you can see life clearly is to focus on Jesus.
    <br>It is not your mere wishful thinking but your rightful focus on Him
    <br>that determines who you are before God.
    <br>It is not your mere wishful thinking but your rightful focus
    <br>that determines who you are before God.
    <br>Focus on God, not on the problem.
    <br>Focus on Him.
    <br>What you regard as failure is not failure at all from eternity's perspective.
    <br>That problem, that trouble is not failure from eternity's perspective.
    <br>You need to know what God says about the situation.
    <br>You need to know what God says about you.
    <br>It is within you - it is hidden.
    <br>You need to discover it.
    <br>There is something in you that is dormant - as was my case.
    <br>Today is the day that the Lord has made.
    <br>I will rejoice and be glad in it.
    <br>If you believe, you will rejoice.
    <br>Focus on God Almighty, not on the trouble.
    <br>Your focus determines your response to the situation
    <br>and that response determines your future.
    <br>Look to God.
    <br>Discover it.
    <br>How do you discover it?
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>As you are sitting down, that voice of condemnation, that voice of fear,
    <br>what people have been saying about you -
    <br>today, if you believe, you will get out of the wilderness.
    <br>Yielding your heart to the Word of God makes the Word of God a reality.
    <br>Yielding your heart to the Word of God makes the promise a reality
    <br>and when it does - the Bible says, you become Word-minded and God-minded.
    <br>When you are God-minded, you will know the mind of God about you and your situation.
    <br>The illumination of the Spirit of God will settle in your heart the truth from eternity's perspective.
    <br>The illumination of the Spirit of God will settle in my heart today the truth from eternity's perspective.
    <br>Look to Jesus.
    <br>Focusing on Jesus Christ of Nazareth puts everything else in its proper perspective.
    <br>Focusing on Him will put everything else in its proper perspective.
    <br>Are you barren?
    <br>Ask Hannah - you will see fruitfulness instead of barrenness.
    <br>You will see healing instead of sickness.
    <br>Are you poor?
    <br>Ask Jabez - you will see prosperity instead of setback.
    <br>Look to Jesus.
    <br>He has come to change your life.
    <br>He has changed my own; He will change your own if you believe.
    <br>King David, Daniel, Simon Peter, along with many heroes of faith -
    <br>they all struggled with various doubts in their lives
    <br>but they focused steadfastly on God Almighty and they prayed without ceasing.
    <br>They knew their enemy lost no time in plotting against them;
    <br>they lost no time in committing their lives to God Almighty.
    <br>The secret of a successful life is to learn to focus on God, not on the happenings around you.
    <br>Focus on Him.
    <br>No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, focus on God.
    <br>Engage your heart.
    <br>As you are sitting down, meditate on the Word of God and whatever you do will prosper.
    <br>Keep focus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Keep focus; identify your Source".
    <br>Who is your Source?
    <br>Jesus Christ of Nazareth who raised the dead will change your life.
    <br>When you look at Him, you will see your life clearly.
    <br>May God Bless His Word.
