    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday 10th July, 2016, during a Sunday Live Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message regarding an attack on Thursday.
    <br>These were his words...
    <br>Since morning, God keeps saying we should pray and fast on Thursday
    <br>and avert any attack in any nation.
    <br>On Thursday, this coming Thursday, pray and fast.
    <br>I said, which nation?
    <br>I can't say this is the nation - the attack they are talking about.
    <br>But every nation, just pray on Thursday -
    <br>an attack on any nation should be averted.
    <br>So, please, open your lips and pray, right now.
    <br>On Thursday.
