  <p>    
    <br>Last week, there was a strange thing that happened when I was praying for people.
    <br>I saw a gentleman who is not a Nigerian that was arrested.
    <br>During the deliverance, the confession was so...
    <br>What I saw on the placard was not what I was looking at.
    <br>A different thing was on the placard but the problem he has is a different thing.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the people at the prayer line in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and encounters this man from Holland.
    <br>Let's watch what happens.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>All you have written here - you have not said the truth about your problem.
    <br>You are from where?
    <br>I am from Holland.
    <br>You are from Holland. All these statements here - spirit of anger, spirit of smoking... -
    <br>you are not saying the truth.
    <br>What I am seeing on the placard is different from what I am seeing here.
    <br>You have the spirit of robbery.
    <br>This anger leads you to rob.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on! Stand up!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Stand right!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand right!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>I was into a criminal life - drugs and prostitution.
    <br>You had a gang that you could go out with to...
    <br>Yes, that is true.
    <br>I was among criminals who did drugs.
    <br>I used to steal since I was young and I did drugs.
    <br>I have been to prison.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Right. You want to do spite in the presence of God.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>He doesn't want to be delivered because he has pride.
    <br>You are delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Yes, I am free. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>I am Aren. I am an Armenian living in Holland.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Last Sunday, I was here in the church and the man of God T.B. Joshua told me:
    <br>He told me that what I had written on my placard was not the whole truth.
    <br>He told me that I had the spirit of stealing.
    <br>He also said that I used weapons.
    <br>What the man of God said is true.
    <br>Because in my past life, it was like that.
    <br>From an early age, I used to steal.
    <br>Between the ages of 19 and 20, I became involved with criminal activities.
    <br>I joined a big mafia system.
    <br>The mafia system I belonged to was from Russia. It was a Russian mafia.
    <br>There was also an Armenian mafia in Europe.
    <br>So, we were involved in a very big mafia system.
    <br>Don't worry. Tell me how you feel now.
    <br>Perfect.
    <br>Perfect. That spirit that was pushing you to rob, to steal -
    <br>are you still feeling this spirit in you?
    <br>I don't have the urge to steal, smoke or use drugs anymore.
    <br>Okay. What have you done to get out of this spirit of stealing and robbery in the past?
    <br>I visited different churches in Europe and also in Armenia
    <br>but that didn't help me. It did not help to get me delivered.
    <br>I wanted to be delivered but it was all to no avail.
    <br>I have been to many churches in Europe and also in Armenia, which is my country,
    <br>and tried to find a solution to get delivered but there was no way out.
    <br>I even went to Benny Hinn's crusade in Rotterdam, Holland.
    <br>When Benny Hinn came to Rotterdam in Holland, I went there with members of my church.
    <br>Nothing changed. I remained the same.
    <br>Okay. Why did you want to get out of this spirit?
    <br>I was totally and completely tired of the disgusting lifestyle I was living.
    <br>Clap for Jesus! Rise up!
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah. Did you listen to that?
    <br>He said he was tired.
    <br>He wanted to get out of it. He didn't want to do that again.
    <br>But how did you come across The SCOAN, T.B. Joshua, all the way from Holland?
    <br>How did you come across this church?
    <br>There was one time I was watching the miracles of Jesus Christ on YouTube.
    <br>I saw T.B. Joshua from Nigeria.
    <br>I saw all the wonders that are happening here.
    <br>And I told myself...
    <br>I told a friend of mine who is like a brother from Congo,
    <br>"Jean Pierre, my dear brother, I am totally tired of this life".
    <br>I told him, "I am going to Nigeria with you".
    <br>I told him, "I believe that as soon as I am in Nigeria, I will be totally free, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Aren
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Sometimes when you see some of your young ones carrying a gun and robbing,
    <br>killing people, you think that they derive joy in doing it.
    <br>You never knew that they are under bondage.
    <br>There are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>There are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage.
    <br>Again.
    <br>There are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage.
    <br>It is not easy. A normal person would not carry a gun and start killing and stealing,
    <br>unless you are under a force, a power.
    <br>If you are not under that power, you cannot bow down for that kind of...
    <br>There are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage -
    <br>bondage of stealing, killing, destruction.
    <br>It is not something one can just wake up in the morning and say, "I need money".
    <br>This is why sometimes when I hear the noise all over the world that
    <br>because you are poor, that is why you are stealing,
    <br>you have no father and mother, that is why you are stealing,
    <br>they are frustrated, that is why they carry guns, kill people and destroy people -
    <br>I laugh.
    <br>There is poverty everywhere.
    <br>You can't because of poverty carry a gun.
    <br>You can't because of hardship carry a gun.
    <br>You can't because you have no father and mother carry a gun.
    <br>You can't because you are an orphan carry a gun.
    <br>You can only carry a gun and kill people when you are under the power of an evil spirit.
    <br>Actually, it was so in my life that we, the whole mafia group, were all over Europe.
    <br>How do you sleep now?
    <br>I sleep very well and peacefully like a baby.
    <br>Two days ago, at night in my dream, I heard a very weird sound.
    <br>That was two days ago?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>After the deliverance?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Listen to that. He said that after the deliverance, he had a similar dream.
    <br>Okay, let's listen.
    <br>Aren
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The sounds I heard were like that of people making love.
    <br>I went to the room and I saw those dirty things and I found them disgusting.
    <br>Immediately, I withdrew from that place.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>This is to tell you that there is a force.
    <br>You cannot separate your loved ones by cane, by putting them in prison,
    <br>by killing them.
    <br>If you kill them, that spirit will go out and it is the flesh you are killing.
    <br>This is why the killing cannot stop robbery - it will be increasing
    <br>because the spirit in them will get out of them and enter another person and start the job.
    <br>But when you deliver them, you put them into a lock perpetually.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So, what message do you have for the young ones all over the world?
    <br>I am going to share with you a little part of my story.
    <br>We went in a group to Europe - France, Germany, Belgium and Holland.
    <br>We would destroy shops and gas stations.
    <br>We would also destroy cars and steal them.
    <br>Long ago, there was a former notorious mafia man who was very well known
    <br>in Europe, Russia and Armenia.
    <br>I was given this by an ex-mafia man - our leader.
    <br>Aren
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So, you were given this ring by whom?
    <br>A former notorious mafia man who is now a minister of God. He is a brother in Christ.
    <br>This assisted you to rob, to do all sorts of things.
    <br>He gave me this ring in church and told me that it was from God.
    <br>I did not know what that meant.
    <br>I got this from our leader - it is a covenant.
    <br>Now, you are free. That is why you hand over the ring to me.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>So you are my friend.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>Now, the covenant has been transferred.
    <br>You have a covenant with Jesus now.
    <br>So, you cannot have this ring.
    <br>How many years ago did you receive this ring?
    <br>Two to three years ago.
    <br>So, this ring - even if you hold it, you can feel some evil spirit power.
    <br>It is a talisman.
    <br>That when you have it, you will continue the job.
    <br>Nobody can get you; nobody can arrest you.
    <br>Where people cannot go, you go to and come out.
    <br>Thank you. Give advice to the whole world.
    <br>I am giving advice to the young and old who are involved in criminal activities
    <br>that this is not something you should be doing.
    <br>Don't get involved with criminals.
    <br>Do not steal.
    <br>Do not watch pornography.
    <br>Follow Jesus for the rest of your life.
    <br>Tell him that he is my friend.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The devil is a liar! I am free, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Agedu Bangawa. I am from Congo.
    <br>I am a friend of Aren.
    <br>The change I have seen in the life of Aren is very big.
    <br>During his stay here, previously, when he slept at night, I would hear him shout
    <br>because his bed was near to mine.
    <br>Now, I don't hear anything.
    <br>He sleeps like a baby.
    <br>Before, he told me, "Jean-Pierre,..."
    <br>With this ring, he can be on the bed and is somewhere.
    <br>So all these (shouts) are not there
    <br>because the spirit that worked with the ring is gone.
    <br>That is it. We want to thank you for leading him.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
