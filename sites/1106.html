    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Good Morning.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I was looking at what you were seeing; the joy is so overwhelming.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know some people here don't know how to dance, but the way they were dancing;
    <br>I was, "Oh, my God!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Spirit of God can inspire one to begin to...
    <br>Are you still in that mood?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Please, help me hold it...
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The free spirit to fellowship – I think this is what is happening now.
    <br>The free spirit to fellowship – spirit that has nothing against his neighbour,
    <br>nothing against anyone.
    <br>Your situation, you leave it for God; don’t worry yourself.
    <br>You just see yourself the way you were created.
    <br>You are what God says you are.
    <br>You have what God says you have.
    <br>You can do what God says you can do.
    <br>That is a free spirit.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are with us and we are with you.
    <br>Bless you!
    <br>Like I have said, you need a free spirit.
    <br>Jesus cannot share with a heart that is full of unforgiveness.
    <br>- Are you with me?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>He cannot share with a heart that is full of bitterness, envy, jealousy.
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot share with such a heart so you need a free spirit.
    <br>It is this free spirit that craves for the Word of God, for Jesus Himself.
    <br>To hearts that are holding offence – be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>To hearts that are full of unforgiveness – check your heart.
    <br>To hearts that are full of unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred,
    <br>envy, jealousy, still holding the pain of the past -
    <br>be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Do you know I am talking to your heart?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>No no no, you don't know.
    <br>Do you know I am talking to your heart?
    <br>Let your heart answer me.
    <br>Do you know I am talking to your heart?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I say, “Be free, in the name of Jesus!”
    <br>Amen!
    <br>To hearts that are full of unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred, jealousy, envy, anger -
    <br>be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, check yourselves.
    <br>If you are still holding grudges against anyone, you have already offended the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Holding grudges, bitterness, envy, jealousy, against anyone -
    <br>you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Because we would not be able to move forward;
    <br>I would not be able to carry you along – hearts that are full of offence, full of envy, jealousy.
    <br>You would just be seeing what is happening but to be part of what is happening is impossible
    <br>because of offence, because of envy,
    <br>because of jealousy, because of bitterness.
    <br>Check your heart.
    <br>Say, “My heart, be free!
    <br>My heart, crave for God; crave for the Word of God!"
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>My heart, be free!
    <br>My heart!
    <br>Our heart is the contact point, the place of point for Jesus.
    <br>If Jesus is coming to you, it is not your eyes, it is not your mouth, it is not your appearance -
    <br>it is your heart.
    <br>My heart, crave for the Word of God!
    <br>My heart, yearn for the Word of God!
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Sometimes we can be dancing, be happy, just emotional - feeling.
    <br>Happiness can be found around, just in what is happening.
    <br>Just get it around, and after leaving that place, it is over.
    <br>My heart!
    <br>I want to carry you along; this is why we are talking to your real self – your heart.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Are you there with me?
    <br>I am not saying this body.
    <br>I know you are on the seat; I know you are looking at me.
    <br>You can be looking at me, sitting down, whereas you are not here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>If your heart is not at its best, don’t be surprised if the Bible is no more real to you -
    <br>the Bible you carry is no more real, is a literature, is history.
    <br>If your heart is not at its best, the Bible you carry becomes a history book, not Bible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “If my heart is not at its best, the Bible you carry automatically becomes history,
    <br>a history book just about apostles, stories about apostles, just history, literature.
    <br>It is no longer Bible if your heart is not at its best.
    <br>That is why we have not been seeing the reflection of the Bible in your life.
    <br>People see you carrying the Bible -
    <br>no, it is literature, a mere history book you are carrying because your heart is not at its best.
    <br>Your heart must be at its best.
    <br>Sometimes, if your heart is not at its best, you can even drop it and talk to yourself -
    <br>get yourself together.
    <br>If my heart is not at its best, I would not come here; I would not be here.
    <br>I would not have contact with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It is when our heart is at its best, there is contact.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>These are the things you need to do before prayer.
    <br>Are you at your best before prayer, before, “In Jesus’ name”?
    <br>Your heart must be at its best before you begin to pray.
    <br>You don’t just stand up and say, “Let us pray”.
    <br>As you are watching the virtues, the healing power,
    <br>take this song, continue to sing this song:
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Each time you see that healing happen, it is the presence of God -
    <br>through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>“Jesus” – you see people getting healed; it means Jesus is there.
    <br>Quickly invite Him to your heart; let Him take more of you.
    <br>You have been praying; now, you are seeing it coming.
    <br>You can see, "That is Jesus".
    <br>Quickly invite Him to your heart; get Him in your heart.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
