    <br>NIGERIAN IMMIGRATION STAMPEDE VICTIM’S MIRACULOUS RECOVERY
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Here is Prophet TB Joshua ministering prayer in The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line
    <br>in the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Remember, it is God's power.
    <br>Let's see what happens.
    <br>Man of God, please help me!
    <br>I was in a stampede.
    <br>Man of God, please help me!
    <br>I cannot walk. I have a swollen leg.
    <br>I am booked for an operation tomorrow.
    <br>I went to write Nigerian Immigration Exams in the National Stadium, Abuja.
    <br>I was among the victims of the stampede, sir.
    <br>Man of God, help me. I cannot walk.
    <br>I cannot turn my neck. My legs are swollen.
    <br>I am booked for an operation tomorrow in Abuja!
    <br>So, you are one of the people ...
    <br>- Yes
    <br>- that went for the ...
    <br>- Nigerian Immigration Exam to look for a job.
    <br>So many people died.
    <br>You should not, because of what happened to you when you were looking for a job,
    <br>disregard the nation Nigeria.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Anywhere you stand, anywhere you are, you should defend your nation.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>- Ok?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Honour the nation and disregard the people.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Ok?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- The nation is bigger than anyone.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>It is not the nation that caused what happened to you.
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>- Ok.
    <br>If Nigeria caused this and Nigeria rescued you, what else again?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>- Ok.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>Knowing that at that precious name,
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua continues to pray
    <br>as the Holy Spirit is busy perfecting the healing
    <br>in the life of Miss Attaidu.
    <br>Truly her case has not escaped the anointing of God that breaks every yoke.
    <br>Don't run; just walk gently.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>Mercy rises up and begins to walk freely without using the walking frame, the lumbar corset or a neck collar.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Indeed, what a God we have to worship, what a Son we have to praise, what a future lies before us.
    <br>It is clear to see the extent of the spinal cord injury by the terrible incident.
    <br>Even the bone has come out here.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>The bone here is the one that shoots out here.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Can you see the bone?
    <br>- You are booked for an operation?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Ok.
    <br>- Tomorrow.
    <br>- The bone will go back.
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>So it means the bone that is supposed to be like this, came out like that.
    <br>That is dislocation.
    <br>The operation is to force it back and tighten it,
    <br>but you will go through God's operation.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua continues his prayer,
    <br>prophetically declaring that the shifted bone would return to its place,
    <br>and she would not have to undergo the operation
    <br>that the doctors had already booked for her the following day, on Monday.
    <br>She has been declared free, in Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>There are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus Christ!".
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mercy Attaidu.
    <br>I am from Kogi State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was difficulty in walking.
    <br>On 15th March I was called for an interview
    <br>for the Nigerian Immigration Exam at the National Stadium in Abuja.
    <br>On getting there, I met a large crowd.
    <br>I tried to go back, but my mind told me that I should just wait.
    <br>As more and more people came, I decided to go back,
    <br>but there was no way I could turn back anymore.
    <br>When it was becoming too much, within 10 minutes,
    <br>I was pushed down by the crowd and people were stepping on me.
    <br>It wasn't until everybody had entered the stadium
    <br>that they realised that we were on the ground
    <br>and they took us to hospital.
    <br>I was unconscious and on oxygen for one week.
    <br>It was a week later that I knew I was in the hospital.
    <br>While I was in hospital, I went through so much pain, such that I can't explain.
    <br>For three weeks I couldn't eat or drink anything.
    <br>I was on a drip throughout that time because I had an internal injury.
    <br>They ran so many tests
    <br>and it was discovered that I had a spinal cord injury and a neck fracture.
    <br>The problem affected my life.
    <br>In April, I was booked for an operation.
    <br>While I was in the hospital I wore a neck collar  because I was not able to move my neck.
    <br>I had a stiff neck due to the neck fracture.
    <br>I used a lumbar corset and a walking frame to help me walk.
    <br>I could not do anything on my own without those things.
    <br>At the prayer line two Sundays ago, the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Immediately when he prayed for me, the pain just ceased.
    <br>With the pain I was having,
    <br>before I could sit down, I would have to hold onto something very well.
    <br>The pain ceased immediately.
    <br>I don't even know how to explain the way it happened.
    <br>I felt relieved, immediately.
    <br>Miss Mercy Attaidu
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I can walk; I can even run now!
    <br>I can bend down,
    <br>I can turn my neck,
    <br>I can jump and
    <br>do everything that I could not do before.
    <br>Miss Mercy Attaidu
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>Bouncing with energy and joy, Mercy runs - now healed.
    <br>That is the evidence of Jesus Christ -  lives transformed from sickness to good health
    <br>NIGERIAN IMMIGRATION STAMPEDE VICTIM’S MIRACULOUS RECOVERY
    <br>I will follow Jesus for the rest of my life.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank the man of God
    <br>for what he has been doing in my life.
    <br>Since I have been here, I have not paid for anything.
    <br>The hospitality, the care and love,
    <br>and even the financial assistance rendered to me
    <br>during my stay here - I am comfortable.
    <br>I just want to thank the man of God for what he has done in my life.
    <br>I love Nigeria; I love the man of God.
    <br>NIGERIAN IMMIGRATION STAMPEDE VICTIM’S MIRACULOUS RECOVERY
    <br>Mercy continues to move her neck from the left to the right demonstrating her perfect healing.
    <br>She further exercises herself, moving in ways she was unable to before due to the fractured neck and back injury.
    <br>But now, both the neck collar and lumbar corset she once depended on have been removed, as she is healed.
    <br>Here we see the stark difference to the condition she first came with.
    <br>NIGERIAN IMMIGRATION STAMPEDE VICTIM’S MIRACULOUS RECOVERY
    <br>No more pain again; I am not feeling pain again.
    <br>Miss Mercy Attaidu
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>My advice to the viewers all over the world is to put your trust in God.
    <br>With God all things are possible.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Miss Mercy Attaidu
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>In addition to the healing Mercy received,
    <br>TB Joshua and The Emmanuel TV Partners further support Mercy with a gift of N200,000 to support her financially
    <br>and a faith-building book to support her spiritually.
    <br>The man of God helped me with N200,000 cash gift, with a copy of "The Mirror".
    <br>I thank God for what the man of God did in my life,
    <br>for bringing me back to someone again,
    <br>for making me to be who I am today.
    <br>I want to thank God for his life;
    <br>God will increase him more and more, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I thank God for my healing also.
