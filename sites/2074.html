    <br>During the Monday Live Service at The SCOAN
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua prays for the international visitors, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Among those who received a healing touch from our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>was this man who had suffered from deafness for five years.
    <br>After the Monday Service where the man of God prayed for this man
    <br>who was one of the international visitors to The SCOAN,
    <br>one of his roommates came to call the camera crew
    <br>to listen to his wonderful testimony.
    <br>The camera crew rush up the stairs to this man's room
    <br>and as the doors are opened
    <br>they are welcomed by the excited roommates
    <br>who share in this man's joy at his healing.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>I'm totally delivered! I am healed! I'm saved!
    <br>My name is John Marufu.
    <br>I am a Zimbabwean, but I am residing in Botswana.
    <br>Five years ago I went to hospital - one of the biggest hospitals in Botswana where I am staying.
    <br>I had deafness of the left ear; it was totally closed.
    <br>I had lost hope. It affected my life and I was going through depression. I did not understand myself.
    <br>I said to myself, "How can I, as young as I am, be going deaf?".
    <br>For example, if you are in an interview and you keep saying, "Huh?".
    <br>The person will end up losing confidence in you.
    <br>Even if you go for business meetings, people will end up losing confidence in you
    <br>if you keep on asking them the same thing.
    <br>I was saying to myself that after the service, I would visit the doctor for ear cleaning.
    <br>I had lost hope completely.
    <br>I came here to The SCOAN and the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>From there, we went to the dining room and then to our room.
    <br>I went to my bed to relax and I tried to sleep, but I could not.
    <br>I was feeling so hot.
    <br>All of a sudden, my left ear started itching; it was so hot inside.
    <br>So, I woke up and went to the dining room to fetch cold water to cool myself down because I was so hot.
    <br>I tried to sleep, but I could not.
    <br>I took my ear bud and started to clean the ear and then something came out.
    <br>All of a sudden I heard a 'shhhh' sound. Then I started hearing!
    <br>I closed my right ear and found that I could hear.
    <br>My name is Kudakwashe Nzvengende from Zimbabwe, but I currently reside in Botswana.
    <br>I want to confirm the healing of John Marufu.
    <br>In 2008, I came to Botswana and joined a company where he was working.
    <br>After six months working together, John Marufu was given three weeks off
    <br>because of his deafness.
    <br>The Managing Director almost wanted to fire him because he was always ill or off work
    <br>because of the problem of deafness.
    <br>So, I am happy that he can now hear with both ears.
    <br>My name is Dr David Maruma. I am from Botswana.
    <br>I am one of the people who witnessed a miracle when Mr Marufu was healed.
    <br>I heard him shout that he had been healed of deafness of the left ear.
    <br>I came in and listened to what he was saying and started praising God.
    <br>Deafness may be due to many things; it could be trauma or an infection.
    <br>Whatever was the cause, we are happy that he has been healed.
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Let me start by introducing myself.
    <br>My name is John Marufu.
    <br>I am a Zimbabwean, but I am staying in Botswana.
    <br>I have been suffering from deafness from an ear problem for five years.
    <br>I couldn't hear in my left ear.
    <br>So, during a Monday service, the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>After praying for me, I went down.
    <br>He just touched me and I went down.
    <br>Then I stood up and the ushers told me to go back to the dining room or to my room.
    <br>It is done; it is okay.
    <br>But I started fighting with them saying, "Do you think I came all this way to go and eat at the dining room?".
    <br>"No, I am not going. I want to see the man of God!".
    <br>This unbelieving spirit was upon me.
    <br>I was not satisfied with just a touch.
    <br>After most of the people had been prayed for, I forced myself to go out.
    <br>I went to the dining room. Then, later to my room.
    <br>When I got to the room, I tried to sleep but I felt heat all over my body. It felt like fire.
    <br>Then my left ear started to itch and became hot inside.
    <br>I climbed off my bed and went back to the dining room to drink some water in an attempt to recover.
    <br>I went back to the room and I could still not sleep.
    <br>So, I tried to read my Bible, but I failed because the heat inside my ear was too much for me;
    <br>the fire was too much on this ear.
    <br>So, I took my ear bud and began cleaning my left ear.
    <br>I used a second earbud and started cleaning it.
    <br>Then all of a sudden, I just heard 'shhhh'. Then, I was healed!
    <br>I blocked my right ear to prove it to myself.
    <br>I heard the men talking in my room.
    <br>I woke my roommate who was next to me and said to him,
    <br>"My brother, mine is done. I am totally healed. I am delivered. I can hear!"
    <br>"I suffered with this problem for over five years, but now I am healed!".
    <br>I told him that I had booked an appointment with my doctor upon my return from Nigeria to have my ears cleaned.
    <br>But now I can hear perfectly. I am okay.
    <br>I want to thank God!
    <br>God touched my ear, which was not the problem why I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>DEAF-DEFYING MIRACLE!!!
    <br>I want to thank God!
    <br>Children of God, imagine because of this deafness I almost got fired from my job,
    <br>and at times I lost big tenders because people did not take me seriously
    <br>when I kept having to ask, "Hey, hey, pardon?".
    <br>People did not take me seriously.
    <br>Imagine going into a business meeting with senior people and you are trying to get a big tender
    <br>and you keep saying, "Huh?".
    <br>They won't believe in you.
    <br>They will say, "No, this man is trying to play with us".
    <br>So, I want to thank God. God has highly favoured me!
    <br>My advice is that when the man of God says that it is done, it will surely be done.
    <br>There is no two ways about it.
    <br>When he prayed for me, it was totally done, despite my unbelieving heart.
    <br>And I received it.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Wow. Viewers all over the world, listen to that.
