    <br>Free spirit - that is, a heart without unforgiveness, anger, bitterness,
    <br>pain of the past, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Heart without unforgiveness, bitterness, anger, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>That is where your problem is.
    <br>Free spirit.
    <br>Spirit means heart.
    <br>Heart without unforgiveness.
    <br>Heart without bitterness.
    <br>Heart without envy.
    <br>Heart without bad feelings towards others.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong.
    <br>Bad feelings - whether the person wronged you or not.
    <br>Heart without bad feelings towards others.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>Everything about you suggests unforgiveness.
    <br>Your political party - Republican, Democrat, APC, ADP - they are holding offence against themselves.
    <br>Your business partner - offence against others.
    <br>Country to country - offence against others.
    <br>This is why, any step you take, you are taking it into darkness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Any step we take, we are taking it into darkness
    <br>because everything about us suggests unforgiveness".
    <br>That you are rich now does not mean you are rich until the end.
    <br>That you are superior now does not mean you are superior until the end.
    <br>The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>Since you were born, can you point to me someone in your family who started it and ended it?
    <br>Started big and ended big.
    <br>Everyone is fading away.
    <br>What is the cause? Offence, unforgiveness, bitterness, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>Anyone who cannot forgive is hurting himself more than anyone.
    <br>Holding grudges, holding bitterness damages hearts.
    <br>Holding unforgiveness damages hearts.
    <br>Any step you take, you are taking it into darkness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Holding unforgiveness, holding bad feelings towards others damages our spirits".
    <br>The Spirit of God expresses Himself through our spirit.
    <br>There is nowhere He can express Himself because you have damaged your heart.
