    <br>You will become God's servant.
    <br>Let it continue running. Don't stop.
    <br>A break in prayer is a break in faith and a break in faith is a break with the Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I am waiting for you to say this for 2-3 minutes
    <br>so that in the presence of God here, this can be registered in your heart.
    <br>It will become your habit non-stop.
