    <br>This is one of the centres in Africa
    <br>where THE NEW ANOINTING WATER has been taken to -
    <br>for South Africa, Ghana and other places in Africa.
    <br>Let us watch what happened
    <br>when they merely touched the container
    <br>without even opening the bottle
    <br>of the New Anointing Water to minister it.
    <br>Stay blessed.
