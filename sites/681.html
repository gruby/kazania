    <br>This is the newcomer service where people from other states of Nigeria and various different countries
    <br>who attended the Sunday service for the first time came back to meet with the man of God.
    <br>You unclean spirit!
    <br>Say, listen!
    <br>My body is not your temple.
    <br>I command you out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>There are almost 7 people that just came out now.
    <br>There is a pastor among them.
    <br>And I want him to be sincere; he is on the floor now.
    <br>Why is he on the floor with a collar?
    <br>We are not here to make a mockery.
    <br>You are not a pastor but you call yourself a pastor.
    <br>You use evil power.
    <br>During the time of prayer, the man of God gave a prophecy
    <br>that there was a man on the floor wearing a collar.
    <br>Although he called himself a pastor, he was not and that he was using evil powers.
    <br>Let's listen to the man.
    <br>I am Pastor Victory Chiaka from Divine Miracle Assembly in Imo State.
    <br>I have a problem in my ministry.
    <br>When the ministry is growing, it will grow backwards.
    <br>So, one man told me that he is the one who is troubling me.
    <br>Then I ran to my friend who took me to a witch doctor.
    <br>The witch doctor told me that he would prepare a charm for me
    <br>and that I will swallow.
    <br>He said that with these charms, no one would be able to kill me.
    <br>Concerning my ministry, he promised that those branches that had failed, would rise again.
    <br>What did you ask the witch doctor to do for you?
    <br>I asked the witch doctor to do a charm for my protection
    <br>and for my church to grow and have a large crowd.
    <br>Man of God, please deliver me.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Pastor Victory Chiaka from Divine Miracle Assembly in Imo State.
    <br>When my ministry was growing, all of a sudden, people started to threaten the ministry.
    <br>As they were threatening me, the church started to fold up.
    <br>I complained to one of my fellow pastors about the threats.
    <br>My fellow pastor said that there was a place he would take me to if I accepted.
    <br>I accepted and he took me to a witch doctor.
    <br>The witchdoctor told what to do after which he performed a charm.
    <br>After that he gave me something to put in the water.
    <br>He told me that we were going to buy a fowl and a goat for a sacrifice.
    <br>He said that when I had bought the fowl and goat and done the sacrifice,
    <br>the church would start to grow and people would not be able to kill me.
    <br>He also said that I would have the power to do miracles.
    <br>I brought the money to him and he did the sacrifice. 
    <br>After that he gave me a charm to put in the water.
    <br>I put it in the water and sprinkled it in the church premises
    <br>Then, many people started to come to the church.
    <br>If people were sick, I would give them the water to drink and in under 3 days they would recover.
    <br>As this continued happening, at a time the church started to go backwards again.
    <br>I went back to the witch doctor to tell him that the church was going backwards again.
    <br>Then I went to another witch doctor who said that he would help the church to grow.
    <br>He performed the charm and then killed a fowl and put the tongue of the fowl
    <br>on an idol there and mixed it with something and said that I should swallow it
    <br>so that I would have power and would be protected
    <br>and whatsoever I said would happen.
    <br>So I swallowed it and when I went back, whatever I said started to happen
    <br>and the ministry started to function very well.
    <br>I started to have a lot of branches.
    <br>But it started to go backwards again so I went to a third native doctor.
    <br>I told him that my church was not functioning very well.
    <br>He prepared some soap and I started to use it.
    <br>Then I went to my village and there they were watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I began watching it as well.
    <br>I returned to my house and continued watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When the man of God was praying for the viewers all over the world,
    <br>he asked them to touch the screen.
    <br>I touched the screen and felt like I received an electric shock.
    <br>When I went to bathe that night, I looked for the soap but I could not find it.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>The soap that I received from the witch doctor disappeared.
    <br>In the morning, I went back to the witch doctor and told him that I was unable to find the soap.
    <br>He said that there was a television station that I was watching whilst they were praying
    <br>and asked me why I had to watch that television station (Emmanuel TV).
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>When he said that it was my watching that television station that made the soap disappear
    <br>and come back to his shrine, I decided that I should come down to The SCOAN and see.
    <br>But the witch doctor warned me not to go.
    <br>He said that I should not go or even watch that station again,
    <br>that would not give me any power.
    <br>I said, "But your soap disappeared".
    <br>He said that it was forbidden to watch that television station.
    <br>When I had decided in my mind to come, evil spirits started to fight me in the dream
    <br>and shot me in the back - my back swelled up and water started coming out.
    <br>I went to many native doctors but they were unable to heal it.
    <br>As I continued to use the soap, although miracles were happening, the sickness was there.
    <br>When the soap disappeared, I decided that I must come to The SCOAN for prayer and healing.
    <br>This was my main purpose of coming.
    <br>After Sunday service, I came back on Monday.
    <br>During the prayer, I felt a lot of things started coming out of my back and I fell on the floor.
    <br>It felt like I saw an angel who flashed light at me
    <br> and the next thing was that I found myself by the altar.
    <br>Man of God, I plead with you to deliver me and pray for me to have the anointing of God
    <br>so that I will be able to pray; I don't want to go back to native doctors.
    <br>After the prayer that Monday, the power of God brought me out.
    <br>Then the native doctor called me and asked me where I was.
    <br>I told him that I had travelled.
    <br>He said that I had gone to the place that he had instructed me not to go to.
    <br>So help me, Man of God.
    <br>We believe that you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
