  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN prayer line - the arena of liberty,
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua is being used as an instrument of healing, deliverance
    <br>and all of God's blessings.
    <br>People from different countries all over the globe fall under the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and freedom comes to every area of their life, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As he prayed for the people, he encountered this lady
    <br>and the evil spirit that controlled her life and actions was exposed.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Stand right!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am from the water.
    <br>She doesn’t belong to anybody.
    <br>She is precious to the kingdom.
    <br>You have the spirit of woman.
    <br>My master sent me to her to destroy her.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I couldn't kill her because I love her.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>I'm a spirit woman.
    <br>She belongs to me.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I made her to love women only.
    <br>She is precious and I love her; she is not going to go.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am her wife.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>The evil spirit confessed all its destructive acts in the life of this woman,
    <br>and it is finally loosed from her, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>To God be the glory - she is free, and she rises to her feet; a new creation in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Genevieve Anyama, I’m from Imo State; I'm a Nigerian.
    <br>I studied in India and the person beside me is my sister.
    <br>We both reside in India.
    <br>I had the spirit of woman as the prophet had said which was true.
    <br>When I was a child, at the age of nine, I had a dream where I found myself in the water
    <br>and they crowned me as a king and presented a woman to me to marry as my queen.
    <br>When I woke up, I wondered what was going on because I could not understand the dream.
    <br>At that age, I just ignored it.
    <br>After some time, I changed and abandoned all the male friends that I had.
    <br>I didn’t like them anymore and started having more female friends.
    <br>I felt so comfortable with them.
    <br>I didn’t desire men because I felt like I was already a man; so, why would I have male friends?
    <br>That was how that spirit entered into me and started manifesting in me
    <br>and I started having that feeling – feelings for my fellow girls.
    <br>Can you tell us once again; what was the spirit that was in you then?
    <br>I had the spirit of woman.
    <br>How did this spirit of woman affect you, and what did it push you to do?
    <br>The feeling was getting stronger
    <br>and it pushed me to the extent that I became more attracted to them.
    <br>I was kind of scared and I was going along with that.
    <br>The thing was affecting me so badly that I didn't know myself totally,
    <br>and didn’t know what was happening to me.
    <br>I saw myself as a man but when I looked into the mirror, I was a girl.
    <br>I thought to myself what is happening to me because I am a lady, a girl,
    <br>but I behaved like a man.
    <br>I wore boys’ clothes and behaved like a boy.
    <br>That was how I grew up.
    <br>My education was nothing to write home about because my grades were so poor.
    <br>I was not concentrating and my health was down as well.
    <br>It affected my health, education and way of living.
    <br>When I was in India, I went to a private university where I studied nursing.
    <br>When I was in India, the feeling was so strong that it affected my subjects
    <br>and I could not concentrate on my course anymore.
    <br>Through the internet, I felt free to communicate with fellow girls like me who had that same spirit.
    <br>How did you get them on the internet - can you explain to us?
    <br>It was my hobby.
    <br>I liked browsing and searching different sites.
    <br>When it came to dating, I only focused on females.
    <br>It was a chatting app or sites for lesbians.
    <br>That was where I logged in and I could chat freely with those people.
    <br>I registered and started communicating there.
    <br>I didn’t communicate through my campus or school.
    <br>Can you tell us how far you went in your association with these friends you found on internet?
    <br>Through the site, I met people who lived near me in the country where I was staying.
    <br>I happened to like one of them and we would go out on dates.
    <br>From there, we started enjoying a relationship.
    <br>How far did you go in the relationship with this lady you found on the internet?
    <br>We went deeper like a normal relationship.
    <br>We became intimate and we even shared naked pictures and love messages.
    <br>Can you tell us what level you were in school?
    <br>It was in my third year.
    <br>In which school?
    <br>I was in my third year of university, studying nursing.
    <br>And you told us earlier that it affected your grades.
    <br>Can you just explain further how your grades were affected?
    <br>What were your grades at school?
    <br>It affected my grades – they were beyond poor.
    <br>They were below average.
    <br>If I read, I would not understand and I would forget.
    <br>I couldn’t focus on my studies and it affected me so much in my grades; I even had carryovers.
    <br>It also affected my practicals and everything.
    <br>How did you finally get delivered of this evil spirit - the spirit of woman?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I thank God for my parents.
    <br>My mum really loves God so much.
    <br>Whenever she watched Emmanuel TV and prayed along,
    <br>she would ask us to pray since we had access to the internet.
    <br>We could go to the site and pray along with Emmanuel TV
    <br>because our grades and health were poor.
    <br>So, we watched Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Anytime she asked us to read our Bible and pray, we would just ignore her.
    <br>We would agree to do it but ignore her advice and end up not doing it.
    <br>It affected her as well, especially her health.
    <br>Since I was the first one, I was supposed to control her.
    <br>I was living my own life and didn’t care.
    <br>So, she met bad friends and lived a wayward life – partying, drinking and all of that.
    <br>So, any time your mum called you, your response would give her a hint that something was amiss.
    <br>Yeah.
    <br>What then happened afterwards?
    <br>Whenever she called, I tried to cover up but she would still know being a mother.
    <br>She would call to ask if I prayed and read my Bible and I would respond that we had done so.
    <br>I would tell my mother that I was taking care of my sister
    <br>but she would know that things were not good because our grades were poor.
    <br>Each time our results came out, we would inform our parents and they saw that it was not working out
    <br>and told us we need to come to Nigeria for summer break
    <br>to work things out and come for deliverance and healing.
    <br>Whenever she mentioned that we should come down to Nigeria,
    <br>we would always make excuses.
    <br>She would trick us that we were coming down to Nigeria for a summer vacation.
    <br>We did not know that we were coming down here;
    <br>we thought we were coming for vacation because it was Lagos
    <br>where we would have fun with our family.
    <br>When we came here, we did not know that it was the building of The SCOAN.
    <br>When we came here, we thought the building was nice, like a place for tourists.
    <br>We then remembered that we had seen this place online and on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We realised that this was where our parents wanted us to come.
    <br>We didn’t want to come here; we were tricked into coming.
    <br>So, at the end of the day you found yourself at the prayer-line section that Sunday.
    <br>Tell us what happened.
    <br>When I was at the prayer section, I did not believe because I was not a spiritual person.
    <br>I thought that it was fun and like a drama but I just accepted it believing I would get what I wanted.
    <br>As the man of God was moving to where I was, people were just falling.
    <br>I thought, “What is going on. This is more than just fun”.
    <br>I did not find it fun anymore because people were falling.
    <br>When the man of God came near me, I was feeling uncomfortable and a lot of heat.
    <br>I was not feeling my usual self.
    <br>I only remembered when the man of God touched me and when I got off the ground.
    <br>I stood up from the ground and wondered what had happened.
    <br>- And that was how you received your deliverance?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>How many of you went to the prayer-line that day?
    <br>Me and my sister.
    <br>- So, the two of you were delivered that day?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Since that day you received that divine touch, through His anointed one - Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>as you were just watching on the screen of your TV...
    <br>We can see when she was at the prayer-line section,
    <br>and after that touch from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the evil spirit was manifesting, and at the end of the day she was delivered,
    <br>removed from that kingdom of darkness, from the captivity of satan and placed into the kingdom of light.
    <br>We give God all the glory.
    <br>Tell us the changes you have seen in yourself, since you received your deliverance.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>After my deliverance, I became my normal self again.
    <br>When I saw what had happened, I realised that this was the cause of my problem.
    <br>God took away the ‘poor and lame’ brain and put a brighter and smarter brain inside of me.
    <br>Whenever I read, it is like a magnet, it just stays there.
    <br>My grades were picking up and I was not even reading much.
    <br>Before, I needed to read for about four hours and about seven text books but now, I hardly read.
    <br>God has given me guidance on how to read.
    <br>We heard from the sister that before she received that deliverance, she spent hours reading,
    <br>but at the end of the day there were low grades.
    <br>But immediately after she received that deliverance, she now has a "magnetic" brain.
    <br>Anything she reads just gets stuck there and her grades improved radically.
    <br>That is indeed a radical transformation.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>What about your social life - the feeling you used to have towards women like yourself?
    <br>How is that, now that you have received your deliverance?
    <br>After my deliverance, I went back and those friends I had before were avoiding me.
    <br>Who? Mention those friends.
    <br>Those friends that had the same spirit of woman.
    <br>I think they saw something in me because even if I greeted them, it was as if I was an outcast.
    <br>I was thinking of how I was going to tell them one by one
    <br>that I was not going to associate with them anymore but God just helped me with that.
    <br>It was as if He put a mask on me that they could not recognise me.
    <br>That was how I saw myself because they would just find their way out.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That really proves that you have been taken out of this kingdom of darkness.
    <br>That evil spirit that was in you, that linked you with others having the same spirit, has been removed.
    <br>You can see that you are now a changed person.
    <br>God always gives us that evidence, proof to believe in Him.
    <br>We give God all the glory for your deliverance.
    <br>Before we go on to listen to your sister, we just want you to explain one or two things,
    <br>because we can see a board next to you.
    <br>You said that before your deliverance you had like a dull brain.
    <br>Your grades were so poor and you didn't have any hope of graduating from the university.
    <br>But after your deliverance you told us what God has done with regard to your education.
    <br>Explain to us what we are seeing on the board next to you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I don't know how to explain this because I'm so happy.
    <br>I thought that when I came out of school, I would come out with just a pass.
    <br>I thought I would fail or just pass.
    <br>I thank God of Prophet T.B. Joshua whom He used to deliver me from the hands of the devil.
    <br>I came out with a First Class Bachelor of Science in Nursing (Honours).
    <br>Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We see that you came out with First Class Honours in nursing - that is really wonderful.
    <br>This is somebody that was having very low grades.
    <br>Her grades were so poor because of the evil spirit that affected every area of her life.
    <br>It is a proof that when Jesus delivers you, He delivers you completely, effectually
    <br>and every area of your life will be transformed.
    <br>You can see the proof of this in the life of the sister.
    <br>She has shown us the results of her studies in India;
    <br>she came out with first class honours in nursing.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>What are the other documents we are seeing next to it?
    <br>The next one is my license to practise as a registered Nurse and Midwife.
    <br>Hallelujah! We give God all the glory.
    <br>You have said it all, and we give God all the glory for this wonderful thing that He has done in your life.
    <br>Before we go on to hear your own advice, we would like to listen to your sister,
    <br>whom we know that God Almighty has also transformed radically.
    <br>Please tell us your name and your testimony.
    <br>Good Morning everybody!
    <br>Good Morning, children of God!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Henrietta Anyama.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my elder sister.
    <br>Don’t get confused about the size.
    <br>She has said it all.
    <br>She is not the type that talks.
    <br>I am the mouth organ in the house.
    <br>Let me perform my own part.
    <br>My life before I received salvation was totally something I would not like to think about
    <br>or want to go back to for any reason.
    <br>Our lives in India -
    <br>and even before we travelled – we hardly went to church.
    <br>Despite my mother being a prayer warrior and my father being grounded in the things of God,
    <br>there was no push or morale to talk about God or anything related to church.
    <br>I didn’t go to church or read my Bible; I didn’t even have a Bible.
    <br>It was back in 2014 when I came to The SCOAN that I got my first Bible
    <br>and my mum bought it for me.
    <br>My life in school was a wayward life.
    <br>I smoked, drank anything and hang out with girls, not the ones that would tell me about God.
    <br>This problem really affected me but academically when you have the grace of God,
    <br>God would always be giving you signs to come back to Him.
    <br>Academically, God was always there for me.
    <br>My wayward life was really affecting me, giving me depression – I could not concentrate.
    <br>I knew that if I had died, I would not even be a step from that road that would take me to Heaven.
    <br>After the deliverance, I know I am a better person and I can take two more steps
    <br>and I would be on my way to Heaven.
    <br>It is a continuous one; it has not ended.
    <br>My sister could not control me because she was doing her own and I was doing my own.
    <br>Everybody was on their own.
    <br>If our mum called us, she would say that the man of God was praying.
    <br>I would ask, “Which man of God?”
    <br>She would reply, “Prophet T.B. Joshua”.
    <br>I would say, “We don’t hear about him here”.
    <br>She replied that it was Emmanuel TV and that we should log onto the internet.
    <br>I told her that we did not have a subscription for the internet.
    <br>When the Prophet would be praying for the viewers,
    <br>that is the time she would call us and put it on loud speaker.
    <br>We would be like, “Amen. Yes, Lord! Amen”.
    <br>When she ended the call, my sister would be wondering what was wrong with our mother.
    <br>Can you tell us what finally pulled you out of that, and today you are a living testimony?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I thank God for my mother so much.
    <br>I thank God that she was the one who gave birth to me.
    <br>It happened in 2014, when she asked us to come home.
    <br>Holiday time is the time you have fun.
    <br>How can you come to Nigeria and be caged and you don’t have freedom?
    <br>In 2014, she asked us to come home and it was like she was dragging us back to Nigeria.
    <br>What do you mean by being caged here in Nigeria?
    <br>You mean that your parents... - explain what you meant by that.
    <br>Being caged means you don’t have freedom of your own.
    <br>When you are at home, you have to be a good girl.
    <br>You can’t have bad friends or go out.
    <br>If it is 5pm at my place, you are not going anywhere.
    <br>My father will say, you are a girl and you have to stay at home.
    <br>You can’t have friends that you would go and drink with.
    <br>Where would you go and drink when everybody knows you are the daughter of this person?
    <br>You would be caged but over there, nobody knows your identity,
    <br>so you are free to do whatever thing you want to do.
    <br>I was free to do whatever thing I wanted to do.
    <br>Coming home to Nigeria was going to cut off that freedom – that was the cage I meant.
    <br>My mother asked us to come home and we came home.
    <br>We heard about Lagos and how there is a beach and cool places where you can hang out.
    <br>My mother said that we were coming to Lagos.
    <br>She even made sure that the flight would land in Lagos.
    <br>I prepared my dressing for adventure – the way I was dressed that day!
    <br>When we got here, the environment was cool, like a foreign place.
    <br>I was like, yes, they are stepping up the game.
    <br>The next thing, I saw one picture that looked like something I had seen on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I said, “This woman, so she has brought me here”.
    <br>I said that I would comply.
    <br>We were here and we were lucky we got on the prayer line and every miracle started from there.
    <br>The miracle happened when the man of God prayed for me
    <br>and it took three people to help me stand up because I had gained weight.
    <br>I stood up and that was the only thing I noticed.
    <br>There was no pain but I felt I was being lifted from the ground.
    <br>I felt lighter, more cool and differently immediately.
    <br>I started seeing things from a different perspective, other than what I used to see before.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Tell us other changes you have seen, since you received your deliverance.
    <br>As I am now, just one shot of vodka and I would want to sleep.
    <br>It would be like a sleeping tablet for the next 24 hours.
    <br>Before, no matter what they mixed, I would drink and still stand.
    <br>Now, if I just taste it, I would become tipsy.
    <br>That was a sign that the brain that was used to drinking was no longer there,
    <br>that brain had come out and a different brain is in my head.
    <br>After our deliverance, we went back to school because we were in our third year.
    <br>We went back to complete our final year.
    <br>Everything was different, our friends -
    <br>those girls who clubbed, none of them came close to me again.
    <br>It was as if something had happened to me, as if I had another face.
    <br>Even when I talked to them, they would give me attitude.
    <br>I said to myself, “Let them go; they are the ones who will lose not me”.
    <br>Regarding our grades at school – our exam time was getting close and before,
    <br>when the exam got close, we would want to be very close to our books and read
    <br>but when the exam got close after my deliverance,
    <br>I wasn’t even getting close to my books because I believed that God had done it already.
    <br>I did not put in so much human effort as before.
    <br>I am a brand new Ebere.
    <br>What about this life you used to live on campus
    <br>because you said you went back to the same school after your deliverance?
    <br>Can you tell us; when you found yourself in that same school -
    <br>how were you able to disassociate yourself from those bad friends you were involved with before?
    <br>When I got back there, they all went away.
    <br>They weren’t coming close to me anymore.
    <br>When you take out a space in your life, you have to fill it with another thing.
    <br>I wasn’t going to church.
    <br>The things of God did not interest me so much.
    <br>I joined a living church and became a part of the choir there.
    <br>When I sang hymns, people would be crying.
    <br>Watch the screen of your TV.
    <br>On the left-hand side, we can see when she was being delivered,
    <br>couple of years ago, when she came to the prayer line-section.
    <br>We can see the evil spirit in her manifesting.
    <br>That was when the evil spirit was cast out and you can see her right on the floor.
    <br>The evil spirit was totally cast out and that was how she became a changed person.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty!
    <br>Having watched this clip, we want to ask you;
    <br>you said that academically, spiritually, even your social life was totally transformed...
    <br>Can you tell us in what other way did God Almighty bless you,
    <br>before you travelled back to India to complete your studies?
    <br>Number one, I had the opportunity to get delivered.
    <br>Number two, I had the grace to get the Morning Water and the Morning Sticker
    <br>that is anointed by God through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What we did not expect happened, the man of God supported us financially.
    <br>The fresh foundation that he laid
    <br>was what brought about the good result you are seeing there.
    <br>It was not me but God.
    <br>All throughout the exams, as we were writing, all of us believed that we were going to make it
    <br>because they saw the enthusiasm in me.
    <br>Each time we submitted the paper, I would spray the Morning Water on them.
    <br>We were only allowed to go in with a pen and paper but my Morning Water was always here.
    <br>When I brought it out, they asked why I was having it.
    <br>I replied that it was my Morning Water that I used for prayer.
    <br>I took it and sprayed it on each paper, from day one to the last day of the exams.
    <br>I sprayed every paper as we were submitting them.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>And how was your grade, after you wrote your final exam,
    <br>according to what we are seeing on the board next to you?
    <br>I was not expecting anything less than First Class because I knew God was with me.
    <br>God did it. He perfected everything.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Can you just explain the documents to us?
    <br>After everything, the results came out and I got Pass-1 Division.
    <br>Now, I have a BSc Honours in Nursing – a registered Nurse and Midwife
    <br>at the Nursing Council in New Delhi, India.
    <br>Thank God!
    <br>This was our graduation picture.
    <br>This picture was taken at the final practical we had.
    <br>This is me - very happy because I knew God did it.
    <br>This is my sister.
    <br>This is me and my sister on the day of graduation.
    <br>This was our first delivery in the practical exams.
    <br>You have seen a lot of proofs of what God has done in the life of these two sisters.
    <br>We give God all the glory.
    <br>As a youth, listen to your parents because they will never deceive you.
    <br>They mean well for you.
    <br>Let us hear a word of advice from your sister.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice is for you to stick to God.
    <br>As a youth, this is the time for you to come close to God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We have heard a wonderful advice from the two sisters.
    <br>We just want to advise you as well. Now that God Almighty has set you free,
    <br>taken you out of the kingdom of darkness and placed you in the kingdom of light,
    <br>all this you have received is for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>meaning that no state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God.
    <br>Holy are you Lord
    <br>All creation calls you Lord
    <br>Worthy is Your name
    <br>We worship Your majesty
    <br>Awesome God
    <br>You are my Father
    <br>You alone
    <br>Mighty are Your miracles
    <br>Just live in me
    <br>Stay in me
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>We give God all the glory.
    <br>Once again, as you have been delivered and set free from that kingdom of darkness,
    <br>make sure you follow Jesus along the way.
    <br>We pray that God will give you that enablement and grace to continue to follow Him along the way,
    <br>so that the blessings, the deliverance you have received will remain permanent, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
