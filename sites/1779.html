    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>What kind of challenges are you facing?
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Ask Jesus to give you the grace to always cast your burden upon the Lord.
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease He cannot cure.
    <br>Never a burden He cannot bear.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know your motives are all mixed up
    <br>but certainly, you want to follow Jesus.
    <br>Your motives are all mixed up -
    <br>where you want to go is not where you are going,
    <br>what you want to say is not what you are saying,
    <br>what you want to do is not what you are doing.
    <br>Your motives are all mixed up but certainly you want to follow Jesus.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>The fear of this, the fear of that seems to paralyse you.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Jesus, release us from our fear, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Release us from our fear, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I loose whatever bondage of fear - be loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever bondage of fear - fear of this, fear of that -
    <br>be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Jesus is ready to pick us up and put us back on our feet.
    <br>He is ready.
    <br>He is ready because He wants us to be the person He created.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Lord Jesus, thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>He wants us to be the person He created.
    <br>Help us, Lord.
    <br>Help us, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Open our heart to Your faith, open our heart to Your Word,
    <br>open our heart to Your Spirit, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus, deliver us with Your righteous hand.
    <br>Deliver us, Lord, with Your righteous hand.
    <br>Deliver us, Lord, with Your righteous hand, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Those on the sickbed - we place them in Your hands, Lord.
    <br>We place them in Your healing hand.
    <br>Heal them, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliver them, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Guide the medical professionals working on them!
    <br>Guide the medical professionals working on them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Guide the medical professionals working on their bodies, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Use them to restore their health, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>To maintain our blessing,
    <br>determine to set aside a special time each day to read your Bible with devotion.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>I leave you in faith and I am expecting to meet you in faith.
    <br>This prayer is not time-bound.
    <br>Anytime you hear it, it maintains God's presence.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>In Jesus' name. Amen.
