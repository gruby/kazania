    <br>PRAY ALONG WITH PROPHET TB JOSHUA
    <br>ANOINTED PRAYER FOR 2021!!!
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Let us approach God with a humble, dependent, unpretentious attitude of the heart.
    <br>Don't just ask for something; ask for the right thing.
    <br>Ask God for mercy.
    <br>Say after me, "Son of David, have mercy on me."
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me! Let Your favour speak for me, Lord!
    <br>If you mean it, this can be a soul-saving, life-changing prayer,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Jesus, oh Jesus, touch their body for good health!
    <br>Touch their business for blessing, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Touch their career for breakthrough, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Mean it!
    <br>Touch their life for deliverance!
    <br>I can hear deliverance -
    <br>deliverance of your business,
    <br>deliverance of your health,
    <br>deliverance of your spiritual life,
    <br>deliverance of your career -
    <br>deliverance, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Touch their family for peace and unity, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Touch their life, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Touch their business for blessing!
    <br>Touch their finances for breakthrough,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>T.B. Joshua At The Prayer Mountain
    <br>God is waiting on us to speak, to act out of faith.
    <br>When we cry out to Him, He answers us.
    <br>When we lie down and sleep, we wake up in safety, for He is watching over us.
    <br>Lord Jesus, Your children need Your healing hands. Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever virus, wherever it is in their body - heal them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliver them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliver them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Those on the sickbed - deliver them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliver them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliver them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Merry Christmas! Happy New Year, in Jesus' name!
