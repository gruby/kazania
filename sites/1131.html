  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are with us.
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to view us, I know you are with us.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I can see you being positioned for healing! (Amen)
    <br>I can see you being positioned for deliverance! (Amen)
    <br>In the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>When one is positioned for healing and deliverance, what else again?
    <br>Human hand has no effect again
    <br>You have been positioned.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, you have been positioned. (Amen)
    <br>You have been positioned. (Amen)
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Once you have been positioned, healing is yours, in the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>Once you have been positioned, deliverance is yours, in the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>Once you have been positioned, blessing is yours, in the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>In the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>Viewers, I can see you being healed, in the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>Check yourself! I can see you being healed, in the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>Thomas, check yourself! In the name of Jesus, be healed! (Amen)
    <br>Thomas, check yourself! I can see you being healed, in the name of Jesus! (Amen)
    <br>Because Thomas wants to know whether he is healed,
    <br>"Let me see. Man of God said that I should check myself".
    <br>That is Thomas.
    <br>Thomas, check yourself! I say you are healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>A woman who has been on the sickbed,
    <br>you can see her getting up saying, "Oh my God! I can walk now!"
    <br>Your business can begin to walk, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your career, begin to walk, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I am seeing a woman right now; she has been on the sickbed for many years.
    <br>Right now, she is walking!
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Your business is walking right now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Your career has begun to walk, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I told you I was looking at a woman
    <br>who has been on the sickbed for many years, walking instantly.
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>It means, your business is walking!
    <br>Your career is walking now!
    <br>I say, it is walking now!
    <br>I say, your career is walking now!
    <br>Your career is walking; you should be ready to walk!
    <br>Match your actions with your words.
    <br>Right now, it is time to match your actions with your words.
    <br>When I say, "Your career is walking!", you believe.
    <br>Don't say because I said it.
    <br>This is what God asked me to tell you.
    <br>Your future is walking now!
    <br>Your career is walking now!
    <br>Your finances are walking!
    <br>Your marriage is walking!
    <br>Say, "It is walking!"
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Oh my God! This is a new dawn!
    <br>This is a new dawn!
    <br>Good Morning!
