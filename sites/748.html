    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prayer & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers powerful prayer and deliverance in the name of Jesus,
    <br>as God Almighty uses the faculties of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to expose and expel all agents of darkness operating in the lives of the people,
    <br>watch what happens to this woman as she receives a Spirit-filled touch from the man of God.
    <br>Speak out! How many are you?
    <br>We are 36.
    <br>- You say what?
    <br>- 36.
    <br>- Who is number 1?
    <br>- Snake.
    <br>- Number two!
    <br>- Fish.
    <br>- Number three!
    <br>- Anaconda.
    <br>- Number four!
    <br>- Serpent.
    <br>Who else is in this body?
    <br>Queen of the coast!
    <br>What have you done to her affection? What did you push her to do?
    <br>We chained her, she has no feelings for men.
    <br>She is used to destroy.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>I entered her, when she was 8 years old.
    <br>What else did you push her to do?
    <br>I push her to destroy many things.
    <br>And what else?
    <br>She destroyed her family, she cannot stay in her husband's house.
    <br>What is the meaning of this chain?
    <br>It's from our kingdom; they said, she should be wearing it.
    <br>For what?
    <br>To attract men.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Flora Ruth Akinpelumi.
    <br>I was born and brought up in Niger State but I came from Ondo town.
    <br>All this started - I just want to thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>God delivered me from the power of a powerful snake called anaconda.
    <br>The spirit of python, lion, fish, green, blue, black, many kinds of snakes -
    <br>36 in number inside of me.
    <br>So all this started, when I was 8 years old, in Niger State.
    <br>My mummy took us to a river called Sharabash to wash plates and clothes.
    <br>When we got to the stream, we washed the clothes and plates,
    <br>and my mum asked us to take our baths. Then we bathed inside the stream.
    <br>Then later on I saw a boat and then climbed onto that boat.
    <br>I was bathing.
    <br>Then later on I felt my body changed. I was heavy and so tired inside of me.
    <br>Then my mummy said I am going extreme to the water and I should come out of the water.
    <br>So whilst you were actually bathing in that river, you physically felt as if something entered inside of you?
    <br>I felt, when I was bathing on that boat that something entered me,
    <br>and I felt so heavy and tired, I didn't know what I was doing again.
    <br>Then my mummy said we should come out from the water, which I did.
    <br>We were taken back home, then I went straight to my room, fell on the bed and slept off.
    <br>Then the next morning I woke up and felt so tired.
    <br>My brothers and sisters had dressed for school
    <br>but I told my mom that I could not go to school because I didn't understand myself.
    <br>Then I asked her, "Mommy, I am hungry; I want to eat",
    <br>She gave me a plate of rice. I finished it. I demanded for another plate.
    <br>I finished it. I demanded for another one and finished it.
    <br>Then she asked me, "What is really wrong with you?"
    <br>I said, "It looks as if that food that I am eating,
    <br>something is inside me that is eating that food; I don't get myself".
    <br>Since then, the spirit inside me started causing more problems in the family.
    <br>Okay, sister, we just want to understand clearly.
    <br>You said that your first experience was that you began eating excessively,
    <br>as if there was something within you that was actually taking that food.
    <br>And after that, what was the next experience you had spiritually
    <br>that made you realise that this demon had really entered inside of you?
    <br>I felt weak and heavy, so tired.
    <br>Whenever I ate that food, something inside of me shrinks inside my tummy.
    <br>Then I felt that something was eating the food in my stomach.
    <br>Since then I started acting strangely in the family.
    <br>Sometimes my mommy would talk to me. I would not even listen to her.
    <br>I just wanted to be by myself, I just wanted to do things on my own.
    <br>Then, I dreamt that a big snake entered into my private part -
    <br>since then, if I was sleeping, I would be feeling sexy and would be making love in the dream
    <br>and flying all over the place; sometimes I used to fly all over the world.
    <br>I used to fly to many places, I travelled out and even went to the market,
    <br>buying things from old women.
    <br>Since then, things started changing.
    <br>So you are talking about what was happening in the dream after this experience,
    <br>where this demon entered you, a snake entered through your private part
    <br>and you began to have all these experiences in the dream.
    <br>Physically, as you were growing up, what began to happen to you as you got a little bit
    <br>more mature and this spirit began to operate in your life?
    <br>When I got to the age of 15, that snake inside of me told me everything I should do.
    <br>If maybe I was on the way, it would direct me to a shop -
    <br>my people in the other realm were the ones that owned that shop.
    <br>When you say 'my people', can you just explain what you mean by that?
    <br>That is my colleagues in the other realm, the other kingdom.
    <br>They directed me to shops to get some weaves and clothes to attract men.
    <br>Some of these clothes and weaves I put on were just to attract men.
    <br>And chains and earrings.
    <br>They described the shops,
    <br>"Go to this shop, get these clothes, get this weave so that when you put them on,
    <br>when men see you, they will be seduced and attracted to you".
    <br>And not only men, even ladies too were attracted whenever I put all these things on.
    <br>Okay, so in the dream, in the spiritual world, you were directed to go to
    <br>a physical shop and purchase some items that were then used
    <br>as a means of seducing men and also attracting people to you.
    <br>So when you now went to the shops and bought those items,
    <br>where agents from that kingdom were actually operating,
    <br>you now started wearing those things and using them - what began to happen?
    <br>When I put those things on, my friends would say, "Baby, you are sweet", and this and that.
    <br>"Can you accompany us to a party, a club?"
    <br>Then I would go with them to the club.
    <br>In the spirit, in the other realm, I was a princess called 'The queen of the coast'.
    <br>I had a position there as a leader and we had this big spiritual band.
    <br>Whenever they wanted to do anything, 
    <br> gathering or party, they would call me
    <br>that I should come out to dance.
    <br>After dancing - the way I used to dance in the other realm - in the physical, I would dance the same way
    <br>that I danced in the spiritual realm, with my friends in the club.
    <br>When I was dancing my dance, they would just give me the sign on how to twist and seduce men with dance.
    <br>So many men would be attracted, when I was dancing and from there, some of the guys really wanted me.
    <br>Some even came there with their girlfriends but when they saw me dancing,
    <br>those dances would seduce them and they would start fighting,
    <br>push their girlfriends, "No, no, no, I don't want you anymore".
    <br>They would now come to me because of that dance and say, "Baby, please, can you dance more?"
    <br>Then I would dance for them. They would start fighting because of me.
    <br>Then I would have to run away from that place because I didnt wan't to be bruised.
    <br>Then I would run out from that place.
    <br>So the men that you ended up seducing, and then going out to meet them -
    <br>just tell us, what would happen when you met with those men;
    <br>what would then happen in their lives as a consequence of this?
    <br>Yes, it's good for the men that don't hear...
    <br>You know what? The snake that entered me caused commotion.
    <br>Any man that slept with me would never say, "No, I am going. I will stay, please give me more
    <br>because you are sweet". But they never knew that they were sleeping with a snake.
    <br>They fixed it in the mouth of the snake.
    <br>So the snake would take the sperm to the other kingdom,
    <br>and we used the sperm to increase my wealth and riches.
    <br>On the other side I had so many houses, I had cars and many other things.
    <br>I had gold, dollars and millions.
    <br>Okay, now sister, you are talking spiritually here, that when you slept with men,
    <br>that spirit of snake within you was actually the person those men were sleeping with and
    <br>that spirit would take their sperm; now physically, what would now happen to such men?
    <br>Maybe they were business men or they were married men, what would happen to them
    <br>as a result of encountering you and sleeping with you?
    <br>Those men that slept with me, some had affection for me.
    <br>There were those that I really wanted, maybe I felt free with them
    <br>and they were free with me, I would just let go.
    <br>But those that were hard, maybe when  things were going well for them,
    <br>maybe they had money and they didn't want to give me, then I would take all their wealth back,
    <br>and every blessing they had - I would take it back.
    <br>And if they were married?
    <br>If those men that met with you were married men, once they encountered you,
    <br>what would happen to their marital lives?
    <br>Because of the affection that I had for the man and because of what the man had for me
    <br>due to the power inside of me, I had lured him and drawn him from his wife.
    <br>So they would start having problems, commotion in the family and nagging,
    <br>until the husband would throw her out of the house.
    <br>Okay, so I think we have been listening to our sister.
    <br>This is a lesson for those who are present here and our viewers all over the world.
    <br>Our sister is explaining that because of the demonic powers that were within her,
    <br>what would happen to men that were seduced  by her, when she danced in the night clubs
    <br>and end uped sleeping with her and the destruction that would actually happen in their lives afterwards.
    <br>Now, sister, you mentioned that there were many different ways,
    <br>in which you were seducing men, there were some certain items that you were given.
    <br>Can you just explain to us how those items - perhaps, the chains and other things -
    <br>how they were used as a tool to attract and seduce such men?
    <br>You know, all those things I put on - you that has physical eyes, you will not see.
    <br>But those that have spiritual eyes will see it because whenever I put it on,
    <br>the spirit has already attached itself to it.
    <br>Okay, you are just holding something for us here.
    <br>Can you just explain what it is you are actually holding
    <br>and just explain the function that it had in your life in the past, when you had this evil spirit.
    <br>This chain is for mission. They sent me to put it on.
    <br>So anytime I put it on my leg, my leg had already been possessed.
    <br>The leg was possessed - it was not an ordinary leg.
    <br>When I put it on, any man that set his eyes on my leg and on the chain
    <br>would be attracted, come to me and ask me out.
    <br>Then I would say, "No problem".
    <br>Okay, so we can remember that during the deliverance of our sister,
    <br>this was the chain that was around her leg as she came to The SCOAN,
    <br>as that was the power of darkness that she was using at that time to destroy
    <br>and really cause a lot of commotion in many people's lives.
    <br>Sister, can you continue with your confession.
    <br>Apart from the issue of destroying men, which other areas did these spirits begin to use you?
    <br>They used me in so many ways, to destroy husbands and wives,
    <br>even neighbours, to cause problems, misunderstandings.
    <br>These spirits caused me anger - whenever I was angry, I fought with weapons, bottles and knives.
    <br>In fact there was a woman in Benin, she provoked me.
    <br>Then I just used the bottle and bashed it on her.
    <br>I wanted to stab her and then she ran away.
    <br>Mistakenly, the bottle cut me and my blood flowed because my people wanted blood.
    <br>Whenever the blood gushed out, I would feel calm and relieved.
    <br>My mission was accomplished.
    <br>Okay, so whenever you were angry, you would not calm down, until you saw blood?
    <br>So you had to injure that person with the weapon for blood to flow before you would calm down?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Okay, you have mentioned some areas in your life that began to be affected negatively.
    <br>Can you explain, apart from these men that were coming to you as you were seducing them -
    <br>what about the area of relationships and marriages on your side?
    <br>Men that approached you for marriage - just tell us what happened.
    <br>Many men asked me for marriage and those husbands that asked my hand in marriage
    <br>were the ones that the spirit pushed to me; they were not my real husband.
    <br>Those spirits pushed them to me because they didn't want me to get married.
    <br>They just wanted me to be their princess, sending me on errands to do whatsoever
    <br>but due to the force to be a mother, I just wanted to be a mother and have a baby.
    <br>Then a man came into my life. His name is Umobi, we were dating.
    <br>I had two children with him - Blessed Samuel and Mercy.
    <br>We were married together and were fine, no problem.
    <br>Until one certain night, I had a spiritual husband - a black and a white.
    <br>So you had two different spiritual husbands?
    <br>Yes, I had two spiritual husbands: very giant.
    <br>One was like a goliath - the black one, tall, giant and huge.
    <br>Then the other one was fair and light in complexion.
    <br>So one faithful night we were sleeping, I and my husband.
    <br>The black spirit was very jealous; it could kill;
    <br>it could even stab someone because it didn't want to see me with any man,
    <br>talkless of being with a man.
    <br>One fateful night, I was just sleeping on the bed.
    <br>Then I saw that spiritual husband, the giant one, goliath who was very huge and black.
    <br>He just came and was standing in the corridor and woke me up.
    <br>He said I should wake my husband up, that he wanted to have fun with me.
    <br>Then he tapped my husband; I saw the spiritual husband face to face,
    <br>he was standing at the door post.
    <br>Then he said that I should wake my husband up; I tapped my husband.
    <br>Then he controlled my husband and turned his memory and told him,
    <br>"Go to this place and wait".
    <br>My husband stood up, went to that place and waited.
    <br>Then the spiritual husband lied on the bed and had fun with me.
    <br>After having fun with me, it deposited sharp pains in my private part.
    <br>So when my husband wanted to have fun with me, I would just shout and say,
    <br> "No, please I don't need you, I don't want to have fun because that place is pepperish".
    <br>So as a result of this, what then happened to this marriage with your two children?
    <br>The marriage crumbled and since then my husband has thrown me out, took the children and run away.
    <br>Since then I have not set my eyes on them.
    <br>So you mean that since then, you have not seen your husband and your two children; for how long now?
    <br>Up to four years now - four years.
    <br>So after this first encounter with your first husband, what then happened after that?
    <br>After that I ran to Ondo town and I started working there as a security personnel.
    <br>Then I met a guy again, we started going out together and I got pregnant.
    <br>The same spirit that threw me out from the first one, threw me out from the second one
    <br>because of everything - nagging and fighting, shouting and breaking bottles.
    <br>All said and done, he threw me out of the house.
    <br>Because you were so violent in the house, you were thrown out for the second time
    <br>and you had a child with that man as well?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So we can understand that apart from how the spirit was using our sister to destroy others,
    <br>it also destroyed her own life, rendering her without any husband,
    <br>children for different men and her whole family scattered.
    <br>So, can you tell us, sister, in the midst of all of this - how did you come to be at The SCOAN last weak?
    <br>Before I was in Lagos, I was in Ondo, and my friend called me.
    <br>She said, "Flora, can you please come down to Lagos?"
    <br>Because I was so scattered and disgusted, frustrated, no job, nowhere to stay,
    <br>nobody to call upon, I called her one day, "Please, can you help me, I need a job".
    <br>Then she said that I should come down to Lagos; I packed my things and came down to Lagos.
    <br>She allowed me to stay with her, then we slept on the same bed.
    <br>Sometimes she would wake me up and say, "Flora, I don't understand the way you sleep.
    <br>I don't get you, that you are not yourself, you disappear, your body - you leave your body".
    <br>Sometimes she would tap me but I would not wake up
    <br>until I had gone to do the assignment they had sent me to do.
    <br>Then I explained everything to her and she said, "Baby, please, you have to go to
    <br>a strong church so that you will be delivered from this power"
    <br>because she knew I was not an ordinary person.
    <br>I asked, "Which church do you want me to go to?"
    <br>She said, "Synagogue, Church Of All Nations".
    <br>Then I prepared. Last week Sunday I was here.
    <br>I was sitting outside when the man of God was preaching and saying,
    <br>"Please, some people here - what makes them not to receive their blessing,
    <br>is because they don't know how to pray.
    <br>They pray ha-ha-ha-ha and their problem is still there.
    <br>The only thing that you have to do when you pray is to pray within yourself, inner yourself".
    <br>And there was a prayer point that day.
    <br>The prayer point was, "Take more of me and give me more of You".
    <br>I was meditating within myself and saying, "What kind of a prayer point is this?
    <br>How can somebody take more of me and give me more of himself".
    <br>So I was not following them to pray that prayer, "I don't understand this.
    <br>How can somebody take more of me and give me more of himself?"
    <br>I said, "I will not pray this prayer".
    <br>Some people that were seated beside me were just looking at me, "This girl is not praying".
    <br>Later on, the man of God repeated it again.
    <br>I said, "I'm even tired, let me stand up and go back home".
    <br>That spirit said, "Stand up, take your purse and leave this place
    <br>because the man of God is coming out with fire".
    <br>I said, "Fire? If it is that, I am not staying in this place".
    <br>When I wanted to pick my purse, something just knocked on my head,
    <br>"Where are you going to?"
    <br>I turned to my left and right - I couldn't see the person.
    <br>Then I said, "Let me take my purse and run away".
    <br>As I wanted to take my purse and run away, something just slapped me.
    <br>Then I screamed and shouted.
    <br>Then the usher ushered me out.
    <br>I had the opportunity to be touched by the man of God.
    <br>Just to understand exactly what our sister is saying -
    <br>that was the exact moment where Prophet T.B. Joshua started the mass prayer,
    <br>and at that moment, the Holy Spirit arrested our sister.
    <br>After that, we saw that you were privileged to receive prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Can you just describe to us what happened when you encountered him during that time of prayer.
    <br>When that power slapped, I don't know where that power came from,
    <br>but I know somebody slapped me on my head.
    <br>He slapped me on my head and I felt something shaking in my body
    <br>and I felt fire inside of me and I started shouting and screaming,
    <br>"Man of God, don't touch me, I hate you!" before they brought me to the centre of the church.
    <br>When you then received prayer, as we are seeing on the screen, describe to us what happened at that point.
    <br>The man of God touched me and I was delivered totally.
    <br>I felt that something gushed out of me, I feel relief inside of me.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sister, we want to understand clearly the experiences in your life after your deliverance.
    <br>Just tell us, ever since  the deliverance you received last week, what are the changes
    <br>you have seen in your life to testify that that spirit has left you completely.
    <br>I feel so relieved since that deliverance.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, I felt so relieved, I felt so okay.
    <br>I talk to people, I associate with them, sitting together.
    <br>I sleep like a baby, I wake up like a baby, I eat normal.
    <br>I don't dream those kind of dreams again.
    <br>Many other things like that - good things.
    <br>Before I used to be angry, but now, I am not angry anymore.
    <br>I feel happy, I chat with others like my friends, I am free.
    <br>I am delivered, I am okay.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So that spirit that was formally using you to go out to seduce men and dance in a way
    <br>in clubs to attract men - you no longer have interest in such things or desire to do such things?
    <br>I don't have those feelings anymore.
    <br>Even like yesterday, some of those men came to me and said,
    <br>"Please, dance for me" and I said, "I am not for those things anymore, I am a changed person".
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Truly, the evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.
    <br>Now we believe our sister has a lot advice
    <br>for our viewers all over the world based on her own experiences in life,
    <br>and as someone who was part of the kingdom of darkness before.
    <br>Sister, what do you really want to advise people concerning your life experiences,
    <br>especially people that, for example, used to go to clubs, men who are used to
    <br>chase after ladies, even though they are married - what would you like to advise them
    <br>as someone who was an agent of darkness in the past?
    <br>Men that don't hear words, they will miss the mark.
    <br>But those that hear words, they will have the relief.
    <br>I just want to advise the viewers - not only men but also women, youth and children,
    <br>You just have to stay away from glittery things because all that glitters is not gold.
    <br>You would see some ladies beautiful outside but you don't know what is inside of them.
    <br>Some men would just say, "Oh God, this girl is beautiful, I love her shape, she is 'figure 8'"
    <br>and they would start coming.
    <br>You men, you just have to be careful.
    <br>Be careful of what you do outside and take time,
    <br>not going out to a party or a club, drinking and any other thing, you just have to stop it.
    <br>Mothers, advise your children what to put on, what they wear and where they go to.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sister, we believe there are many people watching you right now that are actually under the bondage
    <br>you were once in and perhaps they too, after listening to your experience,
    <br>know that they too have a similar spirit that is dwelling in them
    <br>or perhaps they have encountered someone in the past that has initiated them into such.
    <br>As people who are in need of deliverance -
    <br>as someone that is standing here who has been delivered right now -
    <br>what do you want to advise such people that are still in that bondage?
    <br>Those people that are still in that bondage, I just want them to open their hearts freely,
    <br>so that they can be delivered.
    <br>When you harden your heart, you are hardening your problem and your deliverance.
    <br>But when you open your heart, you will be delivered and freed from all those powers.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We thank God for our sister's life, we thank God that she has been taken into the Kingdom of light.
    <br>We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance by making the Word of God
    <br>the standard for your life and we know that as you do so, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
