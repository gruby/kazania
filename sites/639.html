    <br>My name is Daniel Ejeh. I reside in Niger state, Nigeria.
    <br>This is my wife and these are my children.
    <br>They have accused me of being a wizard,
    <br>as a result of two of my children who died mysteriously.
    <br>Not only that, some of my relatives also accused me.
    <br>This is how it happened:
    <br>the first one, my son, died.
    <br>Secondly, my first daughter died last year.
    <br>They have all accused me of killing my children using witchcraft.
    <br>They say I should come here to confirm whether I am a wizard or not.
    <br>Lord, I pray, I want the man of God to help me, to tell the whole world
    <br>whether I am a wizard or not, whether I'm the killer of my children or not.
    <br>Let the world witness the whole thing.
    <br>My wife has not been cooking for me for more than eight years now.
    <br>There is nothing like a relationship between husband and wife.
    <br>My children have neglected me, maltreated me,
    <br>even abused me by saying that I'm a useless father.
    <br>I don’t know what to do.
    <br>Man of God, kindly come and rescue me from this predicament.
    <br>My name is Mrs Agnes Ejeh.
    <br>This is my husband; these are my children.
    <br>I married this man, we were living happily until he lost his job.
    <br>Then he joined a chemist seller (pharmacy).
    <br>When he joined the association, everything changed in the house
    <br>to the extent that I got sick. I was seriously sick.
    <br>They carried me to so many places to confirm what was wrong with me.
    <br>Nobody knew the solution. Then they took me home.
    <br>From there, they confirmed that my husband
    <br>was the one who wanted to kill me,
    <br>and that he was the one causing the harm.
    <br>After that, my son died without falling sick, he just died like that.
    <br>They confirmed that my husband was killing my children using witchcraft.
    <br>Four years later, my daughter was cooking in the kitchen and
    <br>fire came from nowhere and burnt her.
    <br>We took her to Enugu hospital. We were there for two years.
    <br>My husband abandoned me and my daughter there.
    <br>My husband is responsible for the witchcraft.
    <br>We went to many places to confirm – from both herbalists and men of God.
    <br>They confirmed that he's a great wizard.
    <br>I went to church; they were praying. They told him to stand up and then said,
    <br>"You are a great wizard; you killed two of your children."
    <br>They told me that he has a python under his bed
    <br>and that is what he is using to kill my children.
    <br>He denied it.
    <br>He said that he didn’t know anything about it.
    <br>He abandoned me and my children. I'm the one taking care of their food.
    <br>Whether we get food, or not – he doesn’t care about us.
    <br>No school, no job – he doesn’t care.
    <br>He will never sit down for one day and think about what is happening in my family.
    <br>I am Esther Ejeh.
    <br>It all started in 2001 when we lost our brother.
    <br>After they took him home for the burial, we went to a witchdoctor
    <br>who confirmed that my father was responsible for the killing.
    <br>After four years, there was an incident of which we cannot explain how it happened.
    <br>I got burnt and I was taken to the hospital.
    <br>I spent close to two years in hospital.
    <br>He abandoned me and my mother in the hospital.
    <br>So, it was only my mum who was taking care of me for that period in the hospital.
    <br>We believe that he is responsible for what happened to me.
    <br>Four years later, my elder sister who all the family put their hope in,
    <br>died a month after her youth service had ended.
    <br>They took her corpse home. After the burial they went to confirm.
    <br>They said that my dad was responsible.
    <br>I believe that he is a wizard.
    <br>My name is Mr Henry Ejeh.
    <br>They said that our dad was a wizard and that he was responsible for our elder sister's death.
    <br>They even said that I'm the next person in line to die.
    <br>They have dreams – seeing me in a coffin.
    <br>He's a wizard, sir.
    <br>My name is Mr Douglas Ejeh.
    <br>My father is a wizard.
    <br>It happened like this:
    <br>My first brother died, I wasn’t around.
    <br>I came back from school, they told me that my brother had died and they had buried him.
    <br>Secondly, my sister, suddenly after her National Youth Corps Service,
    <br>she just came home and a month later, she died too.
    <br>He was responsible for the killing of our brother and sister.
    <br>That is why we came here – to confirm if really he is the one.
    <br>My name is Miss Comfort Ejeh.
    <br>My father is a wizard.
    <br>The reason I say so is because I used to be very close to him
    <br>but when everything happened, I was so scared and everybody was accusing him.
    <br>I believed everything my mum told me and everything I was seeing in the family - that he's a wizard.
    <br>I want to ask you a question.
    <br>Who is T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Before we go into the matter.
    <br>A prophet of God.
    <br>You are a prophet.
    <br>Why did you choose to come here?
    <br>To find out whether our dad is a wizard.
    <br>I want to join your family.
    <br>Will you accept me?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I am joining this family.
    <br>Anything you want to do - before we talk.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>If I say something now, it will strike your mind.
    <br>Every one of us will ask for forgiveness.
    <br>What are we asking forgiveness for?
    <br>Because we cannot act with God.
    <br>So, we cannot know God's opinion about ourselves and about others.
    <br>That is the sin we have committed.
    <br>Tell your neighbor; "The sin you have committed -
    <br>you cannot act with God".
    <br>Once you cannot act with God,
    <br>you will not know God's opinion,
    <br>about yourself and about others.
    <br>Everyone here has committed the same sin you have committed today.
    <br>This man is being judged by his character.
    <br>Very, very, very, tough – too tough.
    <br>It has now become affliction. He is now being judged by his attitude.
    <br>He is not a wizard.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>I bless Your name forever.
    <br>I magnify Your name forever.
    <br>You are everlasting God, King of Kings.
    <br>Oh God, thank You.
    <br>Thank You.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>OK, no problem.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>OK, don't worry - it is alright.
    <br>I will host you people.
    <br>There is nothing like a wizard in this man.
    <br>So please, let us go on our knees.
    <br>One thing you owe God now – forgiveness.
    <br>You need to forgive because you need to be forgiven.
    <br>Don't count it against your wife or your children, what has happened in the past.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>There is nothing to be delivered from, when he is not a wizard.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>It is an affliction that they would be lying against you anywhere you go.
    <br>Man of God, thank you for helping me.
    <br>Thank you for uniting my family together.
    <br>I pray that God will enlarge your coasts,
    <br>that the ministry will grow from strength to strength, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>What is the cause of the death of the two children and the tragedy in the house?
    <br>It is true that death is roaming about in the family
    <br>and it is true that another person is working towards the death of another person.
    <br>What you said is nothing but the truth that there is another person.
    <br>There is spirit of death going round the house.
    <br>Ask your father, he will tell you what happened to his brothers in his family.
    <br>It is not your father, but there is a spirit of death at a certain level.
    <br>Because they know these children, they are saviours of the home.
    <br>This death is not coming through your father, it is a generational curse -
    <br>being inherited.
    <br>Remember before you had this fire burn, you fasted a week after that fire burn.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The same day this happened to me, I was so sad throughout the day
    <br>that they asked me what was wrong with me but I couldn’t explain it.
    <br>That was the same day in the night, that this happened to me.
    <br>If not that fasting and prayer you did, you would have died.
    <br>Now, the home will be delivered.
    <br>What you need to do for me now - give your father love.
    <br>Give your husband love.
    <br>Reconciliation Time
    <br>After the Sunday service, the Ejeh family ate a meal together,
    <br>with all of the family seated around the same table happy and content.
    <br>The love of God has been restored to this home, as Mr Ejeh lovingly gives his wife a drink,
    <br>and smiles being on all of their faces.
    <br>Let's hear from them.
    <br>We want to thank God for the reconciliation of this family and for a good future ahead -
    <br>we want to say, "Cheers!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, the family drinks a toast to their reconciliation, and the bright future ahead.
    <br>Thanks to the prophetic revelation of T.B. Joshua that Mr Ejeh is not a wizard,
    <br>nor is he responsible for their trouble.
    <br>And now that the man of God has also exposed the cause of their problem,
    <br>the unity among the family is as if there had never been a problem.
    <br>Family Reconciled
    <br>In fact, I am very grateful, very happy.
    <br>There is no adjective to describe my joy today!
    <br>I really thank God for this unity.
    <br>In fact, we are just like a new couple today!
    <br>Glory be to God in the name of Jesus.
    <br>The sky is my limit. I don’t know how to express the kind of joy,
    <br>that is going through my mind.
    <br>I just give God the glory for everything.
    <br>I feel so excited and happy for the reconciling of my family like this.
    <br>To sit at the same table to eat happily, peacefully -
    <br>I thank God for what God has done in our lives.
    <br>Indeed I am very happy; I am so excited that I can't express what is going through my mind now.
    <br>I really thank God for this. This is really a union.
    <br>I am very happy; I am very excited; I am full of joy!
    <br>I don’t know how to say it, but I really thank God for what He has done.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>After so many years of my labour, the Lord has given me joy in my heart.
