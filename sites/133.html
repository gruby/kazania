    133 - FAITH IS A HEAVENLY CURRENCY TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers at home, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>We are waiting for a touch from Heaven.
    <br>If you say, "Touch me Lord and let it be to me according to my faith",
    <br>will you be able to say that?
    <br>Touch me and let it be to me according to my faith.
    <br>Think about it; do you have faith?
    <br>"Touch me and let it be to me according to my faith"
    <br>because we use faith to put a demand.
    <br>Faith is a Heavenly currency we use to purchase, to receive Heavenly blessings.
    <br>Healing is a Heavenly blessing;
    <br>deliverance is a Heavenly blessing;
    <br>salvation - they are all Heavenly blessings.
    <br>To receive these, faith is like a Heavenly currency.
    <br>To purchase something in the market, you need money.
    <br>When you get to the market, you begin to negotiate,
    <br>- "How much is this?"
    <br>- "5 Naira."
    <br>You have 3 Naira; that money is not enough.
    <br>That does not mean you don't have money.
    <br>If you get to the market and they say "10 dollars" for what you want to purchase,
    <br>and you have 9 dollars, you will try to get your way.
    <br>They say, "No, it is 10 dollars" and you have 9 dollars.
    <br>What you need to do - you go back and get more money.
    <br>That does not mean you don't have money.
    <br>In the same vein, when you say, "Heal me, heal me" and you are not healed,
    <br>that does not mean you don't have faith.
    <br>It is only the measure of faith to purchase that healing you don't have.
    <br>Let me see your hand.
    <br>Am I talking to you?
    <br>You want to buy this in the market.
    <br>On getting to the market, they say it is 10 dollars, but you have 7 dollars with you.
    <br>You begin to negotiate to bring the price down - "No, it is 10 dollars."
    <br>There is nothing you can do.
    <br>You can't get that thing, but that does not mean you don't have money.
    <br>In the same vein, to receive that Heavenly blessing we are all waiting for,
    <br>you need Heavenly currency to receive it.
    <br>If you ask for something and you do not receive it,
    <br>that does not mean you do not have faith
    <br>but the measure of faith you need to purchase,
    <br>to receive that, you do not have.
    <br>Remember what Jesus said to His disciples.
    <br>When the father of the demon-possessed boy ran after Jesus, saying,
    <br>'Jesus, I brought my son to Your disciples for them to deliver him;
    <br>they could not because they did not have power to do so'.
    <br>Jesus said, 'No, don't say that; this is blasphemy! They have power
    <br>but they lack the measure of faith to release the power'.
    <br>That means they have power, but the measure, the degree of faith;
    <br>that does not mean they do not have faith, but the degree,
    <br>the amount of faith they need to get that power to deliver the boy...
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's open our Bible; just a proof text - the Book of Luke 6:37.
    <br>"Judge not, and you shall not be judged.
    <br>Condemn not and you shall not be condemned.
    <br>Forgive, and you shall be forgiven."
    <br>Now, that should be the weapon.
    <br>If you say, "Touch me and let it be to me according to my faith",
    <br>you mean, if you forgive others, you will be forgiven.
    <br>If you condemn others, you will be condemned.
    <br>If you show mercy to others, you will also receive mercy.
    <br>That is what we are saying.
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>If I show mercy to others, I will receive mercy.
    <br>If I help others, I will receive help
    <br>because the Bible says, "Whatever you do to the least of my fellow brothers,
    <br>that you do to me".
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If you say, "I help others",
    <br>or you have not but right now, you are ready to help others,
    <br>you should be ready to be helped.
    <br>You have not been showing mercy, kindness to others but on coming here,
    <br>you have seen the reason you should show mercy and kindness to others.
    <br>In your heart, what you are saying now, 'If I should leave here today, my life is a changed one.
    <br>I will help others; I will show mercy to others'.
    <br>Now, you should be ready.
    <br>God will not wait till you leave here to do that
    <br>but immediately, you will begin to receive that mercy.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>That is the meaning of, "Touch me and let it be to me according to my faith".
    <br>What is faith?
    <br>Without love, no faith.
    <br>Without faith, no love.
    <br>Love is the motto of faith.
    <br>Love is life in faith.
    <br>No love, no life in faith.
    <br>No love, lifeless faith.
    <br>That is why many of us say, "We have faith" - it is faithless; you have faith but no love.
    <br>So, once again.
    <br>Show mercy to others and be of help to others.
    <br>Whatever you can do, do to see that your life is for the services of others.
    <br>Touch me and let it be to me according to my faith.
    <br>What kind of faith are you talking about?
    <br>That is, you are saying, "According to my love to others".
    <br>Touch me and let it be to me according to my love to others,
    <br>my kindness to others, my goodness to others -
    <br>touch me and let it be to me accordingly.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Remember the words of wisdom.
    <br>Touch me and let it be to me according to my love to others.
    <br>Touch me and let it be to me according to my kindness to others.
    <br>Touch me Lord and let it be to me according to my blessing to others,
    <br>forgiveness to others.
    <br>These are ingredients of faith.
    <br>Touch me Lord and let it be to me according to my mercy to others,
    <br>goodness, kindness, love, help, and forgiveness to others - touch me Lord.
    <br>This means that on these conditions, you can receive a touch,
    <br>a touch from Heaven.
    <br>Because the Bible says that faith releases the healing anointing.
    <br>Faith releases the deliverance anointing.
    <br>Faith releases the blessing anointing.
    <br>If you now say, "Touch me Lord and let it be to me according to my love, kindness, blessing,
    <br>help, forgiveness to others"...
    <br>Can you see on what condition God touches?
    <br>When the Lord touches you and you are healed,
    <br>your energy, your good health - for the services of others.
    <br>When the Lord touches you and your business revives,
    <br>and you begin to have good customers and others,
    <br>the blessing is also for others.
    <br>When the Lord touches you and you have a breakthrough in your life,
    <br>you are blessed to bless others;
    <br>you are going to be delivered to deliver others;
    <br>you are going to be healed to heal others.
    <br>Take note of this word.
    <br>Touch me, Oh Lord and let it be to me according to my love,
    <br>kindness, blessing, help, forgiveness to others.
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>When the Lord touches you, you are healed.
    <br>When the Lord touches you, you are delivered.
    <br>When you are touched, you are free.
    <br>That blessing you are waiting for now, can only be received by faith,
    <br>which is a Heavenly currency.
    <br>You want to purchase something in the market, you carry money there.
    <br>Heavenly blessings - healing, deliverance - they are Heavenly things.
    <br>If you want to receive them, you need this Heavenly currency to purchase them.
    <br>The amount of currency you have will determine the amount of blessing you receive.
    <br>If you cannot receive today does not mean you don't have faith.
    <br>It is the degree of faith you need that you probably don't have,
    <br>the measure of faith you need, you probably don't have,
    <br>not that you don't have faith - don't condemn yourself.
    <br>That does not mean you are not a child of God.
    <br>You shouldn't say, "Because my prayer is not answered, I'm not a child of God".
    <br>You are still a child of God.
    <br>"My prayer is not answered, I am not a child of God" -
    <br>that is what the devil is using to disturb the children of God.
    <br>When the devil knows that you are not grounded in the Word of God, he will begin to wait.
    <br>When what you ask from God, you do not receive it,
    <br>he will come in and say, "Can you see, you are not a child of God?"
    <br>Your mind will begin to be disturbed, "Truly, I'm not a child of God.
    <br>If I'm a child of God, God should give me what I asked for.
    <br>I have been on it for many years now.
    <br>I keep asking God, 'Give me...' Others are receiving, I'm not receiving."
    <br>The devil is the one doing that.
    <br>He will just wait.
    <br>When you offer prayer and it is not answered, he will come to you and say,
    <br>"Can you see, you are not a child of God? If you are a child of God, you should receive it."
    <br>You become disturbed.
    <br>Now, you will become more of devil.
    <br>When you know, when your mind says, "I'm not a child of God", what else again;
    <br>you will smoke the more, you will lie the more.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>These are the intrigues and tactics satan is using to disturb the people of God.
    <br>That you pray and you are not receiving answers to your prayers
    <br>does not mean you are not a child of God.
    <br>What has happened here? Listen.
    <br>Probably you don't have the degree, the measure of faith to receive that thing.
    <br>I have given you a good example of money.
    <br>You need 10 dollars to purchase this.
    <br>On getting to the market, you never knew you needed 10 dollars, but you have 7 dollars.
    <br>Getting to the market, you say, "I want to buy this".
    <br>They say, "No, it is 10 dollars".
    <br>- "No, please, it is 6, 7 dollars."
    <br>- "No, it is 10 dollars."
    <br>And you move around everywhere - they say 10 dollars.
    <br>You have to go back and get enough money to purchase it,
    <br>but that does not mean you don't have money or that you are poor.
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>To the things of God now.
    <br>You want to receive blessing from God, Heavenly blessing -
    <br>you need Heavenly currency to receive it.
    <br>You want healing - you pray and you are not receiving healing,
    <br>probably you don't have the degree, the measure of faith to receive that healing.
    <br>That does not mean you are not a child of God;
    <br>that does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>You just need to continue to press on, keep growing in faith
    <br>so as to receive what you need from God.
    <br>Jesus said to His disciples...
    <br>This kind, that is what Jesus means, this kind of fruit can only be purchased by 10 dollars, not 7 dollars.
    <br>That does not mean the disciples are devils or unbelievers.
    <br>He said, "Pray and fast; you need to grow in faith to do that kind".
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Don't allow the devil to disturb you.
    <br>When you offer prayer, "Father, I need this" and you are not receiving it,
    <br>that does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>You are still a Christian; all you need is the measure of faith to receive that kind.
    <br>Hearing and obeying the Word of God grows your faith.
    <br>Devil uses this.
    <br>You will see people that are Christians; yesterday and today they are pagans,
    <br>or somebody you see as a Christian - suddenly you will find him in the club house.
    <br>You say, "What happened?"
    <br>"I prayed... I'm looking for a job but no answer to my prayer. What am I wasting my time for?
    <br>Let me go back to the world." - No.
    <br>Satan uses this.
    <br>Your prayer, relationship with God, "In Jesus' name, I need this" - the answer has not yet come.
    <br>Satan comes immediately and says, "Look, you are not a child of God. Come to me".
    <br>When satan says that you are not a child of God, he is telling you, "Come to me".
    <br>Satan has his own way.
    <br>As Jesus said, "Come unto Me all ye that labour",
    <br>so, when you say, "Jesus, I need bread" and you are not receiving that bread,
    <br>satan will come and say, "You are not a child of God;
    <br>all ye that need bread, come to me - I have my bread".
    <br>Immediately he will come and say, "All ye that labour, you need bread, come to me.
    <br>I will give you bread. You are not His child, that is why He is not giving you but I will give you - come!"
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>I know everybody wants this.
    <br>This one is not 10 dollars - for your information.
    <br>If your faith is lifted up, let me see your hand.
    <br>You believe now that when you ask for something from God and you are not receiving
    <br>does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>I can't hear your voice.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>That you are sick and you are praying, fasting and you are not receiving healing
    <br>or any response from God does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Don't let satan talk to your heart.
    <br>Ninety nine percent that become unbelievers today - this is what satan uses.
    <br>He waits for any time you ask something from God and an answer is not coming,
    <br>he talks to your heart.
    <br>You will begin to look for charms, spiritualists, herbalists, alternatives; that is the work of satan.
    <br>You will begin to waver; you that go to church all the time, begin to, "I'm not going to church..."
    <br>The posh car you use to come to church all the time - suddenly the engine knocks.
    <br>At that moment, no money...
    <br>You ask yourself, "What have I done? I pay my tithes, I come to church regularly.
    <br>Why should this thing happen to me? What will I use to carry my family to church?"
    <br>That is the work of satan.
    <br>You are more of a Christian, that is why that attack comes.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You are more of God, that is why that attack comes.
    <br>Anything close to God receives attack.
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>If you are going too close - you begin to keep the commandments; too close to God,
    <br>satan is disturbed.
    <br>But when you begin to weaken in your relationship with God, satan will be laughing,
    <br>"That's good. He is coming back".
    <br>He will be blowing you with cool air, "Come back. Thank you".
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>When Jesus fasted 40 days 40 nights, that attack came.
    <br>Why did it not come when He was just coming from the mountain - why?
    <br>Why not when He was just coming from the mountain and He was fire.
    <br>The greatest temptation Jesus received was after 40 days 40 nights - that moment immediately.
    <br>Assume, He did not go for 40 days 40 nights - that temptation would have not come.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, when you are more of God, you should be ready.
    <br>If satan used cutlass, he will drop the cutlass and begin to use machine gun.
    <br>Because when he used cutlass to cut, you refused to be cut;
    <br>instead, you moved close to the Saviour - you need a machine gun.
    <br>You should draw strength from that weakness,
    <br>not weakness from weakness but strength from weakness.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Draw strength from weakness.
    <br>Paul Apostle said, "When I am weak, then I am strong".
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>I draw strength in my weakness.
    <br>As I am standing here, I am weak but the strength is beside me,
    <br>before me, behind me, always.
    <br>When I move, though I am weak, the strength follows me.
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>I am inside, like a cage.
    <br>Around me is strength but me, I am weak.
    <br>When I do like this, I rest on the strength.
    <br>'Emmanuel' means, 'God is with me'.
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>If God be with you...
    <br>Why do you need God to be with you? - Because you are weak.
    <br>Why do you need God to be before you? - Because you are weak.
    <br>Why do you need God to be beside you? - Because you are weak.
    <br>If you are not weak, you do not need anything to be with you.
    <br>He would have left you alone to walk on your own.
    <br>Because you are weak, He will be with you, before you, after you, behind you.
    <br>He is with you because you are weak.
    <br>Heavenly Currency | Sermon | T.B. Joshua
    <br>You are my strength when I am weak
    <br>You are the Treasure that I seek
    <br>You are my all in all
    <br>Seeking You as a precious jewel
    <br>Lord to give up I'd be a fool
    <br>You are my all in all
    <br>Jesus Lamb of God
    <br>Worthy is Your Name
    <br>Jesus Lamb of God
    <br>Worthy is Your Name
    <br>You are my strength when I am weak
    <br>You are the Treasure that I seek
    <br>You are my all in all
    <br>Seeking You as a precious jewel
    <br>Lord to give up I'd be a fool
    <br>You are my all in all
    <br>Jesus Lamb of God
    <br>Worthy is Your Name
    <br>Jesus Lamb of God
    <br>Worthy is Your Name
    <br>Believing is the only condition
    <br>For answered prayer
    <br>With my mouth I confess
    <br>With my heart I believe
    <br>I believe God's Word is true for my life
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>Help me overcome my unbelief
