  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to say thank you.
    <br>I salute your faith.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I really want to be one of you today
    <br>so the message I have for you, I will read it page by page
    <br>so that you can be able to write it down.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let me first of all say "thanks" to the following organisations and their support.
    <br>First, the state we are today – Lagos State and the Federal Government of Nigeria.
    <br>Thank you very much for your support and your prayer.
    <br>And the security agencies of different bodies -
    <br>I will not be able to mention you one by one, we have many security agencies around.
    <br>I want to salute you and thank you very much for your love and your prayer, and your support.
    <br>Let me also remember engineers and humanitarian groups with their equipment.
    <br>For some days now, I want to say thank you once again for your support.
    <br>Rescuers from different bodies – you just see people from everywhere.
    <br>Let me remember the doctors – what a wonderful people from all over... ,
    <br>not even Nigeria alone, but from everywhere and their hospitals too.
    <br>Media – I want to say "thank you" to the media
    <br>because I know the relationship of Jesus Christ with the media in the Bible.
    <br>Yes. Emmanuel TV is the media of Synagogue.
    <br>If we fight the media, we are fighting Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So, we want to salute you. Thank you very much.

    <br>Let me remember diplomatic missions all over the world.
    <br>We received letters from nearly all the embassies, praying and supporting us in prayer
    <br>and asking what they can do.
    <br>I want to say thank you diplomatic missions all the world - thank you very much.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank you.
    <br>There are many organizations I will not be able to mention.
    <br>If there is any organization I have not mentioned here,
    <br>I want to say thank you for your prayer and your love.
    <br>I want to start my message here.
    <br>I will just give you a detail because the security agencies need to do their job.
    <br>In a nutshell, let me start from the very day - that was Friday morning.
    <br>I was in the mountain.
    <br>I left there at exactly 8am in the morning and I received a phone call immediately.
    <br>After receiving a phone call, I immediately got here.
    <br>It was just a ten minutes interval.
    <br>When I was in the church, there was a jet hovering,
    <br>moving around at a very close range at the mountain which I had just left.
    <br>The place I left at the mountain, I received a phone call that there is a jet moving around that spot.
    <br>Well, I told them that I was in the church.
    <br>Before I knew it, I received a phone call again that there was a jet here,
    <br>the same jet here,
    <br>at the church, hovering around a building,
    <br>passing over the building four times at a very low range, before the building collapsed.
    <br>So, we are going to show you the video because the CCTV covered it.
    <br>OK, let's watch before I continue.
    <br>September 12, 2014. A building at the SCOAN collapses after a strange aircraft flies low,
    <br>multiple times over it before disappearing.
    <br>SCOAN visitors captured the strange aircraft on their camera at the entrance of the building.
    <br>A SCOAN visitor's photo – a strange aircraft flies low over a building at the SCOAN.
    <br>This is an enlarged view of the photograph taken.
    <br>It reveals the close proximity at which the strange aircraft flew over the building shortly before its collapse.
    <br>Let us listen to the visitors who took the photo, saw the aircraft and survived – September 12, 2014.
    <br>My name is Shadrack Mamzini. I am from South Africa.
    <br>We arrived here in September 11, 2014.
    <br>After the service in the main church, we went out for lunch.
    <br>When I was entering the other part of the church,
    <br>I wanted to take some pictures of the SCOAN buildings.
    <br>I took two pictures.
    <br>While I was taking the last picture, I discovered a very big aircraft.
    <br>It was something which was unusual in the way it looked.
    <br>It did not look like a passenger flight or an ordinary flight.
    <br>I asked myself what it was.
    <br>I thought maybe it was because the airport was close and the aircraft was going to land.
    <br>My worry was that it was too low to the building.
    <br>In South Africa, that kind of plane, such big aircrafts, don’t fly close to buildings.
    <br>I thought to myself that because the airport is close, the aircraft was trying to go and land.
    <br>There was a certain lady, who came into the canteen shouting and screaming,
    <br>crying that the building had collapsed.
    <br>It was when we went outside to see that, we saw it had collapsed.
    <br>I zoomed the picture where I saw the aircraft clearly on the picture.
    <br>This is a photograph taken by Mr Shadrack on his cell phone.
    <br>A look at the upper left-hand corner reveals the strange aircraft as it flew over the building.
    <br>By the time the incident happened, there were a lot of talks on it, that maybe the structure was poor.
    <br>Some said that the engineers were this and that.
    <br>It was until the man of God revealed what really happened,
    <br>I went back to check my photos, all the photos I had taken.
    <br>My name is Thobile Bhaku. I'm coming from South Africa.
    <br>When I entered the building, I heard the aircraft but I did not care about the aircraft.
    <br>I went inside the dining hall because it was lunch time.
    <br>On the queue, I was served.
    <br>While I was preparing coffee for myself, I heard a big sound behind me.
    <br>It was something like a big bang.
    <br>When I looked up, I saw the slab falling down.
    <br>Because of my experiences – I am a health and safety officer -
    <br>I have been trained on what to do.
    <br>When a beam is falling on top of you, you have to go opposite direction.
    <br>I ran to the opposite direction.
    <br>As I was running to the opposite direction, I saw the walls were cracking all over.
    <br>Suddenly, I was on the floor and it was dark, as if it was not during the day.
    <br>It was very, very hot and dark on the inside.
    <br>But in some cases, we could feel that there was fresh air coming in.
    <br>We did not know were the fresh air was coming from.
    <br>We prayed to God and thanked God.
    <br>We thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for praying for us.
    <br>All of us there, we are alive.
    <br>My name is Mick Milambo. I am from South Africa.
    <br>Originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
    <br>I was walking with my friend, Joseph.
    <br>He is not here; he went back to South Africa today.
    <br>At the time, we walked and had just crossed the gate here.
    <br>We saw the aircraft.
    <br>It was just passing here, slowly – a big aircraft.
    <br>My friend told me, "If you see an aircraft like this, it is trouble".
    <br>The sound was not that big; it was small and it was a big aircraft.
    <br>But it was passing, not far but slowly.
    <br>After that, we went into the same building the aircraft had passed over.
    <br>That was the same building we were going to.
    <br>Our lunch was supposed to be taken there.
    <br>After that, they started serving lunch.
    <br>We managed to get our lunch.
    <br>I can say about after ten minutes, I heard just a sound.
    <br>You know, it was like glass, when you break glass.
    <br>We were just here; the wall was behind us.
    <br>We just turned to look at what had happened and we saw this thing was coming to us, fast.
    <br>It was very fast.
    <br>That was the sound.
    <br>Everyone was down.
    <br>We started calling each other.
    <br>Amazingly, everyone was alive.
    <br>We communicated with everyone.
    <br>We started praying.
    <br>God is great; we didn’t cease to shout the name of Jesus down there.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Here speaks Charles Thawane from Johannesburg, South Africa.
    <br>On Friday, we were in the church.
    <br>At lunch time, we went out and were moving to where they were serving.
    <br>Where we were going was next to the building that later fell.
    <br>I saw the aircraft was going to the building
    <br>but I was with my friend and he was just taking photos of the SCOAN buildings.
    <br>That aircraft, when it came, I did not think it would come to the building
    <br>because it was coming as if it was going to pass the building
    <br>but suddenly when we saw it on the photo, it was turning to the building.
    <br>It was big.
    <br>It was big but it was not having sound too much.
    <br>The sound was not too much because if it was too much, I think everybody was going to look up.
    <br>It was a silent one when it was moving.
    <br>It was moving very slowly.
    <br>It looked like a jet.
    <br>It didn’t look like an ordinary plane that you take when you go somewhere.
    <br>After that, we passed the building.
    <br>We were going to where we were going to eat.
    <br>Then, my friend was still taking those photos.
    <br>That was what I had seen and then, that was it.
    <br>What I would like to confirm is what people saw on Emmanuel TV, the clip the man of God showed.
    <br>Some say it looks like a bird; it is not an aircraft.
    <br>But I would like to confirm it, that it was an aircraft.
    <br>We saw it; we witnessed it.
    <br>We thank God because on one of the pictures taken, the aircraft was captured.
    <br>I would like to believe it was the plan of God that pushed that excitement to take those pictures.
    <br>It was the Holy Spirit. Thank you very much.
    <br>Security footage September 12, 2014.
    <br>A strange aircraft flies low over a building at The SCOAN multiple times before the incident
    <br>and after the incident, the strange aircraft does not return.
    <br>September 12, 2014
    <br>Take note of the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
    <br>A strange aircraft flies over the building of The SCOAN before the incident at 11:30am.
    <br>Thirteen minutes later, the strange aircraft flies low over the building before the incident - 11:43am.
    <br>Just two minutes later, the strange aircraft returns and flies lower over the buildings
    <br>before the incident - 11:45am.
    <br>Nine minutes later, the strange aircraft returns and again flies low over the building
    <br>before the incident -  11:54am.
    <br>This is the moment of the incident.
    <br>After the incident, the strange aircraft does not return.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Let me continue my message.
    <br>After the fourth time, we could not see the aircraft again.
    <br>Let me read a little message for you before I bring out some details.
    <br>In this environment of Ikotun-Egbe, we have never witnessed an accident of a building collapse.
    <br>This is to tell you that we have a stable terrain in Ikotun-Egbe.
    <br>I have been in this community for the past 30 years
    <br>and there has been no record of a building collapse.
    <br>As a minister of the Gospel, our first priority is life saving.
    <br>There is no compromise in what we do at all.
    <br>I am going to leave this for you to judge.
    <br>Take note of that – I am pregnant of the word.
    <br>We have left the security to do their job.
    <br>Let us believe - take note of that - and educate our people and be alert.
    <br>Why we should believe -
    <br>so that our country will not witness a similar incident in another place.
    <br>This is not the first time.
    <br>If we believe, we will educate our people and be alert.
    <br>No matter how long a lie is sustained, the truth will some day prevail.
    <br>We should remember the militant who came with his group to this church with a bomb and he was arrested.
    <br>It was televised. Upon televising it and showing it on the screen,
    <br>all groups were saying it was a lie -
    <br>but later they discovered that it was true
    <br>because they felt their presence somewhere.
    <br>The case of the militant is still with the security.
    <br>The press men, the news all over the world said the story was false.
    <br>I know you will ask me, “Why Synagogue?”
    <br>That is the question that is going through you, “Why this church?”
    <br>Yes. Don’t forget the spiritual blessing that God has bestowed on us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A big head wears a large hat.
    <br>Don’t forget the ebola issue.
    <br>It was God who rescued this ministry from the issue.
    <br>They want to put the issue of ebola.
    <br>If possible, they would have taken an ebola patient and dropped it into the church.
    <br>You remember the text message you received: "Ebola is in the church - don't go there".
    <br>Cook hot water, put salt. Say: "T.B. Joshua".
    <br>You have forgotten? Don't forget.
    <br>God rescued this ministry from that.
    <br>They were trying to scare you from coming to this church.
    <br>Don’t be scared – you are not the target; I am the target.
    <br>I know my hour has not yet come.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Don’t be scared – you are not the target; I am the target
    <br>and my hour has not yet come.
    <br>I have not yet finished my job.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have not finished my job.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>Don’t forget the message you have been receiving for the past two weeks.
    <br>I was talking to you in parables.
    <br>Go over the messages – you will see the picture.
    <br>When a situation like this comes, you should know how to handle it.
    <br>It has come and God is on top of the matter.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me remind you of what I said during last Sunday service:
    <br>that what would be happening between now would be much much greater than 10 years.
    <br>How many of you were in the service?
    <br>I want to assure you that our God will get back to them.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>God will get back to them – the agents of satan, and you will know when He gets back to them.
    <br>You will know.
    <br>And I'm happy that the whole thing starts here.
    <br>I will tell you the reason why I say, "The whole thing starts here".
    <br>From the beginning, it has been a battle.
    <br>If you notice, I have been talking to you for the past two weeks in parables.
    <br>I want to show you some documents here.
    <br>These documents - I think my wife just sees them now for the first time.
    <br>Only those who received it from the email department and I.
    <br>Those who received those documents, I warned them: between me and you and God.
    <br>Nobody should see these documents.
    <br>But because of what has happened, I think - I will just show you one.
    <br>Just one.
    <br>I want somebody to come out and read this document.
    <br>With the picture.
    <br>"Man of God - my name is Emmanuel Anaja. I am from Kogi state, living in Jos,
    <br>right now with my parent, who is a soldier.
    <br>I have a confession to make.
    <br>I want to give my life to Jesus Christ, our Saviour.
    <br>I am a Boko Haram member.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN to plant a bomb in the Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>but I could not do it because of God, who called you.
    <br>I went back to Jos with the bomb, which I still have with me.
    <br>Now, I want to show the whole world the God you serve.
    <br>Man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua - please talk to God for me, for the Bible says:
    <br>"Confess your sins to one another."
    <br>This is the picture of the man.
    <br>For security reasons, I think, I will not give you more than that.
    <br>This is one out of thousands.
    <br>The reason I am showing you this - for you to know the God you are serving.
    <br>God wants to reveal to you what He has been doing that you don’t know.
    <br>Probably, we may not appreciate what He has been doing.
    <br>And I know that because of what I have shown you, those who are faithless may not come here again.
    <br>If I had shown it in the past, the faithless generation might have not wanted to come.
    <br>It is not only one, two, or three.
    <br>I have picked them and I reported them to the security.
    <br>Do you know what it means for the church, you trust in so much, to show something on the screen?
    <br>You must confirm that it is true.
    <br>Because it is not normal to show something which is not true - on the screen.
    <br>I was showing it for good two months, still you were saying that it was not true.
    <br>Not until you saw their presence somewhere.
    <br>What happened – we should believe it so that we can educate our people to be alert.
    <br>If not...
    <br>I said it last time, concerning Boko Haram, what you are seeing now is not going to stop here,
    <br>but our God will get back. Maybe this will be the end of the whole thing.
    <br>I want to salute the martyrs, our people who are so faithful to God -
    <br>God’s Generals – people who know the God they are serving -
    <br>I want to salute them.
    <br>Thank you, all over the world.
    <br>I want to say,
    <br>the story we read for the past three days -
    <br>you know, I remained silent - I had to,
    <br>because I know...
    <br>My life has been like that.
    <br>Right from the beginning of my life, people were lying, but they would still come back to the truth.
    <br>My life has been like that.
    <br>And that is a good life, for people to lie against you first, before they realize the truth.
    <br>If people had realized the truth at the beginning, the story might have not started,
    <br>because there is "sorry" all over...
    <br>Here I am – I leave you for you to judge.
    <br>I am a prophet. Security has a job to do.
    <br>Thank you very much.
