  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>(Good morning.)
    <br>Viewers, good morning to you all.
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I see the need of coming out to wish you Merry Christmas in advance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The year is coming to an end.
    <br>The sooner the better - we begin to remind ourselves what we need to do, preparing for the new year.
    <br>Once again - Happy New Year in advance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's quickly go to our Holy Bible and see one of the messages the Lord prepared for us for the coming year.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Take your reading: 1 Corinthians 13.
    <br>Thank you - let's take our reading about love here.
    <br>1 Corinthians 12:31: "Love is Indispensable
    <br>...And yet I will show you the most excellent way."
    <br>The most excellent way to enjoy your life.
    <br>THE BEAUTY OF LIFE
    <br>If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love,
    <br>I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
    <br>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
    <br>and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
    <br>If I give all I possess to the poor and give my body to hardship...
    <br>Many of us fast and pray in hardship - you say, "In the name of Jesus" - listen what the Bible says here:
    <br>... that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
    <br>We fast, we pray but it seems that nothing comes.
    <br>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast - that is love.
    <br>It is not proud, arrogant.
    <br>It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking - that is love.
    <br>It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
    <br>Past is past.
    <br>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
    <br>It puts everything behind - that is love.
    <br>‘Let love lead’, that is our motto.
    <br>I know many of you have the sticker.
    <br>You have it, don't you?
    <br>Let love lead.
    <br>Let's quickly have a look at 1 Corinthians 13:13:
    <br>"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."
    <br>Let someone say, "Let love lead".
    <br>(Let love lead.)
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If love is the greatest, you should let it lead you everywhere, day by day – love.
    <br>Most of us here, we always wait until people are crying for help before we can help.
    <br>What the Bible was saying about our attitude towards love, the way and manner we show love?
    <br>People crying for help before you can help.
    <br>We remain indifferent until people say, “Please, help me!”
    <br>We see them lamenting and crying before we say, “Come”.
    <br>That is not love.
    <br>Such love cannot attract God’s attention.
    <br>"Uncle, please help me..."
    <br>Where were you looking, before someone came asking, "Help me, uncle"?
    <br>You must have seen him in one way or another.
    <br>That is not love that attracts God's attention.
    <br>What we give or what we do is not as important as the manner and way in which we do it.
    <br>What you give me is not as important as the manner and way you give me.
    <br>The manner and way you give me attracts God’s attention.
    <br>It is not what you give that attracts God’s attention.
    <br>It is not the millions you are giving; it is not all your possessions you give
    <br>but the manner and way you give them that attracts God’s attention.
    <br>When you give to someone in a way that pleases God, someone is waiting to give you too.
    <br>When you give to someone in a way that pleases God, someone will be waiting also to give you too.
    <br>You have been giving all this...
    <br>If you do not give in a way and manner that pleases God, you are just wasting your effort and time.
    <br>It is not what we give that matters but the manner and way we give them.
    <br>Look at you: you are sitting in the church today.
    <br>If there was an issue of big importance to address, who knows if you would be here.
    <br>The way you do things attracts God’s attention; it is not what you do.
    <br>Who knows – if you received a phone call now:
    <br>“Hello” – oh this is my excellency, my president,
    <br>this is a million dollar opportunity - who knows if you wouldn't escape the church?
    <br>The manner and the way we do things and give things matters.
    <br>God is not one of those things – He is the only thing.
    <br>The beauty of life does not depend on how happy you are
    <br>but on how happy others can be because of you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How many people are happy because of you today?
    <br>How many lives have you touched?
    <br>Somebody needs something you possess.
    <br>It may be your love, smile – a genuine one,
    <br>it may be your money, strength, time.
    <br>You talk of salvation?
    <br>Look at the whole world.
    <br>80% of the world is crying - hardship in your place, poverty, orphans which were supposed to go to school -
    <br>and you are telling me that you are saved.
    <br>Someone is in need of you.
    <br>No matter how little you have.
    <br>You say you are saved, born again - but see the people on the streets, at your place.
    <br>Your children are in the school, but the children of your neighbor are on the street and you turn your head away.
    <br>And you say you are saved - salvation.
    <br>How do we define salvation?
    <br>You may say you are poor; you may be surprised to see someone who is poorer than you are.
    <br>In life, there are always greater and lesser people than you.
    <br>Let us see the help of the widow, needy, poor, refugee as a priority over any other help.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you help them, you sow to the Spirit.
    <br>You are a spirit being.
    <br>The real thing about you is not your body.
    <br>In John 8:36, Jesus said, ‘If the Son sets you free, you are free indeed’.
    <br>He meant the liberation of the spirit man.
    <br>He meant the liberation of what?
    <br>Spirit man.
    <br>A man is a spirit being.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, ‘You are a spirit being’.
    <br>(You are a spirit being.)
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(You are a spirit being.)
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(You are a spirit being.)
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(You are a spirit being.)
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's sow to the Spirit.
    <br>For those of us who are saying, ‘I am poor. I have little’,
    <br>if you cannot part with little, you will not be able to part with much.
    <br>Our idea of "if only" keeps robbing us of our blessings.
    <br>If only I had money I would help the poor, 
    <br>if only I had enough money I would build an orphanage.
    <br>The danger here is:
    <br>if you fail to help with the little God has blessed you with, more may never come.
    <br>The danger here is, if you fail to bless, help people with the little God blessed you with,
    <br>more may never come.
    <br>That is the measure.
    <br>The way and manner you manage little possessions or money,
    <br>will make God decide whether to promote you or not.
    <br>How do you manage your little possessions?
    <br>Everyone claims to have little.
    <br>THE BEAUTY OF LIFE
    <br>Don’t forget, your possessions alone cannot give you contentment -
    <br>that is why we are running helter-skelter -
    <br>but giving help to the needy, to the poor can.
    <br>Happy New Year in advance.
    <br>This is the way, the road to the New Year.
    <br>Ask Zacchaeus in Luke 19:9
    <br>and he would tell you that when he decided to give cheerfully and genuinely to the poor,
    <br>Jesus recommended him and said to him that salvation had come to his household.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The word salvation means contentment.
    <br>Are you content?
    <br>Salvation means what?
    <br>Are you content?
    <br>It means you are not saved.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I define again: salvation means contentment - to be content.
    <br>What others are doing -
    <br>I am what God says I am, I have what God says I have and I can do what God says I can do.
    <br>That is the meaning of contentment.
    <br>Are you content?
    <br>You always measure, compare yourself to others.
    <br>That is not contentment.
    <br>Envy, jealousy...
    <br>A road to the new year.
    <br>I want to take you back again in summary.
    <br>Love is the greatest weapon – let love lead.
    <br>What you are giving is not as important as the way and manner in which you give them.
    <br>Tell me - when you have given something to a neighbour and said, "Thank you for receiving my gift"...
    <br>When somebody receives your gift, it is reshaping your destiny.
    <br>It's helping you.
    <br>You are not helping the person you give but the person that receives your gift is helping you.
    <br>Today, you believe the person you are giving is the one you are helping and he should thank you.
    <br>Rather, you should thank him for receiving your gift.
    <br>When you give, you are reshaping your destiny.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>With all your heart, give what is pure, what is good, what is just, what is admirable.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why your millions don't give you peace.
    <br>You are supposed to realise peace and comfort but yet, no peace, no comfort
    <br>upon your possessions and money because you have not been giving
    <br>to the poor, needy, refugees, widows and orphans in a manner and way that pleases God.
    <br>When you give with all your heart, someone is waiting to give to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I remind you about tithes, offerings - I am not supposed to say it.
    <br>If I say and you give me, it will not bless me, because you are not giving this from your heart.
    <br>It is not something they should inform or remind me about.
    <br>It should come from your heart.
    <br>There is no forcing in it.
    <br>It is a blessing.
    <br>We don’t force people to bless; blessing comes naturally.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are not giving to the needy with all your heart, you are just wasting your time.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let the Spirit convince you.
    <br>Happy New Year in advance.
    <br>If you have two shirts, give one to the poor.
    <br>If you have food, share with those who are hungry.
    <br>Go into your wardrobe, go into your cupboard, go into your store
    <br>and see the need to give to the needy and the poor.
    <br>Your life will not remain the same.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to see you going to the bank, withdrawing the money and giving it to the poor.
    <br>THE BEAUTY OF LIFE
    <br>Don't wait for the reward after giving.
    <br>It is better they don't know you.
    <br>If they know you, don’t pose yourself as a giver. Jesus is the Giver.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am giving you the picture of my life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your labour of love without cheerful and sincere giving cannot help you.
    <br>Let us be sincere to ourselves; stop giving only what you do not need.
    <br>Give also what you need.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If God had been giving you what you do not need, would you be blessed?
    <br>You give what you do not need.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stop giving only what you do not need".
    <br>(Stop giving only what you do not need.)
    <br>Giving is a sacrifice.
    <br>If you give what you do not need, that is not sacrifice.
    <br>Sacrifice means pain in one way or the other.
    <br>You feel it, you must feel it...
    <br>Look at the time you come here.
    <br>It seems to apply to many of us here.
    <br>Time you don't actually need - there is nothing to do out there: no job, no game, nothing -
    <br>"What would I do at home? Let me go to church."
    <br>You should commit not only the time you don't need.
    <br>You should be part of your church - not only attending the Sunday service.
    <br>You should ask, "What can I do? Look at the church - it is very clean. Who cleaned it?
    <br>Will I just come and sit? No! I must join the department".
    <br>Once a week - find a day to help the department in what they do.
    <br>Join an evangelical department - it is your home.
    <br>Money, money, money - no!
    <br>Money cannot bring contentment but giving it to help the poor can.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, New Year is coming.
    <br>There is no other way to prepare for the New Year.
    <br>The best way is to allow love to lead.
    <br>If love must lead you, you must consider the way and manner you do things,
    <br>the way and manner you give things,
    <br>the way and manner you sleep,
    <br>the way and manner you sit,
    <br>the way and manner you look,
    <br>the way and manner you dress,
    <br>the way and manner you walk,
    <br>the way and manner you greet,
    <br>the way and manner you do things you must consider – that is love.
    <br>In a manner that pleases God, that is what we call love.
    <br>Not to just give, help - but the manner you help, give or greet.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up, let’s lift up our voice to God, to help us serve Him with all our talent
    <br>because we have not been serving God with all our talent.
    <br>The manner and way we serve God with our talent, our love is not pleasing to Him.
    <br>Open your lips, ask God, “Help me to serve You with all my talent – my labour of love”.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>I want to serve You Lord with all my talent!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are here today - this is not your quality time that you give to God.
    <br>Many of you will come here next Sunday again.
    <br>That's all.
    <br>That is the way you serve God.
    <br>Ask Him, "Lord, Your grace in this coming year."
    <br>You have to prepare now for the New Year.
    <br>This is the way to prepare.
    <br>You have to realise your mistakes - this is what you need to do right, now.
    <br>My talent, my gift - about people, about God.
    <br>Ask Him, "Lord Jesus, give me the grace to serve You with all my talent, my love, my time.”
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>You need grace.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Ask Him, ”Help cleanse all my wrongs in action and thoughts, knowingly and unknowingly”.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
