  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>How is your faith?
    <br>We believe your faith is getting stronger and stronger!
    <br>Now, I have a very simple question that I want to ask you today.
    <br>Very simple and I'm sure you will be able to provide a quick answer.
    <br>If you are driving a car and your car gets damaged -
    <br>maybe the engine fails or there is a problem, it gets damaged - what are you going to do?
    <br>Anyone just has the answer for me.
    <br>If your car gets damaged, what are you going to do?
    <br>Ok, our brother here can answer the question.
    <br>You will go to the mechanic.
    <br>Ok, is that the right answer?
    <br>You are not sure - it is the right answer.
    <br>He said you will go to the mechanic; that is correct.
    <br>Why? Because the car needs to be repaired.
    <br>You need to go to someone that is smarter and wiser than you
    <br>in the area of cars to be able to repair it.
    <br>Ok, now if your mobile phone - I know everyone has a handset here -
    <br>if your mobile phone, if you damage it - maybe you dropped it -
    <br>I don't know if anyone has dropped his phone before
    <br>and the screen just cracks - very painful.
    <br>The screen just cracks - what are you going to do?
    <br>You will take it to the repair shop
    <br>because you realise you need someone with that knowledge
    <br>to be able to repair your phone.
    <br>Ok now, just imagine, God forbids, something happens,
    <br>you have an accident and break a bone.
    <br>Your bone is broken - what do you need to do?
    <br>You will go to the hospital so that they can fix the broken bone, to repair the damage.
    <br>Now, let me ask you this question.
    <br>If your heart is damaged, where do you go?
    <br>I'm not hearing you very well.
    <br>Remember, I am not talking about the heart that the dictionary defines -
    <br>that pumps the blood through your body -
    <br>I am referring to the spiritual man, inner man, the man himself.
    <br>If your heart is damaged, you must go to the Owner of your heart to repair it.
    <br>Who is the Owner of your heart?
    <br>I want to tell you today:
    <br>If you are ready to be repaired, Jesus is ready to repair you.
    <br>I will repeat it once again.
    <br>If you are ready, willing to be repaired, Jesus is willing to repair you today.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>Salvation is not in us; we cannot save ourselves, we destroy ourselves.
    <br>We need Someone who is stronger, wiser, smarter, bigger, greater, cleverer, more than us - Jesus.
    <br>That is why we are here today; I believe that is why you are here.
    <br>Now, let me ask you this question:
    <br>If you are here today for repair,
    <br>why would anyone intentionally inflict damage on themselves?
    <br>Let me repeat the question again.
    <br>If you are here today to be repaired, restored
    <br>because Jesus Christ is the Repairer and Restorer,
    <br>why would anyone intentionally inflict damage on themselves?
    <br>This will bring us to the title of today's message:
    <br>DAMAGE CONTROL.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of John 10 from verse 10.
    <br>This is a very well-known Scripture, let me quickly read it for you.
    <br>John 10:10.
    <br>It reads thus:
    <br>"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy;
    <br>I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full."
    <br>People of God, never confuse these two:
    <br>satan comes to steal, kill and destroy
    <br>but Jesus Christ comes to give life, and life in abundance.
    <br>In other words, satan comes to damage; Jesus comes to restore.
    <br>You have an opportunity as you are here in the presence of God today
    <br>to reflect on your life and check yourself.
    <br>Nobody knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>If your heart is damaged, you can know.
    <br>Why? Because something is destroying your peace,
    <br>killing your joy, interfering, interrupting your calmness.
    <br>You can know if something is affecting, damaging your heart.
    <br>How does one's heart get damaged?
    <br>How does satan access our heart to inflict damage?
    <br>What is the easiest route, the most common method that he uses to penetrate our hearts?
    <br>The answer is always in the Word of God.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Ephesians 4.
    <br>I'm going to read from verse 26 and pick a few verses here.
    <br>It says, " 'In your anger do not sin': Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,
    <br>and do not give the devil a foothold."
    <br>Now quickly skip down to verse 31.
    <br>"Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander,
    <br>along with every form of malice.
    <br>Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other,
    <br>just as in Christ God forgave you."
    <br>Now quickly turn to Galatians - the Book just before Galatians 5
    <br>and we are going to read another Scripture that answers this question.
    <br>Galatians 5 - I am going to read the verses 14 to 15.
    <br>It says thus:
    <br>"For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbour as yourself.'
    <br>If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other."
    <br>We may not have time to read more Scriptures but I also want you to read
    <br>the Book of Luke 6:29 and Matthew 5:25.
    <br>In that Luke 6:29, that is where Jesus said:
    <br>'If you are slapped on the one cheek, turn the other cheek.'
    <br>In Matthew 5:25 that is where Jesus, speaking in the sermon on the mount, said that
    <br>'If you have a quarrel with your adversary, settle your differences quickly.'
    <br>Now the summary of all these Scriptures is very simple.
    <br>Do not hold onto offence because nursing a grudge damages your heart.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>whether you are right or wrong, don't hold onto offence
    <br>because nursing a grudge damages your heart."
    <br>Nursing bitterness, resentment, revenge, pain of the past,
    <br>bad feelings towards others damages your heart.
    <br>When you become offended, you are satan's captive; your heart becomes the devil's workshop
    <br>where he can begin to manufacture other fruits of darkness.
    <br>When you are offended, you can easily slip into anger, malice,
    <br>easily find yourself getting jealous, talking negatively about others
    <br>because your heart at that moment is the devil's workshop.
    <br>How long you harbour offence is how long your heart is for satan.
    <br>People of God, let me give you a very simple illustration.
    <br>Harbouring offence is a self-inflicted wound.
    <br>You are here today for Jesus to repair you
    <br>but if you are harbouring offence, you are doing greater damage to yourself.
    <br>It is like you are hitting yourself.
    <br>Let me do that again so you can see it very well.
    <br>Any time you hold offence, just imagine it like this:
    <br>When you are holding offence, this is what you are doing...
    <br>"How can she treat me like this? After all I have done for her!"
    <br>You are damaging yourself.
    <br>"We have been together for so many years and she disappointed me. How can this happen?"
    <br>You are hitting yourself, you are damaging yourself,
    <br>you are inflicting pain on yourself.
    <br>But you say, "Brother Chris, you don't know what this lady has done to me.
    <br>She caused me so much pain. She really pained me".
    <br>I agree. Some situations are painful.
    <br>But when you harbour a grudge, you are adding pain to the pain.
    <br>You say, "Brother, you don't know the hurt in my heart.
    <br>This person hurt me so deeply, I can never forgive them".
    <br>I'm not acknowledging that it did not hurt.
    <br>Yes, it may have hurt.
    <br>But when you harbour offence, you are adding hurt to the hurt.
    <br>How then will you get repaired?
    <br>How then can Jesus repair and restore you
    <br>when you have put yourself in a cage - self-imprisonment?
    <br>Let me just do a very quick example to illustrate this.
    <br>Can I have five gentlemen.
    <br>Anywhere you are, if God puts it in your heart, just five gentlemen.
    <br>Ok, number one - come out.
    <br>Number two, number three.
    <br>From this side, number four.
    <br>Number five. Ok, thank you very much.
    <br>It is a very simple example to illustrate the danger of offence.
    <br>Our brother here, just turn this way, sir.
    <br>Our brother here represents me and you - all of us who are here today,
    <br>coming to church with our issues, our challenges,
    <br>we need Jesus to repair us, the damage that has been done in different areas of our lives.
    <br>Our brother here - very simple, you are going to represent offence.
    <br>Just turn and stand like this.
    <br>Our brother here - just come and stand like this, the other way round.
    <br>You are going to represent resentment.
    <br>My brother here, come.
    <br>You are representing grudge. Just face the other way.
    <br>And lastly my father here.
    <br>You are representing bitterness.
    <br>Now, the four of you, I want you to lock arms.
    <br>Just lock arms, still facing this way round.
    <br>Just hold your arms together; the four of you.
    <br>Great. Now, whatever happens, don't let this guy go.
    <br>Ok, this is your assignment.
    <br>This is your assignment right now: Whatever happens, don't let this man go.
    <br>No matter how many prayers he prays, no matter how many songs he sings,
    <br>no matter how much offering he drops, don't let him go because this is self-imprisonment.
    <br>Now, I want to give you an example.
    <br>Our brother here represents me and you.
    <br>So many of us are here in the church today asking God to release us
    <br>but we have not released ourselves.
    <br>We are asking for the Restorer to restore us, the Repairer to repair us, the Reviver to revive us
    <br>but we are in prison - we are holding someone hostage of unforgiveness.
    <br>Remember, the person most hurt by unforgiveness is you.
    <br>When you cannot forgive, you hurt yourself more than anyone;
    <br>you destroy yourself and your future.
    <br>When you cannot forgive, any step you take, you take in darkness.
    <br>And our brother here is in the church, "God, have mercy on me..
    <br>God, touch my business. God, I'm looking for promotion"
    <br>but there is a wall around him, a fence around him.
    <br>Let me tell you something, brethren.
    <br>So many of us here today are looking for promotion.
    <br>I want to tell you, promotion is looking for you
    <br>but don't say, 'Amen' too quickly.
    <br>Promotion is looking for you but it cannot reach you because you are in prison.
    <br>It is available; it is on the table.
    <br>Deliverance is looking for you, breakthrough is looking for you
    <br>but it cannot access you because you are in prison.
    <br>You say you are here looking for breakthrough - no, breakthrough is looking for you
    <br>but the avenue that breakthrough will come through has been blocked.
    <br>There is a barrier, there is a cage, there is a wall,
    <br>there is a fence that is not allowing the promotion to reach through
    <br>that is not allowing the breakthrough to come through,
    <br>that is not allowing the healing to reach through.
    <br>No amount of physical strength can break this barrier of offence,
    <br>resentment, bitterness, pain of the past.
    <br>No amount of mental strength, no amount of connections,
    <br>no amount of money can break this barrier.
    <br>Only one thing can break this barrier:
    <br>forgiveness.
    <br>Forgiveness will break down that barrier.
    <br>Now, I am going to try this again.
    <br>This time, sir, when you say, "Forgiveness", our gentlemen here are going to
    <br>clear the way and let our brother free.
    <br>What can set you free in this circumstance?
    <br>Forgiveness!
    <br>Now, he can come - come and take your promotion,
    <br>come and take your freedom - no, not too many.
    <br>Wow, two are okay.
    <br>You can come and take them because there is nothing blocking you,
    <br>there is nothing hindering you.
    <br>People of God, you will receive in a moment what you have been seeking for years
    <br>the moment you let go of offence.
    <br>Just let go and let God bless you.
    <br>My brothers, before you go, just quickly come back here.
    <br>Help me stand in a row.
    <br>I just want us to talk to ourselves because we all know what is happening in our society
    <br>and we all know what is happening in our lives.
    <br>Like I said at the beginning: You know yourself.
    <br>Nobody knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>You know what is damaging your heart, interfering with your joy,
    <br>your peace, your calmness.
    <br>- My brother, what is your name?
    <br>- Victor.
    <br>I want to ask you a very simple question: Are you a perfect person?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- Sir, are you a perfect person?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Sir, are you a perfect person?
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>- Are you a perfect person?
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>- Are you a perfect person?
    <br>- No.
    <br>We are living in a world where there is no such thing as a perfect relationship.
    <br>Why then do you see an imperfect person, moving with an imperfect person
    <br>and you expect perfect results?
    <br>Not in this world.
    <br>Why am I saying this? Because it is common today, it is common among us
    <br>when someone offends us, you see the way people react -
    <br>people are shocked, surprised, bewildered
    <br>as if they are the only ones in this world that have been wronged,
    <br>as if no one else in this world has been wronged,
    <br>as if they themselves have never wronged anyone.
    <br>"How can this happen to me? After all I have done.
    <br>Don't you know what I'm doing in the church,
    <br>don't you know the good works I have been doing.
    <br>They repair me with evil, what is the meaning of this?" -
    <br>as if you are the only one in this world that has been wronged.
    <br>People of God, everyone has been wronged and everyone gets it wrong.
    <br>That is the reason why forgiveness is so important
    <br>because there is no such thing as a perfect relationship.
    <br>What is happening today - today, when you insult me, I take offence,
    <br>"How can he insult me" but I insult others.
    <br>When you embarrass me, "How can you embarrass me? What is the meaning of this?" -
    <br>you take offence but you embarrass others.
    <br>"You lied against me; how can you lie against me?" -
    <br>but you, if you check yourself, you have lied against others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>I have no grounds to hold offence against you.
    <br>You have no grounds to hold offence against me.
    <br>Settle your differences quickly".
    <br>Damage control.
    <br>People of God, thank you very much for being of use to this example.
    <br>Come and take your promotion before you go.
    <br>Those that have not taken, come and take your promotion,
    <br>now that the barrier has been removed. Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I hope you are understanding, people of God, what I'm talking about.
    <br>We are here in the church asking for the help of God
    <br>but oftentimes we are the ones inflicting damage on ourselves.
    <br>This is the reason why, in that Book of Hebrews -
    <br>let me quickly turn there for you.
    <br>The Book of Hebrews 12:14.
    <br>It very simply says this:
    <br>"Pursue peace with all people..."
    <br>You can also read Romans 12:18 which says:
    <br>"As far as it is possible, as much as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone."
    <br>Because nursing a grudge, harbouring offence simply damages your own heart.
    <br>You are inflicting pain upon yourself.
    <br>The example I just gave there was regular relationship
    <br>in terms of our workplace, family, business,
    <br>these relationships we have, there is no such thing as a perfect person.
    <br>There is another point I want to illustrate as well.
    <br>As a Christian, you must understand that we are in this world but we are not part of them.
    <br>And anything close to Jesus, anything close to what is right will definitely receive attack.
    <br>Many people have been serving the Lord fervently and they have been misjudged
    <br>or mistreated by wicked men or religious people.
    <br>It is easy in that situation to begin to ask, "Why me of all this persecution?
    <br>I'm doing the right thing. Why should I get the wrong results?
    <br>Why should people insult me for no cause?
    <br>Why should p eople embarrass me unjustly?
    <br>Why should I face this kind of vilification at my work place? Why?"
    <br>It is easy to have this kind of response, "Why me?"
    <br>If you don't want persecution, you don't want progress.
    <br>If you don't want hatred, then you don't want success
    <br>because progress in life makes you a mark for satan to shoot at.
    <br>And the blessings of God attract persecution, they attract hatred, they attract intimidation.
    <br>I'm not saying this to make you worried, afraid or concerned.
    <br>No, God is there to see us through.
    <br>We have to understand that when we are mistreated, when we are misjudged,
    <br>if we hold offence, we have simply fulfilled the purpose of our enemy
    <br>to get us out of the will of God.
    <br>Our enemy does not want us to be close to God.
    <br>Our enemy wants to damage our relationship with God.
    <br>Our enemy wants to damage our hearts.
    <br>When you hold offence, when you become offended, when people misjudge you
    <br>or mistreat you or treat you harshly or wrongly, you have simply fulfilled his purpose
    <br>to take you out of the will of God,
    <br>whereas any true Christian knows that persecution is a tonic to our anointing.
    <br>The persecution we suffer in the hands of our detractors causes us to be known
    <br>all over the world.
    <br>Let me give you a very simple example.
    <br>Everyone here is a testimony to this.
    <br>You look at the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We all know the persecution that has been levelled against him
    <br>from the very beginning of his ministry.
    <br>Let me take, for example, his recent visit to Nazareth.
    <br>I'm sure we watched the glorious events on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>some of us might have even been privileged to have gone there physically.
    <br>We saw the wonderful events in Nazareth, the home town of Jesus Christ.
    <br>If you monitored the events, you would have seen that before the Nazareth Meeting,
    <br>there was a lot of noise everywhere.
    <br>I know, I was one of the people that was physically there before Prophet T.B. Joshua arrived.
    <br>A lot of noise.
    <br>People spread misinformation.
    <br>Religious people started to misjudge our motives.
    <br>They thought we were coming there to try to force people to convert.
    <br>They thought we were coming there with a political message.
    <br>They thought we were coming there with the aim to make money.
    <br>There were protests, people said they were going to boycott the event.
    <br>People said nobody would attend the event.
    <br>There was a lot of noise.
    <br>I remember I called Prophet T.B. Joshua on the phone when I was there
    <br>and I said, "Sir, I don't know if this event is still going to hold.
    <br>The noise is too much.
    <br>There is a lot of persecution, a lot of attack.
    <br>I'm not even sure people are going to turn up".
    <br>You know what he said? He said this, "The crusade has already happened.
    <br>Nothing can stop it. It is written".
    <br>Do you know today, the persecution, the attack that they thought would stop the event
    <br>ended up promoting the event.
    <br>Their persecution became our publicity - free publicity, free adverts.
    <br>The whole nation knew that someone by the name of T.B. Joshua entered the country.
    <br>Not just the nation - the whole world.
    <br>Do you know that international media - Reuters, the New York Times -
    <br>came to cover this event because of the noise.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our detractors made us the star attraction
    <br>and the noise of our enemies has now become the voice of our testimonies.
    <br>Do you know the same people who opposed this event, that protested against this event
    <br>they went on the streets with placards and said, "T.B. Joshua is not welcome to Nazareth"
    <br>are the same people saying, "When is he coming back?"
    <br>because of the spiritual, economic benefit that was derived from the community.
    <br>And when he comes back - that one is left to God.
    <br>All I'm here to tell you,
    <br>as a Christian, your detractors are simply making you an attraction.
    <br>The noise of your enemies will become the voice of your triumph.
    <br>The noise of your enemies will become the voice of your success.
    <br>The noise of your enemies will become the voice of your progress.
    <br>Where then is there room for offence?
    <br>"How can they treat me like this? How can they say this about me?
    <br>I'm coming to invest in this community. Why are they treating me like this?"
    <br>Do you know what you are doing?
    <br>You are simply inflicting damage on yourself.
    <br>In conclusion:
    <br>Every step that a Christian takes, God is aware.
    <br>We don't defend ourselves - we have a Defender. God is our Defender.
    <br>If you know that God is your strength, you will not fight a human battle;
    <br>you will leave the issue for Him.
    <br>If they lie against you today, leave it for God.
    <br>Don't harbour offence; don't inflict damage on yourself.
    <br>If they persecute you today, leave it for God.
    <br>If they falsely accuse you today, leave the issue for God.
    <br>Imagine Jesus Christ on the Cross.
    <br>He was crucified for our offence, yet He held no offence against us.
    <br>Instead He so loudly declared, "Father, forgive them!"
    <br>'Them' includes you and I.
    <br>'Them' includes both offender and offended,
    <br>both attacker and attacked, both victim and perpetrator.
    <br>"Father, forgive them!"
    <br>There is nothing too small or too big we should overlook for the sake of Jesus.
    <br>Just imagine, Jesus went on the Cross to bear the pain for us.
    <br>Why would anyone here now inflict more pain on themselves by nursing a grudge?
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
