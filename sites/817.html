    <br>Warning! The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>This young woman has arrived at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>seeking solution to her problem.
    <br>We can see her arm being held livelessly at her side,
    <br>afflicted with a terrible ulcer at the top of her hand.
    <br>The severity of her wound has attracted flies and infection as it has grown and eaten away her flesh.
    <br>One can only imagine the pain and discomfort that the open sore has caused her,
    <br>rendering her hand useless.
    <br>Debilitated at such a young age, she is desperately searching for someone somewhere to heal her wound.
    <br>As Isaiah 53:5 reassures us:
    <br>Our healing is paid for and offered freely.
    <br>By Christ's wound we are healed.
    <br>I have a house girl. She confessed that she was an obanje (possessed)
    <br>and she delivered an egg.
    <br>Immediately, I carried the egg and burnt it.
    <br>Since then, my hand that I used to carry the egg has become rotten.
    <br>She laboured as if she wanted to deliver a baby.
    <br>She opened her legs and said, "Aunty, it's coming, it's coming".
    <br>Behold, I saw an egg, a live egg came out of her private part.
    <br>With my little faith, I carried the egg, put fire on it and burnt it.
    <br>This is the hand that I used to burn it.
    <br>The doctor said that it would be amputated.
    <br>I ran to the man of God to help me. Please, help me, Man of God,
    <br>so that they would not amputate my hand.
    <br>The woman said that her house maid confessed that she was a witch
    <br>and gave birth to an egg.
    <br>She explained how she took the egg with her own hand and burnt it
    <br>and that was how the hand ulcer appeared.
    <br>Can you just say your prayer; ask for the mercy and favour of God.
    <br>Lord Jesus, forgive me; have mercy on me.
    <br>Have mercy on me so that I can be delivered and
    <br>my hand will not be cut off.
    <br>Father, forgive her, in Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>You are free. Go.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>After the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the woman came back to The SCOAN to testify to the miraculous healing she had received.
    <br>An arm which was once left to be amputated
    <br>has now being totally restored back to life.
    <br>We can see how the mighty hand of God has brought divine healing to her flesh.
    <br>An agony she once felt is a thing of the past.
    <br>Jesus Christ, the Master Healer, has healed her effectually.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Who is like my Jesus?
    <br>Who is like my Jesus in this world?
    <br>Who is like my Jesus?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Anthonia. I came from Abuja (Nigeria) to give my testimony.
    <br>The God of T.B. Joshua, I have never seen your type o.
    <br>This kind God o - blessed be Your holy name.
    <br>I had a problem with my hand. That was what brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>I had a hand ulcer.
    <br>I was happily married when I employed a house girl to live with me.
    <br>It was the house girl who separated me from my husband.
    <br>The house girl confessed that she was a witch and after that,
    <br>she delivered an egg in my presence; I don't know how that could happen.
    <br>I was confused and didn't know what to do.
    <br>I used my hand to pick up the egg after which I set fire to it and burned it.
    <br>The next day, my hand became swollen.
    <br>My hand began to hurt me.
    <br>I was taken to different places but nobody could help me.
    <br>Doctors wanted to amputate my hand. I cried.
    <br>As I was watching Emmanuel TV, my in-law advised that I should be taken to see T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That was how they took me to this place and the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Brothers and sisters, come and see.
    <br>After the man of God prayed for me, the ulcer disappeared!
    <br>I am healed and there is nothing that I can't use this hand to do.
    <br>I wash clothes, cook and do everything with this hand.
    <br>My advice to people is that they should believe and trust in God and
    <br>they should have faith.
    <br>Whatever the situation, there is nothing that God cannot do.
    <br>Here was my last bus stop. I believed that God would heal me;
    <br>I came and I got my healing. Have faith and believe in God.
    <br>God that did it for me will do it for everybody.
