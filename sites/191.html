    <br>PRAY WITH T.B. JOSHUA - BE RESCUED!!!
    <br>I want to pray for you.
    <br>Stretch your hand right now, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself, be disconnected!
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself, say, "I am disconnected!"
    <br>Say, "be disconnected!"
    <br>Be disconnected!

    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ! Amen!
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Tell yourself, "Jesus loves me."
    <br>He is concerned about you.

    <br>He is concerned about my finances.
    <br>He is concerned about my business.
    <br>He is concerned about my career.

    <br>You know that whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself:
    <br>chain of poverty, chain of setback, chain of limitation.
    <br>I say be broken! Be broken!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits

    <br>Your business, be rescued!
    <br>Your career, be rescued!
    <br>Say, "Be rescued!"
    <br>Say, "I rescue you, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You know to be rescued.
    <br>When you are rescued, your life is rescued.
    <br>I mean, everything about you is rescued.
    <br>You are rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You satan, you demon, I call you by name, leave them alone!
    <br>Leave my people alone, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I disconnect you from whatever chain satan might have used to connect you.
    <br>I disconnect you from satan!
    <br>I disconnect you from demons!
    <br>I disconnect you! Be disconnected!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>This is a prophetic word - I can see you being delivered.

    <br>I prophesy to your life, your career is free!
    <br>I prophesy to your life, the way out for you has come!
    <br>Confess it, "The way out for me has come!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers at home, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Listen to me, the way out for you has come!
    <br>I said, the way out for your business has come.
    <br>Those of you on the sickbed, I say to you, "Dry bones shall rise again!"
    <br>Let there be light!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Those of us on the sickbed -
    <br>You have been on the sickbed for many years; you have been sick.
    <br>I say renew your strength!
    <br>Begin to renew your strength, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Renew your bones, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Renew your fluids, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Renew your strength, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I say to you, check yourself, move around, move your limbs, move your system,
    <br>because the way out for your health has come.
    <br>The owner of the soul, the owner of the bones has replaced it.
    <br>The owner of the fluids has replaced it.
    <br>The owner of the bones has replaced it.
    <br>The owner of your body has touched it.
    <br>Jesus is the owner; He has touched you.
    <br>Be touched, be healed, be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>He is the owner of your business and your finances.
    <br>He is concerned about your finances, business, marital life and career.
    <br>Right now, in the name of Jesus, be free!
    <br>He wants you to be free. Be free!
    <br>He wants your business to be free. Be free!
    <br>He wants your career to be free. Be free!
    <br>He wants your finances to be free. Be free!
    <br>Say, "I am free!"
    <br>Hear the voice of God.
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough in my business!
    <br>Breakthrough in my career!
    <br>Breakthrough in my finances!
    <br>Breakthrough in my marital life!
    <br>Breakthrough in my finances!
    <br>Breakthrough in my career!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Do you know the meaning of breakthrough?
    <br>Where there is no way, God provides a way for you.
    <br>As from today, where there is no way, Jesus will provide a way.
    <br>All things are possible.
    <br>All things will begin to be possible for you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Who says he wants evidence?
    <br>Answer to your prayer is evidence.
    <br>Receive this answer.
    <br>The answer has been provided,  in Jesus name!
    <br>Begin to share your testimony!
    <br>I am justified; I am no longer condemned.
    <br>Defeat and failures are things of the past.
    <br>I am born again!
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>I am delivered!
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>"Thank you, Jesus!" is my testimony.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus, for my finances.
