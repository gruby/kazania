    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>At The SCOAN Wise Man Christopher prays for the people in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and the evil spirits in them begin to manifest.
    <br>Remember, satan is powerless in the face of God's armour and weapons.
    <br>As he continues to use the name of Jesus to make demons to tremble and flee,
    <br>this very huge woman you see begins to manifest.
    <br>Let's see how her deliverance took place.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>Why are you asking me again?
    <br>Haven't I told you who I am?
    <br>What's your problem?
    <br>- Stand right and talk!
    <br>- I'm standing right.
    <br>- Who are you?
    <br>- I'm a man like you. What's your problem?
    <br>What are you doing in the body of a woman?
    <br>She is my wife. What's wrong with that?
    <br>What have you done to her marriage so far?
    <br>Marriage? OK, can somebody marry two husbands at a time?
    <br>She's married.
    <br>She can't marry again.
    <br>What are you talking of?
    <br>Marriage?
    <br>What happens to the men that used to come to her?
    <br>There is no love.
    <br>I won't allow her to love any man.
    <br>Never, because I love her.
    <br>She can never love any man.
    <br>- What have you done to her career?
    <br>- Career? Well, nothing is going on.
    <br>She is talented.
    <br>God blessed her, as you can see, but nothing is working out.
    <br>She can never move forward. Her education - I stopped everything.
    <br>She didn't go to school. She stopped at class 3. Nothing happened.
    <br>She can do anything. Even if she looks at you, she can do things but
    <br>I won't allow her to be perfect in anything.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>How did you enter this body?
    <br>When she was born, her mother left her.
    <br>Her uncle took care of her and then I entered her.
    <br>What I know is that I am the one that is guarding her.
    <br>What have you done to other people?
    <br>Nothing. Only her. I just want to destroy her.
    <br>That time she wanted to get married, I inflicted this fatness on her so that no man would ever like her.
    <br>Anybody that sees her will call her, "Madam", instead of calling her a lady.
    <br>- How old is this body?
    <br>- Only 36.
    <br>But she started answering to 'Auntie' when she was 14 years old.
    <br>They started calling her, "Auntie Obie". 
    <br>Everybody was respecting her.
    <br>- Why were they calling her "Auntie"?
    <br>- I don't know.
    <br>Do you know what?
    <br>God blessed her; she was just a special child but I don't want that to manifest.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>There was a time she wanted to claim to be born again.
    <br>She entered the church and the thing entered her and she started following the prayer warriors.
    <br>You know, when the Spirit comes, I can't share it with her; I just stay away.
    <br>What I am going to do is make her to be angry.
    <br>If she is angry, the Spirit will go away and I will come in.
    <br>I will take control, yes!
    <br>Which Spirit normally goes away and you would come in?
    <br>Your Spirit, you know.
    <br>- Which Spirit?
    <br>- That One - God!
    <br>Don't you know your God?
    <br>The One you used to hold me.
    <br>- Who is holding you?
    <br>- That thing you call your Spirit!
    <br>I want her to go away; I asked her to go there.
    <br>She refused and asked, "Should I go? Should I stay?"
    <br>I confused her telling her that people will be watching her on television.
    <br>Why do you make her to believe that people will be watching her on television
    <br>so that she would not come for deliverance?
    <br>I know that she always feels ashamed in everything.
    <br>She doesn't respect herself; she does not want people to laugh at her.
    <br>That is what I used to...
    <br>- You used to do what?
    <br>- I used to use any shameful something.
    <br>She is fat. As she is fat like this, she does not go out.
    <br>She does not want people to see her.
    <br>Coming here is because of this prophet!
    <br>- Which prophet?
    <br>- T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He came to visit her in her dreams, saying that she should go and give testimony.
    <br>She has been wanting to come here since last month.
    <br>I asked her, "How would you go there?"
    <br>You don't have to go there; nobody is like you there.
    <br>Don't you know you are very fat?
    <br>What kind of spirit will enter you?
    <br>She accepted. The first money she borrowed, she finished.
    <br>I brought so many problems to collect money from her.
    <br>And now she is here.
    <br>It is that man that asked her to come and give testimony.
    <br>She said, she is not ready to testify now.
    <br>The man said, "You must give testimony!"
    <br>She said, "No" and was arguing until she woke up from her dream.
    <br>You know she was very stubborn.
    <br>When she came to the hotel, you came to her in a dream again!
    <br>Now, you are here physically.
    <br>You said each time the Spirit leaves through anger, you enter.
    <br>Can you explain who are you?
    <br>Who are you; who is your own god?
    <br>- You mean me?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>I told you, I am the husband.
    <br>- From where?
    <br>- From the deep sea.
    <br>- Which sea?
    <br>- Niger.
    <br>- Speak louder.
    <br>- Niger.
    <br>- Speak louder.
    <br>- The river Niger!
    <br>And who is the God that used to be inside,
    <br>whenever that god is inside you, will go out? Who is that God?
    <br>That is your God.
    <br>- Call the name.
    <br>- The Most High.
    <br>- What is His name?
    <br>- The Most High God.
    <br>She is very prayerful; she used to deliver people, even some pastors.
    <br>When she was in prayer, she could see danger coming to a pastor.
    <br>She would call her prayer warriors; they'd enter into prayer, fasting and have vigil.
    <br>But that woman she was praying for - she used to go to her ministry to pray - the woman remarried.
    <br>I went to the Bible and told her, "You see, you called this woman a woman of God.
    <br>Why did she remarry when the first husband is still alive?"
    <br>She said she would not go to church again.
    <br>She is not going to church for seven years now!
    <br>She said, "These people are leading us to hell."
    <br>She stopped going to church; no more prayers.
    <br>Cover my life with the blood of Jesus - she would just lie down.
    <br>Right now, your time has expired.
    <br>Time?
    <br>- And your mission has come to an end.
    <br>- Which mission?
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every part of your body, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>All over your body!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Now, go!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for her deliverance.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>What? What is it?
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, madam?
    <br>- Do you know where you are?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Where are you?
    <br>- I am in The SCOAN.
    <br>I came here to see what is happening to me.
    <br>I saw you in my dream.
    <br>- You said you are a man in this body.
    <br>- No, I am a woman.
    <br>That evil spirit that took position of a man in you is cast out by Jesus.
    <br>- So, follow Him!
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for delivering me!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Holy Spirit!
    <br>Thank You, Ancient of Days!
    <br>You are the King of kings and Lord of lords!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Obi Ofoegbu, I'm coming from Anambra State.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was that I didn't know what was happening to me.
    <br>Nothing I put my hands on moved at all.
    <br>The spiritual husband used to disturb me in my dreams.
    <br>When I would wake up, nothing I laid my hands on would go well.
    <br>Some people hated me for no cause.
    <br>I didn't finish my education because of this spiritual husband.
    <br>When I was still in class 3, before my WAEC, somebody stole money in the classroom.
    <br>They said I was the one and they expelled me from school.
    <br>When I came back, I told my father and he said I should stop going to school
    <br>because my mum was late - I never knew my mother.
    <br>Whenever I went, things got lost but I would not be the person.
    <br>I noticed that if I came to your place and stayed for some time,
    <br>another spirit would say, "Get away from there before something gets lost again
    <br>and they say that you are the one."
    <br>This had been happening to me.
    <br>In my spiritual life, I noticed that I didn't have the Spirit to pray or to stand for God.
    <br>I always liked coming closer to God, but the spiritual husband
    <br>used to draw my spiritual life back; sometimes, it came through anger.
    <br>In my physical life, men would like to come to me but with time,
    <br>I would just hate that person without any cause.
    <br>Sometimes, the one I would like to go to, my family would say, "No."
    <br>I noticed that the type of fatness that came into my body, I couldn't even move.
    <br>I couldn't walk.
    <br>I couldn't do anything.
    <br>Before, I couldn't even stand for five minutes.
    <br>It is because of the deliverance that I am able to stand here and talk to you.
    <br>How Demons Made Me Fat! POWERFUL DELIVERANCE
    <br>I was doing nothing.
    <br>No amount of money that you would give me would last in my hand.
    <br>If I didn't know what to do with it, I would just share it to people
    <br>to make sure there was no money in my hand.
    <br>When people would look at me, they would think I had money;
    <br>they even respected me as if I had a car but I had nothing.
    <br>That was what the spiritual husband caused.
    <br>I came here because there was a day somebody on my street
    <br>was shouting, "God of T.B. Joshua!"
    <br>Because she was afflicted with a dead man's spirit.
    <br>I said, "What is wrong with this lady? She can't even say, 'God in Heaven.'
    <br>She continues shouting 'God of T.B. Joshua!'
    <br>Is the God of T.B. Joshua different from the God of Heaven?"
    <br>That was what I was thinking.
    <br>They later told me about Emmanuel TV and I connected to the cable.
    <br>Immediately I watched it, I called my pastor from Benin.
    <br>I asked him, "Pastor, have you heard about Emmanuel TV?"
    <br>He said, "Yes, it is real. It is not magic. I am telling you as a pastor, it is real.
    <br>Just go there if you want to go there."
    <br>How Demons Made Me Fat! POWERFUL DELIVERANCE
    <br>Tell us, when you arrived at The SCOAN, how did you receive your deliverance.
    <br>When I came here, I had the opportunity to enter the church.
    <br>The devil had been fighting so that I would not come in but I had made up my mind to come.
    <br>The first time last month, the money I borrowed wasted.
    <br>When I came here, they were standing in the line but I couldn't stand.
    <br>I got angry and cried to my God and said, "God, what type of fatness is this?
    <br>I can't even stand like others and get a card and come in."
    <br>All I knew was that if my leg could touch inside this church,
    <br>I would be delivered whether they touched me or not.
    <br>That was my faith.
    <br>When I came in, I wanted to pretend as if nothing was wrong.
    <br>When I saw Wise Man Christopher coming, I said that my leg was painful
    <br>and I sat down for him to pray for my leg.
    <br>He said, "Stand up! Who are you?"
    <br>Immediately, the thing came into my eyes and I couldn't see well any longer.
    <br>I was manifesting as they said.
    <br>When they brought me out, the evil spirit said, "What are you still doing there?
    <br>They are going to watch you on television. So. go!"
    <br>I said, "No, my pastor would call me and ask if they had delivered me.
    <br>Can I go and borrow money again to come back here? I must be delivered."
    <br>I was fighting with the evil spirit before someone brought me out here and said
    <br>I should enter the deliverance line.
    <br>That was how I was delivered.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>How Demons Made Me Fat! POWERFUL DELIVERANCE
    <br>After my deliverance, people of God, I am a different person.
    <br>How Demons Made Me Fat! POWERFUL DELIVERANCE
    <br>Before, I couldn't stand to this extent talking to you people.
    <br>I would either be bending down or would carry my hands to my head.
    <br>If I stood a little, from my neck to my toes would be painful.
    <br>Since I came here, I noticed that all those things have disappeared to the glory of God!
    <br>How Demons Made Me Fat! POWERFUL DELIVERANCE
    <br>Right now sister, tell us what were the challenges you have been facing.
    <br>The challenge I am facing is that I am not doing anything.
    <br>I am just living from hand to mouth.
    <br>But when you look at me with all that I have, you will think that everything is OK for me.
    <br>But it is only me and my God that know how my life is going.
    <br>Please man of God, I am pleading for you to help me.
    <br>And by the grace of God, the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>are giving her the sum of 300,000 naira and 3 bags of rice.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>How Demons Made Me Fat! POWERFUL DELIVERANCE
    <br>Praise the living Jesus!
    <br>I thank God for this gift that was given to me.
    <br>Thank you, brethren, for sitting and listening to me.
    <br>Man of God, I thank you very much for this gift given to me.
    <br>And I pray God will help me to walk in His statutes and do His will
    <br>and run away from sin, in Jesus' name!
