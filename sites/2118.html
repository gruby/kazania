  <p>    
    <br>Let us watch the New Anointing Water being ministered to another patient in an Intensive Care Unit.
    <br>I am Advocate Maseko.
    <br>I am practising law.
    <br>Currently, I can't do anything. I can't walk. I simply just can't do anything.
    <br>I must always be on oxygen in order to breathe.
    <br>For me to stay alive, I must stay on oxygen like this.
    <br>This is where I am - Intensive Care Unit.
    <br>These are my nurses.
    <br>Man In An Intensive Care Unit
    <br>This is where I am.
    <br>This is the New Anointing Water from Prophet T.B. Joshua that I want to minister to you.
    <br>You should know that distance is not a barrier to the Spirit of God.
    <br>Where you are right now in the hospital, God can reach you there.
    <br>- Be forgiven, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>- Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Out! Vomit it out! Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance Through The New Anointing Water
    <br>In the name of Jesus, you are free! You are healed!
    <br>Those things that you could not do before prayer, can you exercise yourself and check yourself?
    <br>- I can breathe!
    <br>- You can breathe now?
    <br>Yes, I can breathe; I can stand up!
    <br>- You can stand for long now?
    <br>- I can stand.
    <br>This is the first time I can stand this long without oxygen.
    <br>It is the first time that you stand this long without oxygen.
    <br>Give thanks to God! Jesus has healed you!
    <br>I give thanks to God!
    <br>Let's see what happens after the ministration of the New Anointing Water.
    <br>When I was being ministered to with the New Anointing Water from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the first thing I saw was something like a lion that was spitting fire;
    <br>so instead of water, I saw fire - there was a lot of fire.
    <br>As a result, I was under pressure.
    <br>It was like something in my chest had to come out.
    <br>I felt like vomiting.
    <br>The more he was saying, "Come out!" and spraying the water, the more the fire was.
    <br>It was like I was consuming fire!
    <br>When the water was sprayed, it was like the lion was spitting fire and it was entering my mouth.
    <br>I saw the lion on the screen of my phone.
    <br>It was very clear; the changes were massive.
    <br>For the first time that night, I could breathe without the oxygen machine!
    <br>I could stand, stretch, do all things and go to the bathroom.
    <br>Before, they had to bring something to me to relieve myself
    <br>but from that night, I could walk to the bathroom to relieve myself.
    <br>At that time, the infection markers were 170;
    <br>they dropped to 40.
    <br>Today, I was just told that my infection markers have dropped to zero - no infection anymore!
    <br>Then I was taken out of ICU.
    <br>I was the only person who was removed from the ICU.
    <br>The doctor said I was the patient who stressed him the most
    <br>because I was not responding to treatment at all - that was his stress!
    <br>I was breathing too fast, but the way the markers went down was a miracle for him.
    <br>They just went down very fast, which was not normal.
    <br>The doctor was not expecting that in the ICU, the infection would just drop like that.
    <br>I can breathe! Can you see?
    <br>No oxygen machine!
    <br>Throughout this interview, I have not used oxygen and I'm not struggling.
    <br>I can breathe.
    <br>I am ready to go and serve God better than I did before!
    <br>Any time I think of my condition, I feel like crying!
    <br>God has been great; He showed up and He showed off!
    <br>I am very excited!
    <br>Thank You, Master Jesus, for sending the Anointing Water to South Africa.
    <br>I really appreciate it.
    <br>I'm back to life; I've got a second chance.
    <br>I'm fine now.
    <br>I feel good now; I'm ready to go home.
    <br>I can stretch.
    <br>I can stand for long.
    <br>I can lift my legs.
    <br>I can do everything.
    <br>I'm fine now.
    <br>After his miraculous healing through the New Anointing Water,
    <br>Advocate Maseko is discharged from the Intensive Care Unit
    <br>to see a beautiful sunny day outside
    <br>where he demonstrates his newfound freedom.
    <br>I am free! I am out!
    <br>I am out! As you can see, I can walk.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for sending the Anointing Water to South Africa.
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>I missed this life!
    <br>I am free! Thank You!
    <br>My name is Advocate Maseko.
    <br>I am happy that I am out of this place. I have been here for a long time.
    <br>It was very difficult, but God saw me through.
    <br>I saw the hand of God.
    <br>Six of us were admitted, but I am the only one that survived.
    <br>I was informed this morning that all of them passed on. They could not make it out of the ICU.
    <br>It was a very difficult experience.
    <br>I have been in the ICU. It was like a graveyard.
    <br>People were not responding to treatment and were intubated.
    <br>I was just sitting there. I was the only one who could talk or do anything
    <br>because of the Anointing Water God has sent through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am so grateful! I am thankful to God!
    <br>I am ready to serve Jesus better than before.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>This is my wife. I have missed her so much.
    <br>I am seeing her for the first time in 20 days. This is the 21st day.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Good Morning! My name is Portia. The man next to me is my husband.
    <br>It was really difficult.
    <br>I was so afraid that I was going to lose my husband at my young age.
    <br>I am thankful for the New Anointing Water. Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am happy! God really showed up for us.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free! I can do anything!
    <br>I can exercise! I can do anything! I'm all good. I am ready to go home.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners around the world have been receiving the New Anointing Water.
    <br>When you have the Anointing Water, you have the solution with you.
    <br>You are a problem solver.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>My name is Caroline and I am from South Africa.
    <br>Ten years ago, I was diagnosed with a condition called neuromyelitis optica.
    <br>This means there is an infection in the nerves of my spinal cord.
    <br>Therefore, I cannot walk.
    <br>I experience body weakness and numbness - loss of sensation.
    <br>My lower body is most affected.
    <br>This condition also affects my eyes. Every now and then, I experience blurry vision.
    <br>It has also affected my bladder.
    <br>Because of this, my bladder mostly retains urine.
    <br>Because of this condition, I also experience constipation.
    <br>I am always constipated because I am immobilised.
    <br>I have been on chronic medication for the past 10 years.
    <br>There is no cure for this condition.
    <br>However, doctors have been treating the symptoms.
    <br>During the past 10 years, I have been using different medications they think
    <br>might be effective for the condition.
    <br>However, there haven't been good results.
    <br>The main problem is that I relapse a lot.
    <br>I have had countless episodes of being in and out of hospital.
    <br>These are the pain medications and muscle relaxants I have been taking.
    <br>Some of the medications have been causing me skin problems.
    <br>I have to go to hospital every six months to receive more medications.
    <br>This is the medical report that explains everything wrong with my spinal cord.
    <br>Here is the diagnosis - neuromyelitis optica.
    <br>These are all the problems I experience
    <br>- bladder malfunction, poor bowel mobility, recurrent visual loss with relapses -
    <br>and these are the current medications that I take.
    <br>I have been using a wheelchair for the past 10 years.
    <br>My husband has to push me around.
    <br>I believe that God can do it for me.
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV; I see people receive their healing every day.
    <br>I believe the God of T.B. Joshua will do it for me through this New Anointing Water, in Jesus' name.
    <br>This is the New Anointing Water and I believe God will heal you, and I know you believe too.
    <br>I'm spraying now.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus; in the blood of Jesus, I pray.
    <br>Be healed! Be free! Be delivered! In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every sickness and disease must leave you, in the name of Jesus; in the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Every sickness and disease must leave that body, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed! Receive your healing! Receive your deliverance!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed!
    <br>Receiving Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Poisonous Substances Vomited
    <br>Jesus Christ has set you free. Amen and Amen.
    <br>Amen.

    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!

    <br>I am standing up now; I just got up.
    <br>Healed Of Inability To Walk Through The New Anointing Water - No Longer Using A Wheelchair

    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for setting me free!
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Healer. Stay in faith and believe Him.
    <br>Stay in the Word of God. Amen.
    <br>Recall that this was the woman who for the past 10 years had to be pushed around by her husband in a wheelchair.
    <br>Let's listen to her as she further testifies about her miraculous healing
    <br>after the ministration of the New Anointing Water.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>My name is Caroline and next to me is my husband, Musawe, and we are from South Africa.
    <br>After receiving prayer through the New Anointing Water, I received strength in my body.
    <br>There was a movement in my spinal cord and I felt so much strength and heat in my body.
    <br>I want to thank God today because I have strength in my legs.
    <br>I am standing here feeling free. I am free!
    <br>I want to thank God and Prophet T.B. Joshua for giving us this grace through the medium of the Anointing Water.
    <br>I am so happy! My heart is filled with so much joy!
    <br>I am so happy and grateful!
    <br>May God bless you, man of God, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Good Morning! My name is Musawe. The woman next to me is my wife, Caroline.
    <br>I would like to thank God for the miracle we received today in our home.
    <br>We would also like to send our appreciation to the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>for distributing the New Anointing Water.
    <br>The New Anointing Water was ministered to my wife and she received her healing.
    <br>We really thank God that He has delivered us from the problem we had since 2010.
    <br>She was in a wheelchair, but we thank God today that we are free! My family is free!
    <br>We really want to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>We truly thank God that distance is not a barrier.
    <br>The Anointing Water was ministered to us in South Africa through a phone.
    <br>That's how she got her deliverance. No hands touched us.
    <br>We really thank God for your amazing work and the grace.
    <br>Truly there is nothing impossible with God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I won't be needing the wheelchair anymore because Jesus has set me free!
    <br>He that has been set free by Jesus is free indeed!
    <br>Amen! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free! Hallelujah.

    <br>After that, I couldn't play football.
    <br>I had an operation, after which the problem got worse.
    <br>I am very delighted to receive the New Anointing Water and Sticker.
    <br>As soon as I touched the New Anointing Water and Sticker, I felt a sensation in my body.
    <br>I vomited some substances.
    <br>When I touched my knee with the Sticker, I felt something moving in it,
    <br>as if my knee was being operated on.
    <br>You can see my knee as it's moving; I don't know how to explain it.
    <br>The power of God is still moving.
    <br>Today, I received my deliverance.

    <br>As I entered the room, I started feeling uneasy.
    <br>As soon as I touched the table on which the New Anointing Water was, I just 'flew off'.
    <br>I felt something happening within my body; I felt fire all around me.
    <br>I felt something hitting me - something very hard, which the demons would not want to touch.
    <br>I'm feeling so light.
    <br>I'm feeling very refreshed and I'm very happy again.
    <br>All the promises of Jesus are in this Anointing Water, which is the Blood of Jesus.

    <br>My name is Evelyn. I am a Nigerian living in France.
    <br>God has set me free from sickness.
    <br>I was always sick. If it was not my head, it would be my back or my legs -
    <br>for over five years.
    <br>I am happy I received the New Anointing Water.
    <br>When I received it, it was like there was something in me, which I find difficult to explain.
    <br>It was just like I carried a heavy object.
    <br>When I pressed my chest, it was like those things were coming out.
    <br>I feel very light! I'm feeling good!
    <br>Healed Of A Back Problem Through The New Anointing Water & Sticker

    <br>Healed Of A Back Problem Through The New Anointing Water & Sticker
    <br>Our names are Mr & Mrs Nzaou-Simba.
    <br>I'm originally from Congo, but I reside in South Africa.
    <br>I have had piles for more than 20 years.
    <br>I've been suffering from this incurable sickness.
    <br>I've tried many ways to get healed of it, but nothing worked.
    <br>All the treatments I had were to no avail; I never got relieved.
    <br>When I go to the toilet, I have problems releasing and sometimes my anus comes out.
    <br>I have to push it back inside with my finger.
    <br>That really makes me feel weak sometimes as a man.
    <br>These are the issues that worry me and why I need prayer.
    <br>My name is Mrs Nzaou-Simba. I am from Congo Brazzaville and am staying in South Africa, Cape Town.
    <br>I'm facing a lot of challenges.
    <br>I have allergies.
    <br>The allergies I have affect my throat, nose and eyes.
    <br>I'm always on medication.
    <br>It's been a long time - almost ten years.
    <br>If I don't take medication, I cannot sleep or eat.
    <br>I will bleed from my nose and mouth; it is very painful.
    <br>Help me! Pray for us!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>I'm holding the Anointing Water that was given to me by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I want to minister this Anointing Water to you.
    <br>Be forgiven, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I finished her."
    <br>How have you finished her?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I destroyed her. I finished her. I finished him."
    <br>The evil spirit says, "He took my wife."
    <br>She does not belong to you.
    <br>Go, in Jesus' name! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name. Thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>You are free. Rise up.
    <br>You are free. Your family is free. Your husband is free.
    <br>Let's see what happens after the ministration of the New Anointing Water.
    <br>My name is Mrs Nzaou-Simba. I came from Congo Brazzaville. I stay in South Africa, in Cape Town.
    <br>When the Anointing Water was sprayed on me, I felt heat; my whole body was hot.
    <br>My feet went up.
    <br>The demon started to manifest and confess.
    <br>Then, I was delivered.
    <br>After my deliverance I feel free.
    <br>The heaviness in me has gone.
    <br>The fear and worry that was inside of me disappeared.
    <br>I feel calmness and peace in my heart.
    <br>The heaviness I was feeling up and down my throat has gone.
    <br>I feel light and free.
    <br>Since that day, I've not taken any medication.
    <br>I am free and I thank God for my life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My name is Mr Nzaou-Simba.
    <br>After the prayer everything became normal.
    <br>I can go to the toilet and release.
    <br>There is no more bleeding.
    <br>I can defecate without difficulty.
    <br>I'm free! I'm okay!
    <br>It is amazing; distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Through the Zoom meeting, we were prayed for with the Anointing Water
    <br>and we were delivered.
    <br>It's amazing that the anointing of God can go far!
    <br>Before, our marriage was a mess.
    <br>After the prayer with the Anointing Water, we are living in peace. There is joy and calmness.
    <br>After the prayer with the Anointing Water, we are living in peace.

    <br>Let's see what happens as the New Anointing Water is ministered to her through a video call, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I'm going to administer the New Anointing Water on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua.

    <br>And we say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Let's see what happens after the ministration of the New Anointing Water.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>My name is Patience. I am a South African. As I am speaking now, I am in South Africa.
    <br>Last week Tuesday, I experienced a nosebleed.
    <br>My son said that we must go to a pharmacy to get something to stop it.
    <br>On our way, the bleeding got worse.
    <br>My son made a U-turn to the nearest hospital.
    <br>When I entered the hospital, the doctor told me to sit up as I was not able to lie on the bed.
    <br>They could not control the bleeding.
    <br>Then I made a phone call to one of the Emmanuel TV Partners in Johannesburg.
    <br>I sent them the pictures of my situation because I couldn't speak.
    <br>They got back to me through a video call.
    <br>They prayed for me with the New Anointing Water.
    <br>This is the New Anointing Water.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>When he was praying for me, I felt something like bubbles inside my nose.
    <br>Then I found out the bleeding had stopped.
    <br>When I blew my nose, the tissue was clean.
    <br>Now, blood is no longer coming out of my nose! My tissues are clean!
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>They noticed I was recovering speedily so I was discharged on Saturday.
    <br>I can show you now.
    <br>Healed Of Nosebleed Through The New Anointing Water
    <br>It is clean!
    <br>There is nothing coming out! It is clean! No blood!
    <br>I am 'number one' (all fine now).
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>- Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>This is what helped me - the New Anointing Water.
    <br>I am free now! I am free from everything!
    <br>Man of God, I would love to say to you: Keep on doing the good work of God.
    <br>GOOD CHRISTIANS ARE GOOD CITIZENS
    <br>THIS VIDEO DOES NOT DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM SEEKING MEDICAL TREATMENT.
    <br>THE TABLET, THE MEDICINE THE DOCTOR HAS GIVEN YOU -
    <br>IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD WITH MEDICINE
    <br>YOU CANNOT BELIEVE IN GOD WITHOUT MEDICINE.
