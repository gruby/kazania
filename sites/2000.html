    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I want to welcome our father.
    <br>Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove - Minister of God & Disciple of God's General, A.A. Allen, USA
    <br>Looking at our father, you will know it is our grandfather.
    <br>I will not stand here as a boy and begin to introduce...
    <br>Let grandpa talk, let's hear.
    <br>You are welcome, sir.
    <br>I am evangelist C.S. Upthegrove from the United States of America.
    <br>I want to thank God for the privilege of being here in Africa for the first time.
    <br>A global evangelist, revivalist, author, renowned minister of God
    <br>and one of God's generals - C.S. Upthegrove.
    <br>For 68 years he has been preaching the Gospel all over the world.
    <br>Born into a humble family in Florida, USA, the second youngest of 21 siblings,
    <br>he had discovered the direction of his calling from the tender age of 15.
    <br>Since that time, he has travelled the world with the message of hope and salvation
    <br>that Jesus Christ is the Healer and Deliverer to hundreds of thousands around the globe.
    <br>During his ministry countless people have come to the knowledge of God's saving grace.
    <br>Through the anointing of God upon his life numerous people have been touched,
    <br>healed, delivered and blessed through the powerful ministry God has given him.
    <br>Now 83, he is still active in the ministry and is dedicated to reaching
    <br>as many souls for Christ as he can.

    <br>When you do what God has put in your heart to do, you will make a difference in your world.
    <br>God's general, C.S. Upthegrove is truly one with a difference.
    <br>This is evangelist C.S. Upthegrove
    <br>and my biggest advice to you is to keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>God will bless you for that. Amen.
    <br>You know, I knew William Branham, Jack Coe, Oral Roberts;
    <br>I knew all these men, I go all the way back to the Voice of Healing days,
    <br>and I knew all of the signs and wonders.
    <br>I have been in their services and rejoiced.
    <br>I have been with Kathryn Kuhlman, I have seen so many, but listen:
    <br>Everything that I am seeing in the ministry right now of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>supersedes anything that I have seen under those ministries.
    <br>It is a greater measure and it is exactly what brother Allen said would happen.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God with us - (Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I want to praise God for this privilege.
    <br>I am 83 years of age.
    <br>Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove - Minister of God & Disciple of God's General, A.A. Allen, USA
    <br>I have been married 61 years to the same wife.
    <br>I have four children - 2 boys and 2 girls.
    <br>My oldest girl is here with me, Brenda.
    <br>Brenda Price
    <br>Daughter of Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove, USA
    <br>I am walking on holy ground.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>Many years ago, when I was working with great men of God like A.A. Allen,
    <br>William Branham, Oral Roberts, R.W. Shambach, great men of the past,
    <br>God gave me an opportunity to stand on their shoulders.
    <br>I was riding one day in the automobile with A.A. Allen and he looked over at me and he said,
    <br>"Brother Upthegrove, I may not be living when this comes to pass but I believe you will".
    <br>And he began to describe this place.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>He began to talk about a man that would walk out under the anointing
    <br>and the power of the Almighty God.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>He further described all of the miracles I have witnessed since I have been here.
    <br>On Thursday, when the wise men began to minister, I couldn't help but sit there and weep
    <br>because of the fulfilment of the prophecy that the man of God had given me.
    <br>A.A. Allen said, "Brother Upthegrove, there will be a multitude of people
    <br>from all over the world who will hear simultaneously"
    <br>and this was many years before we had the technology we have now.
    <br>There was no internet.
    <br>There was nothing like we know now in the way of modern technology.
    <br>He further began to tell me about the anointing and the power
    <br>that was going to come upon such men as Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>In the middle of the '60's in 1966, he began to describe to me the mannerism
    <br>in which the Spirit of the Lord would fall.
    <br>When I walked into this place, the Spirit of the living God witnessed to me
    <br>and said you are walking on holy ground.
    <br>Brother Allen furthermore said to me,
    <br>"Brother Upthegrove, when you see this begin to happen,
    <br>know that the time is near to the making up of the Bride
    <br>without spot and without wrinkle."
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>When the man of God told me personally,
    <br>"As I would move in the spiritual realm and see these things to come to pass,
    <br>God would make provision for me to be there and see it for myself."
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>I thank God for the privilege for the way being made for me to be in this place right now.
    <br>Ever since I have been here, I remembered when I first saw on Emmanuel TV
    <br>this man of God as he began to move in supernatural realms
    <br>and saw the prophecies that came to pass.
    <br>Make no mistake about it, you are living in the presence of a mighty prophet sent from God.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>God said to me as I was watching this man on Emmanuel TV, "This is My prophet."
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>And He said, "I am establishing around the world 12 appointed apostles and prophets."
    <br>And God said to me, "T.B. Joshua will be one of the 12 prophets
    <br>that God will establish around the entire world."
    <br>When God told me that I said, "Oh, Lord, make a way for me. I want to be there."
    <br>Then a telephone call was made and I will never forget how elated I was
    <br>when they came and said the prophet said you are to come to Nigeria.
    <br>Now that I am in Nigeria, I am beginning to see and remember the things
    <br>that the prophet told me about so many years ago.
    <br>When I was 29 years old, my hair was blonde and I went on a 21 day fast.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>In that fast, God began to talk to me about the last days
    <br>and the ministries of the last times.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>I found myself under a big oak tree in the middle of that fast.
    <br>A bright light began to shine through that oak tree.
    <br>As the light came closer and closer, shimmers of light coming through the oak tree
    <br>formed into an angel of God, about 12 feet tall.
    <br>When I saw this awesome, beautiful thing from Heaven, I fell face forward; I fainted.
    <br>The first thing I remember was a gentle touch on the top of my blonde hair when I was 29.
    <br>And a voice said, "Fear not".
    <br>When an angel says, "Fear not", the fear is gone.
    <br>I found myself standing erect, looking up into the eyes of this beautiful angel.
    <br>His voice was as the voice of many waters, his eyes were like flames of fire
    <br>much like the description in Revelation.
    <br>He said, "My son, the Father sends this message, 'Thou shalt go forth and I will go before thee;
    <br>I will direct thy path. I will make a way where there seemeth not to be a way.
    <br>I, the Lord, will go before thee and there will be a special anointing in your right hand.
    <br>You will see signs, wonders and miracles like never before' ".
    <br>Before the angel was through talking,
    <br>all of a sudden I noticed that I was not looking up at him any longer;
    <br>I was face to face with this beautiful angel.
    <br>I didn't understand it but when he finished giving me the message,
    <br>he raised his hand and left much like he came, back through the big oak tree
    <br>in the shimmering lights and left and went back to Heaven.
    <br>When I looked down, my feet were not on the ground.
    <br>I had risen to the height of the angel.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>Then slowly, I came back down to the earth.
    <br>In a few short days, my hair changed to the colour that you see right now.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>Then, when the Spirit of the Lord began to speak to me about what He uses
    <br>to prove that He has power.
    <br>I said, "Lord, tell me more. What do You use to prove that You have power?"
    <br>When I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua using water, I said, "That's one of them."
    <br>I said, "God can use water."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>And then, God spoke to me and said, "I can use a stick in the hands of a man called Shamgar."
    <br>600 Philistines were slain with nothing more than an ox goad.
    <br>That's a stick that he used to control the oxen.
    <br>And he slew 600 Philistines.
    <br>God said, "I can us a stone."
    <br>And He used a stone in the sling of David to slay a giant.
    <br>God used a stone underneath the head of the prophet of God that had a vision
    <br>and angels were ascending and descending all the way to Heaven.
    <br>Then, God said, "I can use less than that.
    <br>I can use nothing more than a dried up bone."
    <br>So, God took a man who had been slain on the battlefield
    <br>and he was thrown in on the grave of Elisha.
    <br>When his dead body touched the dried up bones of Elisha, he sprang to life again.
    <br>If anyone asks you, "What does God use to prove that He has power?"
    <br>You tell them that I said, "God uses sticks and stones and dead men's bones."
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>If God can use sticks and stones and dead men's bones to prove that He has power,
    <br>He can use me and He can use you.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>One man formed nothing more than a shadow and the shadow touched the sick
    <br>and the sick were healed.
    <br>One man stretched forth his hand and the spoken Word healed the sick.
    <br>A great man of stature in the Word of God came to Jesus and said,
    <br>"My servant lieth home sick unto death."
    <br>Jesus said, "I will come and heal him".
    <br>He said, "No, Master. I am not worthy for you to come under my roof but speak the Word only."
    <br>There is power in the spoken Word.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>I call that 'Spoken Word faith'.
    <br>One of the greatest kind of faiths that God uses is 'Touching faith'.
    <br>One woman that had an issue of blood had no help until she said within herself,
    <br>"The answer to your problems could be within yourself.
    <br>If I can but touch the hem of His garment, I will be made whole."
    <br>I call that 'Touching faith'.
    <br>The greatest faith I've ever come acquainted with comes from Hebrews 11:1.
    <br>The Bible says now faith is the substance of things hoped for; the evidence of things not seen.
    <br>I call it 'Now faith'.
    <br>Most of you are here today because you need a miracle, now.
    <br>How many need a miracle, now?
    <br>'Now faith' - when Prophet Joshua walked out here and God shows him that people need miracles, now;
    <br>they need deliverance, now.
    <br>Glory!
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>I prayed and I asked God, "Lord, reveal to me please, what can I do
    <br>to help Your people who need help so desperately?"
    <br>Thank God for men like Prophet Joshua that God uses to help millions become liberated.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>Please, hear this little story; it will bless you.
    <br>There was a pilot of an airplane.
    <br>He was a young Christian pilot.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>They were stationed overseas near a large river that is called Snake River.
    <br>The reason they called it Snake River was because there were so many snakes
    <br>of every kind in that river.
    <br>One day, the sirens blew and the young pilot knew he had to run,
    <br>jump in his aircraft and meet the enemy.
    <br>But when he started to get into the airplane,
    <br>there was a long boa constrictor lying in the path.
    <br>He said, "Snake, I don't have time for you, now."
    <br>He jumped over the snake into the cockpit and took off.
    <br>But when the plane became airborne, he couldn't retract his landing gear,
    <br>that is, the wheels would not come back up into position.
    <br>He said, "That snake has wound itself up in those wheels and I can't retract them,
    <br>therefore, I won't be able to go fast enough to repel the enemy that's coming."
    <br>So, he said, "God, I need a miracle, now."
    <br>He was about to manifest 'Now faith'.
    <br>Everybody say, 'Now faith'.
    <br>Right now.
    <br>He said, "Lord, help me, now."
    <br>Then, he remembered immediately a story.
    <br>His father had him in the woods when he was only 12 years old.
    <br>His father said, "Son, what do you see?"
    <br>He said, "Dad, there are trees everywhere."
    <br>He said, "Look higher, son. Way up on top of the mountain. What do you see?"
    <br>He said, "There are no trees growing on top of the mountain."
    <br>"Son, do you know why?"
    <br>"No, dad, I don't know why."
    <br>He said, "Because trees have to have oxygen to live.
    <br>When the air gets too thin, trees will die."
    <br>"More than that - it is interesting to note that when you get above that tree line
    <br>even snakes can't live because they have to have oxygen."
    <br>He said, "Thank you, dad", pulled up on the stick and got above the snake line.
    <br>And the snake fell out, dead.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>The Spirit of the Lord spoke to me and I feel His anointing now.
    <br>I feel the glory all around me.
    <br>The Lord said, "My people are living below the snake line.
    <br>My people need to get above the snake line".
    <br>Anything below the snake line, I can tell you what they are.
    <br>Worry - below the snake line,
    <br>frustration, aggravation, irritation, aches, pain, trouble, sorrow, tears, fears, discontentment -
    <br>all kinds of problems when you are living below the snake line.
    <br>But if you will pray and the Holy Spirit of God will come upon you,
    <br>you will rise up above the snake line.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>We call it the Shekinah Glory realm.
    <br>What I have felt from the time I stepped into this place was God's Shekinah Glory.
    <br>Thank God Prophet T.B. Joshua is living above the snake line.
    <br>Thank God he is teaching me and you how to live above the snake line.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>I want to mention one more thing about the snake line.
    <br>Anything between you and God is your god.
    <br>I will repeat that.
    <br>Anything between you and God is your god.
    <br>When you get into the glory realm...
    <br>Everybody say, "Glory realm."
    <br>When you get into the glory realm, everything else is forgiven.
    <br>And as the prophet told us this morning, you are free.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>When you are free and the glory and presence of the Almighty God
    <br>is all around you and all over you,
    <br>you get above the snake line and live in His glory.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>This will make an old man shout.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This will make a sick man get well.
    <br>This will make somebody bound be free
    <br>simply by getting above that snake line.
    <br>Everybody say, "Praise the Lord!"
    <br>When God made it possible for me to come to see the prophet,
    <br>He spoke to me to bring something with me to put into the hands of the prophet.
    <br>Just before I left to come here,
    <br>the Lord said, "Write something down, I am going to give you a prophecy."
    <br>And you can find it for me here.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>I wrote this to the prophet before getting on the plane.
    <br>"Behold, My son.
    <br>I speak to you in this very hour.
    <br>A door will be opened to you like never before.
    <br>Thou hast asked and I have heard thy prayer.
    <br>I have begun to prepare dignitaries from around the world to accept thy vision.
    <br>From this very hour you are appointed as one of the 12 prophets that I will establish around the world
    <br>to usher in the bride of Christ without spot or wrinkle.
    <br>Thou hast truly followed the example of My own Son.
    <br>When you blessed the sick and poor you have done it unto Me.
    <br>I will restore everything that the canker worm and the palmer worm and the caterpillar
    <br>and the locust hath eaten away, even to the bark of the tree.
    <br>You will see My hand move not many days hence.
    <br>You are My end time messenger and appointed prophet for this hour,
    <br>to usher in the bride of My Son; thus saith the Lord God."
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>This was written and prophesied before I arrived and before some of the prophecies came to pass
    <br>that the prophet prophesied after I got here.
    <br>I thank God I am walking on holy ground.
    <br>The Lord said, "Furthermore, I want you to give to My prophet some pictures
    <br>that were made in the Miracle Valley, Arizona", which was the home of the late, great A.A. Allen.
    <br>I am holding before me his offices in 1966, and the beautiful mountains of Miracle Valley, Arizona.
    <br>Then, another picture of Brother Allen's Miracle Magazine, that he published in 1964.
    <br>This is me on this side, my sister is in the middle and my wife is on this end.
    <br>We were in the A.A. Allen Great Healing Tent Revival;
    <br>a tent that was larger than a football field and about the size of this sanctuary we are in now.
    <br>My sister had a twisted back from Polio - one hip higher than the other.
    <br>The man of God, A.A. Allen laid his hand on her -
    <br>she fell and she stood up as straight as I am.
    <br>That's why that picture and story was in that magazine.
    <br>Here is a picture of Brother A.A. Allen at Christmastime in 1966.
    <br>That is his sister standing there, and this is brother Upthegrove here with a white coat
    <br>and my wife is next to me.
    <br>Brother Allen enjoying the Christmas dinner.
    <br>And the other picture that goes along with that
    <br>is one of the gifts that brother Allen received.
    <br>He was receiving a brand-new suitcase to keep travelling for Jesus
    <br>and he did as long as he lived.
    <br>I will show you a picture which you won't hardly believe.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>This is me at Miracle Valley, when I am 38 years old and I am on brother Allen's horse.
    <br>This is A.A. Allen's horse in Miracle Valley, and that's me on the horse.
    <br>Soon after I left the valley, I felt the anointing so great in my life.
    <br>I was preaching in Detroit, Michigan where I went for a two weeks revival
    <br>that lasted three and one half years.
    <br>In the middle of that revival while I was preaching, someone took a picture
    <br>and I was preaching on Elijah and the whirlwind of fire that took him up to meet the chariot.
    <br>Here is a picture of me and the whirlwind of fire actually surrounding me
    <br>and I felt like I was going to lift off that stage.
    <br>This was in Detroit, Michigan in 1968.
    <br>To show you: God can use anybody, anywhere and anytime
    <br>that will pay the price to get above the 'snake line'.
    <br>This is a personal letter that I received from brother A.A. Allen, back in 1965,
    <br>when he was in the Philippine islands,
    <br>inviting me to come and be Pastor of the Miracle Valley church.
    <br>I have something very special in my hand that I am going to present
    <br>to the prophet in just a moment.
    <br>And he is coming now...
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>This is something that I have treasured for a long time.
    <br>As I told you, back in 1965, 1966, 1967,
    <br>there was nothing ever heard of like a computer or modern technology;
    <br>everything had to be done the hard way.
    <br>So, brother Allen went out and had a rubber stamp made with his name on it.
    <br>This is brother Allen's personal rubber stamp.
    <br>His name is inscribed on here and they made a rubber stamp just like his signature.
    <br>I had watched this man of God and he felt to answer every letter personally.
    <br>Thousands of letters came in and I can still see Pastor reading those letters
    <br>and stamping them with this very stamp - letter after letter after letter after letter.
    <br>I can feel it now.
    <br>When it was presented to me, I said the Spirit of the Lord is still in that stamp.
    <br>God can use anything.
    <br>I told you - he can use sticks and stones, dead men's bones; He uses water.
    <br>He uses shadows and he used this stamp in the hands of A.A. Allen.
    <br>When it was passed to me, I treasured this and I kept it.
    <br>My children said, "Leave it to us, dad."
    <br>I said, "No, this is not for the inheritance of the children.
    <br>This is to pass on to another prophet of God."
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>Bishop, it is my pleasure to present to you this stamp.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>There is only one more thing - this is Brother Allen's obituary at his funeral
    <br>and everything in there concerning his passing.
    <br>He really died too young; he was only 59 years old but he did great works while he was yet alive.
    <br>I want to thank God that this man is not dead, he is alive.
    <br>And the God within him is very alive.
    <br>The works you see now are just the beginning of what you will see.
    <br>I promise you.
    <br>The REVELATION God Gave Me About TB JOSHUA!!! | Evangelist CS Upthegrove
    <br>Well, I am a child.
    <br>You have listened to our grandpa.
    <br>We have read so much about A.A. Allen - God's general.
    <br>He is one of the 'greats' in the century.
    <br>Those who humble themselves under Jesus Christ
    <br>have taken the best source to secure themselves.
