    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Come here. Where's your husband?
    <br>He is at home.
    <br>- Your husband is at home.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>What is the problem?
    <br>He wants to fight for politics.
    <br>There was a problem, sir, in the family.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>At The SCOAN Sunday service, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the people,
    <br>separating them from every chain satan used to connect himself.
    <br>Let us hear what the demon inside this lady says.
    <br>Speak out! Who are you inside this body?
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>I destroyed everything.
    <br>What have you done to her marriage?
    <br>I destroyed the marriage. They will not have peace.
    <br>She is my queen.
    <br>She is your queen. Who are you?
    <br>How do you manifest as a queen in her life?
    <br>How do you operate in her life?
    <br>I made her suffer.
    <br>How did you make her suffer?
    <br>I destroyed her career.
    <br>Before any competition, what did you do to her?
    <br>I gave her pain.
    <br>Why did you give her pain?
    <br>I gave her injuries.
    <br>You gave her injuries for what? Why did you give her injuries?
    <br>I just want her to suffer.
    <br>You want her to suffer?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did you enter this body?
    <br>Through friends.
    <br>The prayer of faith sets her free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm delivered!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Praise God, people of God!
    <br>My name is Mercy Cherono. We are from Kenya.
    <br>I am an athlete running 5000 meters and 1500 meters.
    <br>I have represented my country in many championships.
    <br>I was even last year in the Olympic games; I was fourth.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>Last week, I was here in the church.
    <br>I came here for my career breakthrough.
    <br>My husband advised me that I should come here for my career breakthrough
    <br>because I was having problems in my career.
    <br>That's why I came here.
    <br>I was surprised when the man of God came to me
    <br>and prophesied to me that where my husband was and what the problem was.
    <br>I thank God because the man of God prayed for me
    <br>and delivered me from the spirit that was giving me the setbacks in my career and marriage.
    <br>Madam, can you just tell us - the man of God in that prophecy mentioned
    <br>about your husband and asked about the trouble in the marriage.
    <br>Can you just explain to us more about that prophecy?
    <br>How that prophecy is true?
    <br>The prophecy was very true because we have been married for four months now
    <br>and before we got married, we had a lot of challenges.
    <br>After we got married, whenever we had a small issue, it would just become so big
    <br>and we could even stop talking for one or two days in the house.
    <br>So there was a lot of anger.
    <br>So even though as a young marriage just four months,
    <br>already you were having a lot of fights and quarrels in the home.
    <br>Yes, there was a lot of anger in the house.
    <br>Even a small problem, it would even be bigger; we could even stop talking.
    <br>You mentioned that even before you got married, there were some issues that you had.
    <br>Can you tell us - what was the major problem, even before you finally got married to your husband?
    <br>Before we got married, there were some controversial issues in the family.
    <br>We were almost married, and there were a lot of controversial issues.
    <br>We thank God we got married and are here now.
    <br>So we're listening to what our sister is saying that this is just a very young marriage
    <br>just four months but before the marriage, there were a lot of controversies in the family
    <br>concerning the marriage and even after marriage, there has been a lot of turmoil in the house, fighting.
    <br>The controversy in the family was because there was another woman who has a child for him.
    <br>It was very hard for me.
    <br>Okay, so before marriage, your husband had a child with another lady.
    <br>Do you mean to say that that lady was trying to cause some challenges between you
    <br>and your getting married to him?
    <br>Yes, we were about to get married.
    <br>She was disturbing with a lot of calls.
    <br>So we can understand the reason why the man of God gave this prophecy
    <br>about the troubles in this young marriage but we give glory to God
    <br>that our sister is here with her husband today in The SCOAN.
    <br>Madam, we saw in the clip how during the deliverance, the evil spirit mentioned
    <br>about how it really affected your career negatively.
    <br>Can you just describe more about the problems you are facing in your career
    <br>as an Olympic athlete before you came to the church.
    <br>Before I came to the church, my husband told me that I should come here
    <br>to The SCOAN for my deliverance in my career
    <br>because whenever I was training so well, preparing for any championship,
    <br>when I was almost at the championship, I would develop an injury.
    <br>I used to take even strong pain killers to sustain me, to run the event.
    <br>But after the competition, the pain would become worse than before.
    <br>I would stop and nurse the injury.
    <br>Can you give us an example of this?
    <br>Maybe in your last major championship at the Olympic games, tell us what happened.
    <br>Even last year before the Olympic games, I developed a stress fracture
    <br>but I didn't know it was a stress fracture.
    <br>I would take strong pain killers to sustain me, train and run.
    <br>I never told anyone, not even my cousin.
    <br>I was thinking, maybe if I said I had pain, I would be removed from the team.
    <br>After that, I was running with that pain.
    <br>I could not do as I was supposed to do with my capability.
    <br>After the championship, I was taken for treatment in Italy.
    <br>It has been like three years now.
    <br>Every time it got close to a championship, I would develop an injury.
    <br>We understand what our sister is saying that even in the recent Olympic games
    <br>that were held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, our sister was competing in serious pain
    <br> because just before the competition, she developed a stress fracture.
    <br>She said that any time she was training, she was doing very well
    <br>But when the competition approached, the world championships approached,
    <br>that was when an injury would come that would limit her
    <br>from performing to her full capabilities in the event.
    <br>So you mean to say, madam, during the Olympic games you were running with that pain
    <br>and that was the reason that you were unable to make it to the medal table,
    <br>you only came out in fourth position. Is that right?
    <br>Yes, that made me to be in the fourth position because I could not do as I was supposed to.
    <br>We saw earlier in that clip how that evil spirit that was plagueing our sister's life actually said
    <br>that it caused these injuries and that pain that really affected her negatively
    <br>before her coming to The SCOAN.
    <br>Sister, we thank God that you came and just tell us to the glory of God,
    <br>ever since the deliverance and the prophecy last week,
    <br>what are the changes that you have seen in your life?
    <br>Ever since I came here, after the deliverance, I've been feeling light.
    <br>Everything is going on well.
    <br>Hallelujah. Your husband is now with you here
    <br>What can you say about the changes in your relationship with him after that prophecy?
    <br>After the prophecy, the man of God invited my husband, that he should come.
    <br>Everything has changed like we have just started a relationship.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Sister, you mentioned that you had this severe injury in your foot
    <br>that hindered your running.
    <br>Does it mean that even when you were in the church last week,
    <br>you were still having that pain?
    <br>Yes, when I came here, I was still feeling a little pain but now, I don't feel it anymore.
    <br>After the prayer you mean the pain has gone completely?
    <br>Yes, I don't feel it anymore.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>We give all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Sister, we can see a couple of pictures on the board.
    <br>Could you just show us what we're seeing on the board here to the glory of God.
    <br>The pictures here on the board:
    <br>The first photo was in the USA.
    <br>This was at the world championships in 2013 in Moscow; I got a silver medal.
    <br>This was at the last year's Olympic games in Rio; I was fourth.
    <br>We thank God that our sister has received a complete deliverance from those spirits
    <br>that were hindering her from reaching her full potential as an Olympic athlete
    <br>representing Kenya for so many years.
    <br>And we thank God that not only deliverance has come
    <br>but peace has been restored to her young marriage as well after that word of prophecy.
    <br>At this point, we want to hear a word from your husband as well.
    <br>Praise God, Church!
    <br>My name is Edmond; I'm from Kenya.
    <br>I am here because the man of God invited me that I should come here for deliverance.
    <br>Only last week, when I was watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>that was the time when the man of God asked my wife where her husband was.
    <br>Thereafter, I planned to come here for deliverance.
    <br>Glory be to God. So you mean the lady beside you - who is she to you?
    <br>She's my wife.
    <br>Ok, sir. After hearing that word of prophecy, what can you say about the challenges
    <br>that you faced in your marriage for the last number of months?
    <br>Okay, I must say that we have been having challenges.
    <br>We have only been married for four months.
    <br>We would quarrel or have a misunderstanding over small issues.
    <br>Two weeks ago, I asked her that she should come here for deliverance.
    <br>Okay, sir. Can you just give us an example of maybe one of the challenges
    <br>that you faced with your marriage that really caused that anger to come.
    <br>Just give us an example.
    <br>Okay, an example is that: I'm a politician as well as a businessman in Kenya
    <br>and at times we would receive many visitors at our home
    <br>and in many occasions, she wouldn't be happy when we received visitors.
    <br>We would end up not talking for even two or three days.
    <br>So when that anger came upon you, what happened?
    <br>When that anger came into me, I would go silent for two or three days without talking to her.
    <br>We thank God that our brother responded to the invitation of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to be here today and sir, ever since you came to The SCOAN,
    <br>and you've been with your wife, what are the changes that you have witnessed in her?
    <br>There have been a lot of changes since I came here last Friday.
    <br>When I met her, she was happy.
    <br>She talks to me more than she used to talk to me.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty and we thank God for our brother's coming to The SCOAN
    <br>and the wonderful reconciliation that is taking place through that word of prophecy
    <br>and the deliverance that happened last weekend.
    <br>Sir, you are holding an object. Can you just explain to us what you are holding here.
    <br>As I said, I'm a politician.
    <br>What I'm holding in my hand is a symbol of leadership and peace in our country.
    <br>I'm vying for the member of County Assembly in our country.
    <br>We thank God that indeed, our brother has come to seek the face of God concerning political aspirations.
    <br>We give glory to God that the two of them are here today in The SCOAN.
    <br>Sir, we would like to ask you: What is your own word of advice
    <br>to our viewers all over the world, especially to married couples
    <br>that may be facing one or two problems in their marital homes?
    <br>My advice to young families out there is that:
    <br>My wife came here last week for deliverance and I am also here for the same deliverance.
    <br>The small misunderstanding you could be having in your family
    <br>could be that there is a spirit behind it
    <br>and I advise you that you should also seek deliverance for your families.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We have listened to our brother that oftentimes married couples face challenges
    <br>and because God is not involved, sometimes those challenges,
    <br>disagreements can even lead to separation, can lead to divorce,
    <br>can lead to extramarital affairs and all of these things only make matters worse.
    <br>So our brother is simply advising that we should seek the face of God
    <br>and realise that oftentimes, there are some spirits involved that are not from God
    <br>and deliverance is required for peace to be properly restored to the home.
    <br>We thank God that this young marriage was rescued by their coming to The SCOAN.
    <br>Let's just hear a final word from your wife as well.
    <br>We would like to ask your advice as well to our viewers all over the world, especially to married couples.
    <br>My advice to all the viewers all over the world and athletes:
    <br>Whenever there is a situation in your life, you should seek God
    <br>because God has the final answer for your problems.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>One more time, we give glory to God. We pray that God will give this couple the grace
    <br>to continue to make His Word the standard for their lives
    <br>and we know that more testimonies are coming, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Sister, when are you going for your next competition?
    <br>When is the next competition you're going for?
    <br>My next competition will be the world championships this year in London.
    <br>I believe that you're going to be coming back here with a big testimony concerning that very soon.
    <br>I believe that I'm coming back here for my testimony, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
