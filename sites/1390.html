  <p>    
    <br>At just a touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua, demons are forced to bow to the superior power of Jesus
    <br>and problems give way to heavenly solution.
    <br>Among the thousands receiving prayer is this lady.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>- We are many.
    <br>- Number one?
    <br>Spirit of lust.
    <br>- Number two?
    <br>- Spirit of rejection.
    <br>- Number three?
    <br>- Spirit of anger.
    <br>Number four?
    <br>I caused her many disappointments.
    <br>What have you done to her marriage and carrier?
    <br>I have taken away her career.
    <br>What have you done to her family?
    <br>I put so many limitations in her family.
    <br>With the evil spirit exposed and disgraced, she receives complete freedom, in Jesus' name.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Felicity. 
    <br>I am from Kenya.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the spirit of lust, spirit of anger,
    <br>spirit of rejection and the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>The spirit of lust and prostitution affected me so much.
    <br>It affected my academics.
    <br>It all started when I was 12 years old.
    <br>There was a dog in our family - I was given a dog as a pet.
    <br>When I slept, in my dreams, I would see the dog coming to sleep with me.
    <br>I would have the urge to sleep with older men.
    <br>I would behave the way dogs behave when they are looking for other dogs to mate with.
    <br>It really affected my academics.
    <br>I would not study.
    <br>"I Slept With 20 Men DAILY..." | SPIRIT OF SEDUCTION!!! ðŸ˜¨
    <br>I passed through that way of life.
    <br>When I got to the street - I was given powers by the evil spirit all over my body -
    <br>and when I looked at a man, he would not be able to resist me.
    <br>I would just look at the man and he would follow me.
    <br>Can you tell us how would you look at the man?
    <br>I would stare at the man's eyes and he would not say no to me.
    <br>So those spirits gave powers in your eyes,
    <br>and when you would stare at the man, the man would just follow you.
    <br>And what would happen after that?
    <br>I would sleep with them and make sure that I took a picture.
    <br>I would later inform the man's first born child or his wife.
    <br>Later, the marriage would separate and they would file for divorce.
    <br>So after seducing those men with those powers in your eyes, especially married men,
    <br>you end up destroying their homes by sending a picture to their wives or first born son?
    <br>- And that would destroy the marriage?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Tell us, how many marriages have you done this to?
    <br>I have destroyed over ten marriages.
    <br>How many men in a day would you sleep with, pushed by this spirit?
    <br>I would sleep with up to 20 men in a day not because I lacked anything,
    <br>my parents are able to educate me and take care of me
    <br>but the spirit that was in me, would push me to it.
    <br>When this happened to these marriages, how did it make you feel?
    <br>I would feel overjoyed.
    <br>I went to many churches for deliverance but instead of the pastors to deliver me,
    <br>I would seduce them instead.
    <br>I have looked for a solution for more than 15 years because I was tired of the problem.
    <br>I thought I had come to the end; many times, I had suicidal thoughts.
    <br>There was a time, I left home and went to stay at a man's place.
    <br>My parents were not aware of my whereabouts.
    <br>After three days, I received a call from one of my relatives
    <br>telling me that the police were looking for me.
    <br>That was when I decided to go back home.
    <br>So the spirit has also pushed you to try to commit suicide because you were tired of the problem?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Tell us, when you came to The SCOAN, what happened to you?
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN last Sunday, I received a touch from the man of God.
    <br>I was not able to look at his eyes because I could feel fire coming out of his eyes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>I could feel the fire coming out of his eyes and I could not look at his face.
    <br>That was how I received my deliverance and I thank God for my deliverance.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>After your deliverance, tell us how are you feeling?
    <br>How has your body been?
    <br>How were you before and how are you now?
    <br>Before, I had the urge to seduce men but now, I no longer have the urge to seduce men.
    <br>So that urge to seduce men is no longer there?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And physically, how do you feel?
    <br>I feel light and I am overjoyed that Jesus identified me.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Going by that past life of destruction you have done to those marital homes,
    <br>how are you feeling now, when you remember all that you have done?
    <br>I feel guilty and I want to tell those whose marriages I have destroyed that I am very sorry.
    <br>They should forgive me.
    <br>Amen. We know that none of us has committed any unpardonable sin.
    <br>Jesus Christ receives repentant souls; He loves them, He welcomes them.
    <br>The worst of sins can be forgiven.
    <br>We know that now that you have been delivered,
    <br>those homes that have been affected have also been delivered, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We really want to thank God for the deliverance you have received.
    <br>We want to ask you, what is your advice to people who are listening to you right now,
    <br>who are in the same position you once found yourself?
    <br>My advice to them is that they should look to Jesus.
    <br>I would like to tell my fellow youths that they should give their lives to Jesus and not to worldly things
    <br>because today's youth don't want to listen and obey their parents.
    <br>I know my parents are watching me at home.
    <br>I would like to apologise to them for the pain I have caused them.
    <br>I know they are also watching you, and they have forgiven you from the bottom of their hearts,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>We know that you were not the one but there was a spirit that was in you
    <br>that was controlling you and motivating you to destroy.
    <br>As we all know, the Book of John 10:10 says the devil only comes to steal, kill and destroy.
    <br>But we thank God that Jesus Christ comes to give us life and life in abundance.
    <br>We want to encourage you to continue to make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Remember that the steps of a righteous man are ordered by God.
    <br>You should continue to make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Stay away from sin and make His Word an integral part of your being
    <br>and it shall be well with you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
