    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Confused, dismayed and stranded in real trouble;
    <br>that is how this group of pilgrims found themselves,
    <br>after it had surfaced that the person who had brought them to Nigeria,
    <br>under the guise of a SCOAN Tour Coordinator had actually lied, duped and defrauded them.
    <br>Looking completely un-remorseful, this is the South African woman,
    <br>who has defrauded all these people and more of hundreds of thousands of rands,
    <br>under the false pretence of being a Tour Guide of The SCOAN.
    <br>As you listen to their experiences, viewers, beware of fraudsters - they are real.
    <br>My name is Lucy, I am from South Africa.
    <br>I was introduced by a friend when I wanted to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>She said there was someone who was an agent who could take me simply,
    <br>without being interviewed by people from The SCOAN.
    <br>The woman is Rose.
    <br>She comes from South Africa, staying mostly in Pretoria.
    <br>Firstly, I paid 13,500 rands for the flight and accommodation.
    <br>I was told to pay another 6,000 rands which, she said, I would get back on return from Nigeria.
    <br>That was the money they I paid but to my surprise,
    <br>we were supposed to board the plane by six in the morning.
    <br>I was at the airport by a quarter past seven; she was nowhere to be found.
    <br>When I phoned her, she said she was around
    <br>and asked me, "Can't you see my bags?"
    <br>I was looking around; I could not see any bags for her.
    <br>After nine, she arrived and the plane was already gone.
    <br>We went to the desk of Arik flights. We checked.
    <br>They told us that the tickets were not booked.
    <br>I told them that I was not going back home because next week, I would be writing the exam.
    <br>I would rather go to SAA and ask for a ticket.
    <br>If they had a space, I would pay for myself and come here
    <br>because she told me that my name was on the invitation list from The SCOAN.
    <br>That was why I was so interested to come because
    <br>I had already received an invitation which I was not shown.
    <br>I believed that she had already got my invitation.
    <br>When I went to SAA desk, there was a lot of space
    <br>but I couldn't leave my friends behind because they were also keen to come here.
    <br>I paid for four of them; the other lady paid for three of them.
    <br>The money I paid was 5,400 rands per person, on top of the 13,500 rands
    <br>and 6,000 rands I had paid.
    <br>This morning, I paid 22,000 rands for four people's to come here.
    <br>Were you shown any evidence from The SCOAN
    <br>that indeed the church had invited you?
    <br>No. Not anything that I can remember.
    <br>What did she tell you about where the money you were paying her was going?
    <br>She told us that when we got back, she would claim the money for us
    <br>because part of the money was supposed to be paid to The SCOAN for our accommodation.
    <br>Can you explain to us what happened when you arrived at the airport in Lagos?
    <br>When we arrived in Nigeria, there was nobody from The SCOAN
    <br>and we knew that normally we would have a representative from The SCOAN
    <br>who will receive us and take us to the church.
    <br>To our surprise, there was nobody.
    <br>She phoned somebody.
    <br>We didn't know who she was phoning.
    <br>To our surprise, we saw this man coming in - the man sitting next to me.
    <br>When we asked her, she said that this man was at the garage with the cars.
    <br>We thought this man was from The SCOAN.
    <br>However, those who came from The SCOAN wear something which indicates
    <br>they are coming from the church.
    <br>This man did not wear anything indicating that he came from The SCOAN.
    <br>That was why the vehicle we used was a private taxi.
    <br>Three more people were supposed to be with us.
    <br>They returned back on their way to Pretoria on Tuesday evening.
    <br>They paid 13,500 rands twice because the third person was a child.
    <br>She is very, very sick.
    <br>They did not have the 6,000 rands that they were supposed to pay.
    <br>I paid 12,000 rands for them to be here
    <br>because I felt the child needs deliverance.
    <br>They are not here because she told them that they cannot come because
    <br>the invitations from The SCOAN had not yet come back.
    <br>They have not yet received the money.
    <br>I am going to claim all my money back from her.
    <br>She still has the passports and money of those who did not come here.
    <br>They were calling her but she was not answering her phone.
    <br>I feel so angry but on the other hand, I am so happy because I have just arrived at The SCOAN.
    <br>The woman we have just heard from has lost the most,
    <br>as she had tried to pay for others to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>who could not afford the over-priced trip offered.
    <br>Unbeknown to her, she was dealing with an imposter
    <br>and The SCOAN was unaware of both her intended visit and the others she was to travel with,
    <br>some of which are seated here.
    <br>Still bitter from her ordeal, this woman still has more to say.
    <br>What I can say is don't ever accept anybody as a coordinator
    <br>without being interviewed by representatives from The SCOAN
    <br>before you come to The SCOAN, Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>I have realised that she is not a representative of The SCOAN.
    <br>I don't know what her plan was because this plan was not God's will.
    <br>The way she was doing it, I wonder whether she knew God or not.
    <br>If she fears God, she would not be here with us,
    <br>knowing that she did not do what was expected of her.
    <br>So, I am telling my fellow South Africans, be careful.
    <br>If you want to come to The SCOAN, be patient until you receive
    <br>a proper invitation from T.B. Joshua's ministry in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Don't take shortcuts.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Another woman who was a victim of this horrendous case of fraudulent deception and avarice
    <br>was willing to speak out about her terrible experience
    <br>in hands of these ruthless people, who claimed to be representatives of the church.
    <br>My name is Miriam, from Limpopo.
    <br>Rose is a person who claimed to be a SCOAN Coordinator from South Africa.
    <br>All the people who are sitting here do not know each other.
    <br>We all met this morning except for Gerrie.
    <br>I left my house and went to Rose's place on the 4th of September 2012.
    <br>Rose told us we were leaving on the 8th of September 2012.
    <br>On the 6th, I called her asking what time we were to leave.
    <br>Then, she said we could not go
    <br>because there was another 6,000 rands repatriation fee
    <br>which was needed and by that time I had already paid her 13,500 rands.
    <br>So, that was plus an additional 6,000 rands making a total of 19,500 rands.
    <br>I am not working.
    <br>I asked my daughter who was working to apply for a loan so I could come to
    <br>The SCOAN because my marriage and business were scattered.
    <br>So, my daughter is now paying a loan off to the bank and the trip didn't materialise.
    <br>We waited another two weeks; she said we would leave after another two weeks.
    <br>After two weeks, we still could not come; she postponed the trip.
    <br>After that two weeks, there was a time of flooding in Nigeria.
    <br>I called her asking where she was and she said she had just received a call
    <br>from the man of God, T.B. Joshua that there were floods and we couldn't come.
    <br>Within five minutes, I received another call.
    <br>The person said he was phoning from The SCOAN, Nigeria,
    <br>notifying us not to come because of the floods.
    <br>The lady expresses her grief, as the woman claiming to be a SCOAN Coordinator
    <br>had demanded 19,500 rands for her trip to Nigeria;
    <br>an amount so large she needed her daughter to take a bank loan to secure the money.
    <br>As if that was not enough, the fraudster had severally postponed the trip,
    <br>citing the recent floods which had hit Nigeria as her excuse.
    <br>She also arranged for a false person to call from Nigeria,
    <br>acting as a SCOAN representative,
    <br>telling her not to come due to the floods,
    <br>whereas these recent floods had not come to the area of The SCOAN in Lagos.
    <br>As time went on, we were supposed to come here on the 27th of October
    <br>but that was when the programme changed.
    <br>We received messages notifying us that because of the programme
    <br>which had changed at The SCOAN, we could not come on the 27th.
    <br>We would come on the 7th of November.
    <br>And because we saw the announcement and everything on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>we believed that we would go.
    <br>Then, she said we would go on the 7th of November.
    <br>At ten minutes to six, we arrived at the airport.
    <br>I waited and I was alone.
    <br>It was six-thirty, then seven.
    <br>I phoned her but her phone was off.
    <br>I started to panic because many things have happened.
    <br>Then, I approached this lady.
    <br>I suspected that she was one of us
    <br>because I saw her going up and down panicking.
    <br>At the airport, I approached her and greeted her.
    <br>I asked her if she was also going to Nigeria and she said yes.
    <br>I said, "Me, too" and asked her who her agent was.
    <br>She said, "Mrs Makoka" and I said, "Even myself".
    <br>This is the woman, Mrs Makoko.
    <br>I said that even I was waiting for her.
    <br>Then, all of us went to South African Airways.
    <br>We paid an extra 5,060 rands each for new tickets.
    <br>Apart from the 19,500 rands which we paid Mrs Makoka.
    <br>We boarded the flight and came.
    <br>When we arrived in Lagos at the airport, we knew something was not right.
    <br>If she couldn't show us the airline tickets, it meant that where we were going,
    <br>there were no bookings.
    <br>When we arrived in Lagos, then, this man came and they shook hands.
    <br>I think she does business with him because
    <br>when you meet someone, give them a smile from a distance
    <br>and you shake hands, the impression is that you know the person.
    <br>When we left the airport, she made us believe that this man
    <br>was part of The SCOAN workers.
    <br>When we got to The SCOAN, we entered and they welcomed us nicely.
    <br>Then, they asked us if we had booked our reservations.
    <br>We showed the ladies our so-called coordinator.
    <br>But she was the one that knew everything.
    <br>They spoke to her and that was when we were certain that she had done nothing.
    <br>On arriving to The SCOAN, they realised the lady who claimed to be an agent of The SCOAN was fake,
    <br>and had made none of the reservations they had each paid almost 20,000 rands for.
    <br>All I can say to the world and South African citizens
    <br>is to be careful of fraudsters -
    <br>people like Rose who claimed to be a coordinator from The SCOAN
    <br>and collected money from innocent people like myself who are not working.
    <br>Follow the procedure.
    <br>Don't take shortcuts.
    <br>Let us listen to this man, who also fell victim to the fraud.
    <br>My name is Gerrie Carstens.
    <br>I am from South Africa.
    <br>After I got into an accident, my wife met Rose Makoka
    <br>asking money for Anointing Water and collecting money from people.
    <br>The small business my wife was doing and the money she collected
    <br>is the one she gave her.
    <br>People from South Africa and other places had money collected from them
    <br>and she told them that she would bring them the Anointing Water.
    <br>She said that she was an Emmanuel TV partner.
    <br>She goes around collecting money from people.
    <br>Everyone would be calling her and bringing money to her flat for Anointing Water.
    <br>I was not working.
    <br>My wife was going there and giving her small amounts until now
    <br>so that I could come here to Nigeria.
    <br>I cannot even tell you the amount that she gave.
    <br>When my wife comes home at night, there is not even enough food for the babies.
    <br>All the time, my wife was giving her money and I told her not to anymore.
    <br>She said now, that I must come.
    <br>That is why she must give her money.
    <br>Where did she claim she was taking you to when you left South Africa?
    <br>She came and told me that she was going to bring me to The SCOAN here in Nigeria.
    <br>She said our money was paid for the booking and where we would stay here.
    <br>From what we know, she never even bought flight tickets
    <br>with the money people gave her because we never saw them.
    <br>She is really a fraudster; there is no way she could be an Emmanuel TV Partner.
    <br>The only thing I can say for the viewers of South Africa
    <br>is to be careful; don't mix with fraudsters like Rose Makoka.
    <br>You can learn a lesson from this lady.
    <br>The man explained that he had been out of work for some time
    <br>due to an accident he had sustained
    <br>and that it had been his wife who was doing some small business
    <br>that had been paying money to the fraudster over a period of time,
    <br>for her husband's trip to The SCOAN.
    <br>He knew the woman in question as someone who used to receive people's money,
    <br>promising to bring them the Anointing Water, which is a free gift,
    <br>given free of charge at The SCOAN, alongside the DVDs and sermons of the ministry.
    <br>Here, you can read some of the messages the fraudster had sent to her victims
    <br>concerning the rescheduling of their visits to the church.
    <br>Next, let us hear from this man, the Nigerian accomplice of the fraudster,
    <br>who assisted them from the airport in a taxi.
    <br>My name is Magnus Eke.
    <br>I am from Imo State.
    <br>I was selling when I met Rose at the corner of the hotel owned by my brother.
    <br>When did you meet this woman?
    <br>Three months ago when she lodged in that hotel.
    <br>That is where I met her.
    <br>I used to help her and buy things outside the hotel - bottled water and other things.
    <br>When she was going, she would tell me when she was coming back.
    <br>She would call me and I would help her to call a taxi.
    <br>This evening she called me and told me that she was in the airport.
    <br>She asked where I was and I said that I was coming to the airport.
    <br>When I met her there, as somebody I know, I gave her a handshake.
    <br>She asked me to call a taxi for them.
    <br>So, I went and called a taxi driver.
    <br>After listening to the accomplice, the fraudster who had been sitting down
    <br>with a distant, unconcerned look on her face
    <br>and refused to admit to her wicked act,
    <br>was confronted and asked to open her luggage for inspection
    <br>by her angry victims, who now having seen her trickery exposed
    <br>demanded their money back.
    <br>I want to know where my money is.
    <br>This is proof that I paid the money into your account, Obani Investment.
    <br>Where is the money?
    <br>Give me my money!
    <br>I will give you when we go back.
    <br>What will happen to me?
    <br>Where are we going to sleep?
    <br>We don't have money for the accommodation.
    <br>We paid you for a flight to come here.
    <br>You told us that the money we gave to you would be paid to The SCOAN.
    <br>Where is the money now?
    <br>Because you did not pay a cent.
    <br>The church never received a cent from you.
    <br>Where is our money?
    <br>Understandably frustrated, the woman produced the payment receipts,
    <br>proving that she had paid money into the fraudster's account,
    <br>on demanding to know where her money was and what she had done with it.
    <br>Where is my money?
    <br>You know my daughter took a loan from the bank.
    <br>On inspection of the devious woman's luggage, certain documents were found.
    <br>A letter to the Nigerian embassy asking for a 3-week visa for the victims
    <br>and a document of purchase for a property in South Africa,
    <br>along with the acceptance of a payment of 1,400,000 rands.
    <br>Not only were these documents found,
    <br>but she was also in possession of a further 3 persons' international passports
    <br>of the victims of her scam, who were not finally able to make the expensive journey.
    <br>With such overwhelming evidence, the lady confessed to her crime.
    <br>My name is Rose Makoka, from South Africa.
    <br>I am a fraudster.
    <br>I lied to you that I brought your money here to The SCOAN.
    <br>There was nothing like that.
    <br>I never brought a cent to The SCOAN.
    <br>I used the money for expensive things.
    <br>I bought a house.
    <br>I bought clothes.
    <br>I paid rent.
    <br>This man is my partner is crime.
    <br>He used to pick us up at the airport to take us to the hotel.
    <br>In her hands the incriminating evidence: the passports, property deal, invitation letters
    <br>and various different ATM cards.
    <br>This is not the first time.
    <br>I have been duping many people for money.
    <br>I want God to forgive me.
    <br>I put money in my account and used it.
    <br>This is not my first time of doing this.
    <br>I put their money in my account.
    <br>This is not my first time.
    <br>I used the money to buy a house.
    <br>I sold Anointing Water to people in South Africa.
    <br>I lied that I am an Emmanuel TV Partner.
    <br>I sprayed Anointing Water on people.
    <br>Please, people of God, forgive me.
    <br>She kneels down to beg for forgiveness.
    <br>Please, people of God, forgive me.
    <br>I am sorry for duping people of their money.
    <br>Finally, hearing the truth from the woman they had given their money, passports and trust,
    <br>as a supposed representative of the ministry to bring them to The SCOAN,
    <br>emotions got the better of them and tears told the anguish they felt within them,
    <br>at this hardened criminal's treachery.
    <br>I found myself duping people of their money; this is a spirit of stealing.
    <br>After the confession had been made and news of the case brought to Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the man of God decided to intervene and help
    <br>not only the stranded victims but also the fraudster herself,
    <br>fully paying their accommodation, feeding and transportation costs
    <br>for the duration of their stay in Nigeria, at The SCOAN.
    <br>So we have listened to each and everyone's confession here today
    <br>and these people are here.
    <br>They have left their country, South Africa, and they found themselves in the hands of a fraudster.
    <br>Now, they are here stranded, in another country.
    <br>They have no money for accommodation, food or any other expenses here in Nigeria.
    <br>Out of compassion, Prophet T.B. Joshua has offered them accommodation.
    <br>He is paying for their accommodation, feeding;
    <br>he has even provided security for their safety.
    <br>He has paid all the expenses for the duration of their stay here,
    <br>as well as their transportation back to the airport to their country.
    <br>Viewers, learn a lesson from the painful experience of these people.
    <br>Beware of fraudsters and imposters
    <br>claiming to be representatives of The SCOAN or Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Unfaithful people are epidemic; they are everywhere.
    <br>As the Book of John 6:32-36 says, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Truth.
    <br>As the Truth, He is the Source.
    <br>Just as Truth is older than terror, so, it shall survive it.
    <br>Truth got the start and It will get the race.
    <br>To God be the glory.
