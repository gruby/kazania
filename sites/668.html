  <p>    
    <br>You are homeless.
    <br>That is, there is no house.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You paid money somewhere and
    <br> they refused to give you receipt.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Okay, don't worry. What happened to your former house?
    <br>It was burned by neighbours.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Josephine Iweke.
    <br>I am from Imo State, residing in Abuja.
    <br>I am a teacher, teaching at a junior 
    <br>secondary school.
    <br>I was in the first service when the man
    <br>of God came to me and said,
    <br>"Sister, you are homeless. What 
    <br>happened to your former house?"
    <br>I got up and said, "It's true, Man of 
    <br>God. It was burnt by neighbours".
    <br>After they burned it, the people that I am working with in the educational department
    <br>said that my life was not safe in that village.
    <br>So they transferred me to a town where I began to work in the school there.
    <br>The cost of living inside town was very difficult for me, with what I was passing through.
    <br>I asked my principal if she could get me a place to sleep at.
    <br>She said she did not have but asked if I could manage to sleep in the classroom after school.
    <br>I told her that I could manage.
    <br>After school, I would bring out my things where I had hidden them,
    <br>sweep the floor and sleep on a mat somebody had given me.
    <br>I would sleep on a mat next to the security man.
    <br>First thing in the morning, I would fetch water from the borehole, bathe and dress up.
    <br>Other teachers thought that I used to come to school very early.
    <br>I used to be punctual.
    <br>They were seeing me but didn't even know what had happened.
    <br>My principal was shedding tears. She said that she didn't want anybody to know
    <br>that I was staying there as a female teacher, for my safety.
    <br>That is how I became homeless in Abuja, up till now.
    <br>When we closed for this vacation, I went home to see my parents.
    <br>My mother then started crying because the case was in court.
    <br>The commissioner of police took the case to court against the person they had caught.
    <br>Then I came here with my parents.
    <br>The man of God prophesied to me that I was homeless. Up till now, I am homeless.
    <br>Everything in my bedroom got burnt. I had two rooms.
    <br>The other room had a plastic chair and a small television.
    <br>So, everything I had was burnt down.
    <br>When we resumed, I would go home and continue sleeping in the school.
    <br>Just tell us, for how long have you been in this condition?
    <br>Since January 30th when this thing happened, I have been sleeping in the classroom
    <br>because immediately the Education Department that I am working with
    <br>transferred me and intervened with the help of human rights activists
    <br>to whom the case was reported to.
    <br>I have been homeless. People have been assisting me.
    <br>We have heard from Mrs Josephine Iweke explain
    <br>how her house and possessions were burnt and as a result of this,
    <br>she had no other option but to sleep on the floor of the school in which she teaches.
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua gives Mrs Josephine Iweke a cash sum of 1 million naira to rebuild herself.
    <br>In addition to the 1 million naira, she is also presented with three bags of rice.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. Thank You, my God.
    <br>The Lord of Synagogue, the Lord of Prophet T. B. Joshua,
    <br>the Lord that created all of us, thank You!
    <br>Actually, teachers are the step that brought everybody to where you are.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for seeing me through.
    <br>We have many good samaritans in our midst who feel what others are feeling
    <br>We have listened to the plight of this woman.
    <br>In addition to this cash gift of 1 million naira from the anointed man of God and three bag of rice,
    <br>we want to call on the good samaritans in our midst
    <br>as the Spirit of God has touched your heart, to also make a contribution to this woman.
    <br>Please, can you step forward and also give your contribution to this woman.
    <br>She deserves our help.
    <br>Deeply touched by what Prophet T. B. Joshua had done for this woman,
    <br>many people from the congregation came out to help in their own way.
    <br>Remember, a time to give is not a time to show off but a time to reshape our destiny.
    <br>I am adding the sum of N100,000 to 
    <br>what the man of God has given her.
    <br>My name is Bodis from Bayelsa State.
    <br>On behalf of my wife, my son and my daughter, I am giving her N500,000.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Mr Emmanuel Nmankwo from Abuja, Nigeria.
    <br>I am supporting the man of God with N100,000.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>My name is Mr Pascal Odiegwu.
    <br>On behalf of my family, I am supporting the man of God with N200,000.
    <br>When we give, we create for ourselves a purse that does not grow old.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Josephine Iweke.
    <br>I am from Imo State, residing in Abuja.
    <br>I am very happy and grateful for what 
    <br>God has used Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV partners all 
    <br>over the world to do in my life.
    <br>Honestly, they have reformed my 
    <br>life, they have changed my life
    <br>to another level because I 
    <br>was homeless before.
    <br>I had nowhere to sleep, nowhere to lay my head.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN hoping to be prayed for and be delivered, out of this problem.
    <br>On Sunday, the first week of September, I was here.
    <br>The man of God came to me and prophesied that I was homeless.
    <br>He asked me what had happened to my former house.
    <br>I was shocked because the prophecy was very correct.
    <br>100% correct.
    <br>You are homeless.
    <br>That is, there is no house.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>And you paid money somewhere and they refused to give you a receipt.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Okay, don't worry. What happened to your former house?
    <br>It was burned by neighbours.
    <br>It was as if he had entered my mind to because that was what brought me here.
    <br>I was homeless because they burnt my house.
    <br>I had been roaming about with nowhere to stay, sleeping in a classroom
    <br>where I was reposted as a teacher.
    <br>The prophecy is very correct.
    <br>I was afraid but the day that I received the prophecy,
    <br>I was relieved that my problem was solved.
    <br>I was happy, jumping that my problem had been solved.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, the man of God gave me the sum of 1 million naira, three bags of rice
    <br>and a copy of 'The Mirror'.
    <br>I was shocked because I never expected this.
    <br>I was glorifying God for my prophecy, that my problem was solved.
    <br>I didn't know he would follow it up to this extent.
    <br>The follow-up was a surprise to me.
    <br>I was shocked and happy.
    <br>I didn't expect that.
    <br>My mind is like that of a new-born baby.
    <br>After that, he also told the
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners to assist.
    <br>and a lot of them came out and contributed.
    <br>The man of God also presented it
    <br> to me - an additional two million naira,
    <br>apart from the one million naira he had given me.
    <br>I am now the owner of 3,000,000 naira from my daddy,
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>I am so happy; the follow-up he did is too much for me.
    <br>I never expected this.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank Prophet T. B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>for all their hospitality and kind gestures towards me.
    <br>They have changed my life not only materially but also spiritually,
    <br>because since being here, I have been receiving prayer, attending Bible class.
    <br>and praying all the time. I am now really 
    <br>born again.
    <br>I am now closer to God and I will
    <br> never go back again in my life.
    <br>Nothing will make me go back again because I have seen that
    <br>a person who is in the Lord has everything
    <br>and in the Lord, everything will come, even in a way you did not expect.
    <br>More blessings are coming from God.
    <br>God is my beginning and end.
    <br>I have given my life wholeheartedly to God from today henceforth.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>We are advising you to live your 
    <br>life to please God.
    <br>You are healed, delivered and
    <br>blessed to stay and follow Christ.
    <br>God Almighty will strengthen you to follow Him in truth and in His way in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen. I am a child of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for blessing me,
    <br>for using Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV Partners for 
    <br>blessing me spiritually and materially.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My advice to the world is that you should hold on to God anyhwere you are
    <br>and in every situation because you with God are majority.
    <br>Don't give up because you say that you don't have anybody.
    <br>You with God are majority.
    <br>As Christians, remember that in the 
    <br>world that cares less, we should care more
    <br>because whatever you give to the relief of the poor
    <br>and for God's support, that you give unto God.
    <br>This is a remarkable day in the life of Mrs Josephine Iweke
    <br>as she says, Thank You, Jesus, for everything.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
