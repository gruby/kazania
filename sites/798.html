    <br>Faith is natural.
    <br>If something is natural, it means, with God.
    <br>If faith is natural, how do you receive that faith?
    <br>You do not need greater faith; you need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
    <br>All you need to know is His faithfulness and trustworthiness, which you have received today.
    <br>"Be healed; be delivered; be set free" just like that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The moment you know God is faithful and reliable, your faith grows spontaneously.
    <br>With what you have seen now the faith will begin to increase in you.
    <br>Faith in God.
    <br>If you were a "zero" before seeing it, you realise that you begin to have that desire just naturally.
    <br>The moment you realise that God is faithful, reliable and trustworthy, your faith grows spontaneously.
    <br>The moment you realise that God is reliable, your find yourself trusting in Him.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to believe that you are a man and a woman of faith.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>If I am talking - let me see your hand.
    <br>Now, you know what faith is.
    <br>Someone might say, "Until I read the Bible from the Genesis to the end.
    <br>I have not been going to the church; I don't have faith.
    <br>I'm not a bishop, I'm not an evangelist. This is my first time coming to church." - No.
    <br>The issue of faith - faith is natural.
    <br>Listen; you do not need greater faith.
    <br>All you need is faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
    <br>What you have been seeing now shows that God is reliable.
    <br>The moment you realise that God is faithful and reliable, you find that your faith grows naturally.
    <br>When you leave here, you will go to your bedroom, go on your knees and start praying.
    <br>And it has not been like that before.
    <br>It shows that you began to trust someone, who is wiser than you, more clever and more trustworthy than you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Something is growing now.
    <br>Something is growing.
    <br>Allow this to grow.
    <br>Anointing is the power of God.
    <br>The dividend of that power is what you have been seeing today.
    <br>The fruit of that power brings healing, salvation.
    <br>You see people getting healed, those who were crying for many years - just like that.
    <br>It was just a tap, not a slap.
    <br>If I slapped you you would feel it, "Man of God; you slapped me."
    <br>It was a tap.
    <br>There is a difference between tap and slap.
    <br>When you are fighting your neighbour - you slap
    <br>but when you tap - you tap a friend.
    <br>You slap your enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If it was a slap; how many people I would be able to slap before getting tired?
    <br>Try to slap three people and see how would you feel.
    <br>You would get tired.
    <br>But you can tap a "trillion" people...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, if it was to be a traditional way of praying...
    <br>The traditional way of praying is this.
    <br>In the name of Jesus - be healed.
    <br>How many people could I do this to?
    <br>Even the voice, "In the name of Jesus".
    <br>You will get tired after ten minutes.
    <br>OK, let me try.
    <br>In the name of Jesus - you are healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the name of Jesus - be healed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the name of Jesus - be healed.
    <br>The person talking now Mr T.B. Joshua, not Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>If it was a Prophet you would fly.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know I am a brother just like you.
    <br>It is not a Prophet who is talking now.
    <br>That is why I can touch you, "In the name of Jesus - be healed, in Jesus' name".
    <br>The method God has given me - look at it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>It is just like that.
    <br>I do not know how many...
    <br>If you say I should now carry on... that you know what I am saying.
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>This is crazy.
    <br>It is the light we carry.
    <br>Once you light this candle you just touch.
    <br>You just say once, "In the name of Jesus" - you can do the whole...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>If I now begin to say, "In the name of Jesus - be healed"...
    <br>It is only one call that Jesus heard out of three of my calls.
    <br>It is an unbelief that made us to call that name for several hours.
    <br>If you understand let me see your hand.
    <br>Now, "In the name of Jesus -
    <br>be healed."
    <br>How many times?
    <br>Five times.
    <br>If that healing comes it was only once Jesus heard our call.
    <br>Other four...
    <br>Because that came our of unbelief.
    <br>It is just like a human being; if I come to my mummy here now, "Mummy, mummy, mummy".
    <br>By the time mummy hears...
    <br>She would only hear once and say, "Yes! What do you want?"
    <br>She would not begin to answer me three times, "Mummy - yes. Mummy - yes. Mummy - yes".
    <br>Mother would say that something is wrong.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are our challenges.
    <br>We have them a lot.
    <br>When it comes to the things of the spirit we are all babies.
    <br>We that are working for God; there is so much fights in the church because we do not understand ourselves.
    <br>The journey is so difficult; we don't understand.
    <br>You don't even know if a given person is a man of God.
    <br>You, man of God, you don't know if another man of God is a true one.
    <br>Can you see how difficult the journey is?
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>Let me give you a good example, come brothers.
    <br>Stand here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are all ministers of God.
    <br>Could you believe that we may not even know that we are all ministers of God?
    <br>This one might not know that that one is a child of God like him, and he would be fighting him.
    <br>While this one too will continue to fight him...
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>What is the cause of this?
    <br>Why we don't even know ourselves?
    <br>Why?
    <br>It is because we don't know the strength of the ministry.
    <br>The strength of the ministry is not the crowd.
    <br>The strength of the ministry is not the number of people who worship
    <br>or the number of branches you have all over the world.
    <br>The strength of the ministry is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are many ministries of God that have five members and they are more anointed
    <br>then some ministries of God that have the biggest crowd in the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The fact that they know you all over the world does not mean that you are the most anointed person.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The fact that your ministry is known all over the world does not mean
    <br>you are the most anointed person in the world.
    <br>Men of God - they don't know that.
    <br>The fact that your church is the biggest one in the world does not mean that you are the most anointed person.
    <br>There are some ministries of five members that are more anointed than you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The moment we know this, there would be no more fights.
    <br>We are running for members.
    <br>Everybody is trying to have the largest church in the world.
    <br>Everybody is trying to have branches everywhere.
    <br>Everybody is trying to have crowd, to be known.
    <br>Everybody is trying to be known all over the world.
    <br>This is the cause of fight.
    <br>We disregard the truth; the principle.
    <br>OK, if the ministry with the largest number of branches is the most anointed,
    <br>why The SCOAN is only in Ikotun-Egbe and it is known all over the world?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Here, in Ikotun-Egbe - a small village, there is only an arrow that links to the church,
    <br>and it is known all over the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We refuse to advertise our program in any channel, apart from Emmanuel TV.
    <br>You will not see the signboards anywhere in the world.
    <br>When you come here you will not see signboards showing the direction to the church.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We will never look for you if you don't come to the church.
    <br>Nobody will want to know your house and begin to disturb you, "Why did you not come to church?
    <br>What is the problem. You have to come to church. OK?"
    <br>You don't need to collect any letter if you want to leave this ministry
    <br>because I had never asked you for any letter before you came here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are talking about the strength of the ministry.
    <br>The strength of the ministry.
    <br>Once we know that - no problem.
    <br>Thank you brothers.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God has given us adverts.
    <br>God has given His ministry adverts.
    <br>Every living ministry has free adverts.
    <br>What you see about me is an advert to me.
    <br>When you leave here.
    <br>If you leave here today, tomorrow you go to the town and say, "That man is a devil, it is not a man of God" -
    <br>you are advertising me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Or tomorrow you just leave here and say, "That church - don't go there. They used to tie people down.
    <br>It is a bad church."
    <br>You are indirectly advertising me.
    <br>Because the people you are telling it to will want to confirm if they truly tie people down.
    <br>By the time they come and find out that people are not tied down - they become members.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have been using this advert for many years.
    <br>People don't know.
    <br>This is why I don't have sign posts.
    <br>No boards.
    <br>You cannot see signposts outside.
    <br>This an advert God has been giving me for past 30 years.
    <br>God said, "Don't have any signposts, signboards. People will advertise your ministry to the world."
    <br>Free of charge.
    <br>Thank you for your adverts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, you too; leave the truth to defend itself.
    <br>Let people advertise you.
    <br>Don't fight, whatever people say about you.
    <br>If truly you are genuine, whether they condemn you or spoil your name - it is for your good.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take your time.
    <br>Just ask yourself what brought you here.
    <br>You will know that what people had said about me brought you here.
    <br>You are here to confirm.
    <br>And that confirmation will lead you to our friendship.
    <br>We will soon become friends.
    <br>Don't fight.
    <br>Take it easy.
    <br>What people say about your business,
    <br>what people say about your family,
    <br>what people say about your life out there - is for your good.
    <br>If truly you are sent by God it will turn around to favour you.
