  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, at God's time healing happens,
    <br>deliverance happens and salvation takes place.
    <br>It is God's time for your miracle!
    <br>Allow God's Word to live in you,
    <br>to get into your blood
    <br>and grow to gain supremacy over you
    <br>as you prepare your hearts to join Prophet T.B. Joshua in prayer
    <br>to bring about the kind of conversion
    <br>that comes from the Living Word
    <br>and receive the breakthrough
    <br>that will make you forget the pain of the past,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>GET READY FOR REVIVAL!!!

    <br>I say to you, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>whatever situation you are in, trust Jesus.
    <br>Trust Jesus.
    <br>Trust Jesus for your healing.
    <br>Right now, disease, sickness, affliction in your life -
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command them out of your system!
    <br>Say: Out of my system!
    <br>You affliction,
    <br>you infirmity,
    <br>disease,
    <br>sickness in my fluid,
    <br>in my tendons,
    <br>in my blood,
    <br>out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
