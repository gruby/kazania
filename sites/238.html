    <br>How God Talks To You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>I want you to recognise something:
    <br>healing, deliverance, redemption - these are not brought to pass by anything done by us.
    <br>It appears that all is of grace.
    <br>Of all graces, faith honours Christ the most.
    <br>Of all graces, Christ honours faith the most.
    <br>Recognise this.
    <br>How God Talks To You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Those things you believe are impossible - that is exactly what faith demands for.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I'm under His eye,
    <br>I know the protection I am under."
    <br>I'm under His eye!  Let me see your excitement.
