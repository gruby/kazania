  <p>    
    <br>In the midst of physical and economic oppression...
    <br>Nothing is working out; everything around me is just failure.
    <br>Even our friends... this is my friend.
    <br>Everywhere is empty.
    <br>I'm back from the Library!
    <br>- Guess what?
    <br>- Guess what! What is the point?
    <br>The company I work for as a manager has gone bankrupt.
    <br>And you know what? They reduced the workers by 50 per cent.
    <br>They retained me but I was told I would only work three days a week, at a reduced salary.
    <br>This cannot meet up with my responsibilities.
    <br>Well, you know I am a last-stage student and I can't even graduate!
    <br>I can't even feed my children!
    <br>I cannot put fuel in the car to go to work.
    <br>You don't understand; I have taken my graduate exam three times - failure, failure, failure!
    <br>I have had miscarriages three times now.
    <br>Miscarriages? I can't even get married!
    <br>And now, the sickness has come and school has closed.
    <br>Do you know what? This is just too much for me.
    <br>I have started having depression; even thoughts of committing suicide keep coming to my mind.
    <br>It is terrible.
    <br>I'm frustrated; my dreams are shattered; I am getting older every day.
    <br>I'm tired of this world.
    <br>DON’T QUIT!!! | Motivational Message | TB Joshua
    <br>Hello!
    <br>Who is that? Oh no, the rent!
    <br>The door is wide open, this is a shared property, and I am hearing your noise all the way down the hallway.
    <br>Can someone please tell me what on earth is going on?
    <br>What is going on? There is no money for the rent because there is no job,
    <br>everything is falling apart and everything around me is just failure.
    <br>So, please come back later.
    <br>- It's OK.
    <br>- It's OK?
    <br>Really, it is OK, it is not the end of the world.
    <br>Stop lamenting over your failures.
    <br>Let us watch a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua and listen to what he has to say about it.
    <br>DON’T QUIT!!! | Motivational Message | TB Joshua
    <br>Don't Quit - Dig Deep And Fight It Through
    <br>The enemies we feel when we have failed are discouragement, depression,
    <br>embarrassment, shame and hopelessness.
    <br>Don't quit. Dig deep and fight it through!
    <br>If you don't quit when you fail, you will ultimately succeed in life.
    <br>As a baby who is learning how to walk,
    <br>you start by hitting every piece of furniture in the house.
    <br>You fall and get up,
    <br>then fall again and get up again until you master your balance.
    <br>Life is like that.
    <br>We have to continue to keep getting up any time we fail.
    <br>Keep looking forward.
    <br>Don't waste your time lamenting your past record, past failure.
    <br>We often succeed through failure.
    <br>Failure is a test for our maturity.
    <br>We have a goal to reach that needs all of our energy.
    <br>True failure lies not in falling down.
    <br>You only truly fail when you stop getting back up and trying again.
    <br>These Bible passages will help you further.
    <br>Romans 8:35-39,
    <br>1 Corinthians 3:1-3,
    <br>Hebrews 12:1-3,
    <br>Galatians 4:1-7,
    <br>and Jeremiah 8:4.
    <br>Thank you.
