  <p>    
    <br>On a weekly basis, The SCOAN receives hundreds of visitors from around the world.
    <br>They come to the church for a spiritual retreat and to seek the face of God, for solution
    <br>to various challenges they may be having.
    <br>They come to where they have seen the Word of God working in the Spirit.
    <br>These visitors, who have just arrived from the international airport, after being picked up
    <br>and driven to the church, are walking into the entrance of The SCOAN to be received.
    <br>As the visitors step off the buses, one visitor begins to run
    <br>as the evil spirits within her instantly begin to manifest.
    <br>Let's watch what happened next.
    <br>Let me kill you - T.B. Joshua, I came to you today!
    <br>I am an ancestral spirit.
    <br>How many of you are in this body?
    <br>We are 65 demons.
    <br>Name them.
    <br>We are so many – Lucifer.
    <br>Number two?
    <br>Subian.
    <br>Number three?
    <br>Maymona.
    <br>Number four?
    <br>Jabaal.
    <br>What have you done to her, you 65 demons?
    <br>We sleep with her.
    <br>We ate her uterus; we don’t want her to bear a child.
    <br>What have you done to her family, her career?
    <br>Her family – we killed her husband.
    <br>Why did you kill her husband?
    <br>We don't want her to be married.
    <br>We gave her diabetes and HIV; through an operation, we gave her the HIV virus.
    <br>My mission is not this lady, I want to destroy the man of God.
    <br>Which man of God?
    <br>T.B. (Joshua)
    <br>International Visitors Arrive At The SCOAN
    <br>He delivers people; even this lady is going to be delivered.
    <br>We don’t want that because this lady, when she is delivered, she will be the finger of God.
    <br>We don’t want to hear these foolish things – she has already started.
    <br>Oo, terribly!
    <br>Speak out, demon!
    <br>Terribly!
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>F_ck you.
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>F_ck you.
    <br>You must speak!
    <br>F_ck you.
    <br>Which man of God you want to destroy?
    <br>Speak out, demon!
    <br>Man of the house.
    <br>Man of "tuberculosis".
    <br>Which man of God?
    <br>Name him.
    <br>No!
    <br>Why don't you want to say his name?
    <br>You don’t see the fire?
    <br>I made a mistake.
    <br>When I arrived, I made a mistake – I was planning to hide until she got back to Tanzania
    <br>but she kneeled down to obey your God, that's why I am now chained.
    <br>You are chained?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, I don’t want to go myself, I want to go with the man of God.
    <br>Why do you want to destroy the man of God?
    <br>The man of God wants to deliver this crowd here.
    <br>Which crowd?
    <br>You mean the people here?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can't you see?
    <br>So, because he wants to deliver this crowd, people that came here, that's why you came here to destroy...
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Also this lady – why?
    <br>The purpose – to have an accident through the flight today.
    <br>Speak louder!
    <br>To have an accident through the flight today.
    <br>There were so many people from South Africa and Tanzania.
    <br>I wanted to kill them.
    <br>Jesus came and rescued the plane.
    <br>The plane took about 30 minutes before--
    <br>International Visitors Arrive At The SCOAN
    <br>You said what?
    <br>The plane lost direction for about 30 minutes in the air.
    <br>OK, those of you who arrived in that plane now -
    <br>we just want one or two to come out and explain this incident.
    <br>Yeah, I noticed this issue.
    <br>About 30 minutes before landing, I started thanking God thinking that we were landing.
    <br>I praised Jesus; I praised God but it didn't land.
    <br>I then started asking myself, "Why is it taking time to land?"
    <br>It was me – I am the lucifer.
    <br>What was your plan about the plane?
    <br>I always need blood!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>When we were just about to land, something happened -
    <br>the flight was shaking uncontrollably.
    <br>I asked myself, "Is it turbulence? What is it? Is it because it was raining when we arrived?"
    <br>This is a serious issue.
    <br>I wanted to cause shame for T.B. Joshua for the second time but I failed.
    <br>Which one was the first?
    <br>Speak louder!
    <br>Do you remember?
    <br>Say it!
    <br>Did you forget?
    <br>Say it!
    <br>South Africa.
    <br>It was me; we drink blood!
    <br>So, the reason for crashing the plane was to take blood?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Speak louder!
    <br>Yes, in the kingdom.
    <br>Even her blood because she did not obey our instruction.
    <br>I told her not to serve your Lord but she refused.
    <br>I am powerless but I want to kill.
    <br>The international visitors are shocked by the confession of the demons they just heard.
    <br>They learnt that where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>That Sunday anointing was in the house.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua moved around mightily, in the power of the Holy Ghost, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the lightning power of God dispelled all shades of darkness in people's lives.
    <br>Here, the lady receives her own touch separating her from the evil spirits that once tormented her life.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Beatha.
    <br>I came from Tanzania.
    <br>I thank God for my deliverance which I got last week.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>When I was about 5 to 6 years old, I started having bad dreams,
    <br>seeing insects, snakes and eating in the dream; things went bad in my life.
    <br>There was a time when my mum told me to go to a shop.
    <br>I took just a few minutes.
    <br>When my mother blinked her eyes, I had already run out.
    <br>The distance was far from our house.
    <br>I'm sorry to cut you, madam.
    <br>What you are explaining is that right from a young age, you began having these very strange nightmares.
    <br>Can you just describe for us again what were you seeing in the dreams, right from a young age?
    <br>In the dreams, I used to see snakes and insects,
    <br>eating in the dreams and being chased by snakes.
    <br>As you became older, what began to happen to you?
    <br>How did these spirits begin to affect your life negatively?
    <br>It affected my life.
    <br>When I was 7, my father had two wives.
    <br>He asked me and my little sister to live in my stepmother's house.
    <br>During that period, my stepmother used to wash me in the middle of the doorway in a big basin
    <br>while I was still wearing my underwear.
    <br>She dug a grave in which she put the particles from my body together with my underwear and began to chant.
    <br>So, at a very young age your stepmother actually did a ritual
    <br>whereby she washed you inside of this occultic basin and actually used all of the residue from
    <br>that water on your clothing, items and put it inside a grave and made some incantations.
    <br>This is how from a young age these evil spirits began to afflict your life.
    <br>As you became older, what were the things that you began to experience?
    <br>I started my menstrual period late; when I was between 22 and 24, I had my first menstruation.
    <br>Six months after that, I started having abdominal pain
    <br>and my stomach became swollen like a six months pregnancy.
    <br>My aunt – my father's sister – is a doctor.
    <br>She said that she needed to operate on me to see what was inside my womb.
    <br>When it was close to the day of the operation, I dreamt of a big snake coming out of my private part
    <br>and it entered my aunt and she swallowed it.
    <br>In the morning, I told my mother and father about the dream but they didn’t understand.
    <br>I went to the theatre that day and my operation took about 12 hours.
    <br>The doctor who I saw in the dream swallowing the snake started fighting other doctors
    <br>who were in the theatre.
    <br>The fight was too much according to what they told me.
    <br>There were four doctors but she chased the other three out.
    <br>Only my aunt remained and she cut my uterus and ate it.
    <br>They saw this from the window.
    <br>After 30 minutes, my aunt came to my side in another room and told me three things.
    <br>She asked, "Are you OK?"
    <br>I said, "I am OK".
    <br>She told me, "You are not going to have your own child as I have swallowed all your babies.
    <br>Secondly, you cannot be married and thirdly, you are going to be sick".
    <br>This is what she told you physically?
    <br>This was what she told me physically after the doctors had told me about the incident.
    <br>We can understand how these evil spirits really had entered our sister's life and afflicted her,
    <br>right from her tender age.
    <br>Sister, just tell us, as you were growing up, what actually happened, for example in the area of your marriage.
    <br>Tell us what happened when you tried to go into a marriage.
    <br>Due to my desire to have children, I decided to get married but I didn't stay in my martial home;
    <br>I went home after six months.
    <br>Then, I got married to another man who later passed away after three years of marriage.
    <br>So, both attempts to get married, the first marriage - you left the man just after 6 months,
    <br>the second marriage - the man actually passed on just after a couple of years of marriage.
    <br>And you were unable to have children in both marriages?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK, just tell us about your career.
    <br>How did these evil spirits really affect you in your career as a medical doctor?
    <br>It affected me.
    <br>Sometimes in my working place, I used to see dead people coming from everywhere.
    <br>It meant I should be there to satisfy the dead, in order to go to the mortuary.
    <br>This happened frequently in my life.
    <br>My career was nothing.
    <br>I had nothing in my hand.
    <br>We want to understand clearly.
    <br>You mean as a medical doctor when you were in the hospital, as you were on shift,
    <br>you would see the people that had died?
    <br>You would actually physically see the spirits of those dead people?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK, we can just once again--
    <br>Brethren, we are just asking these questions to understand how our sister was really being tormented
    <br>by these evil spirits that possessed her right from a very tender age and how it destroyed her marriage,
    <br>health, family, career, everything about her, even as a medical doctor.
    <br>Madam, we thank God that you came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Can you just tell us how did you decide to come here to The SCOAN
    <br>and what happened when you decided to come here?
    <br>Before then, I adopted a child but the spirit didn't allow me to live peacefully with the child.
    <br>I used to beat her.
    <br>I thank God because as I started watching Emmanuel TV, I decided to come here.
    <br>Three weeks before coming here, I was kidnapped.
    <br>All my ATM cards were blocked and they withdrew the money from both my accounts.
    <br>By the grace of God, I had already paid for my ticket to come here.
    <br>OK, so we want to clearly understand what our sister is saying.
    <br>She is saying that several months ago she started watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and made the decision to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Once it was confirmed that she would come, she began to experience a strange attack.
    <br>She said that actually her credit cards were all stolen
    <br>and people actually began to take money from her bank accounts.
    <br>You mean, sister, that every attempt was made to try to stop you from coming to The SCOAN, is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is exactly to confirm what the man of God said that once you make a decision to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>we know that anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>This was the attack our sister actually experienced before she came here.
    <br>Madam, tell us, on the journey here, when you were on the plane, can you describe to us what happened?
    <br>In the plane, I started feeling very bad and I started praying and read Psalm 51 three times.
    <br>I told the lady sitting beside me, "This plane is not going to land safely. Please, can you pray?"
    <br>She said, "I am praying".
    <br>I said, "No. I didn’t see your mouth praying".
    <br>I was just suffering.
    <br>For about 30 to 35 minutes, the plane was not able to land.
    <br>The plane went down and up several times.
    <br>When the plane finally reached the airport, it landed that way and nearly went off-track.
    <br>We thank God because if it was not for your prayers
    <br>and the prayers of Prophet T.B. Joshua, we don't know where we would be.
    <br>I hope we have listened what our sister is saying.
    <br>This was the experience as she actually physically travelled here to The SCOAN.
    <br>We saw on the clip earlier how the demon within our sister actually confessed that he had planned
    <br>to cause a very serious accident with a plane, that was actually bringing hundreds of pilgrims
    <br>here to The SCOAN from different countries.
    <br>But glory be to God Almighty that our sister is here in our midst.
    <br>She has been completely delivered from that evil spirit.
    <br>Now, sister, when you physically came to The SCOAN and arrived at the church -
    <br>can you just describe what happened?
    <br>Before coming here, I prayed that before entering the church premises, I wanted to kneel down
    <br>and obey the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua because of what I had witnessed on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That was what I did but after that, I couldn't remember what was going on.
    <br>The last thing you remember is just kneeling down to pray as you arrived in the church
    <br>and after that, you can't remember what happened next?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Everything we saw on the clip, what we are seeing now, that manifestation, the confession of that demon,
    <br>you had no idea what was happening at that moment?
    <br>None at all.
    <br>Brethren, we can see that truly this was a spiritual deliverance that was taking place
    <br>and our sister was afflicted by that demon that had planned to use her to cause so much destruction,
    <br>not only in her life but in the lives of the hundreds that actually came to The SCOAN.
    <br>But to the glory of God that spirit was defeated and today our sister is here in our midst.
    <br>Sister, we know that after this encounter whereby that evil spirit was exposed and was chained,
    <br>on Sunday Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>Tell us - ever since then, what are the changes that you have seen in your life?
    <br>I have peace in my heart.
    <br>I used medication for diabetes but since I came here, I could eat rice without feeling anything.
    <br>I am strong.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I want to sing a song.
    <br>OK, just before the song, madam, you said that before you were having these terrible nightmares,
    <br>seeing snakes, different insects, animals--
    <br>Ever since you came here, how have you been sleeping?
    <br>I sleep well like a baby.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We have heard it from our sister here; physically, her health has been restored.
    <br>We heard how the demon confessed that it had caused so many sicknesses in her body.
    <br>But she said that since she has arrived here, she has been healthy, eating any type of food,
    <br>not taking the medication she once depended on.
    <br>And spiritually as well, she is having peace in her heart, and she has been sleeping so well,
    <br>to the glory of God Almighty.
    <br>Madam, we know in your own case, you just entered the church and your deliverance happened.
    <br>What is your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world and those who are present here?
    <br>If you are not able to come here, you can touch the Emmanuel TV screen at home.
    <br>Just put your faith in Jesus Christ and He will take all your problems away.
    <br>I thank the Lord.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
