  <p>    
    <br>Right now open your lips; open the door of your heart.
    <br>Thou power of deliverance!
    <br>Everyone that is here today, I speak to your heart and soul.
    <br>Every demonic activity within and outside you, I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Demonic activity, in the name of Jesus - out of my life!
    <br>Begin to command them out!
    <br>Command them out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ !
    <br>She is my daughter. Deliver her for me, Man of God!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am the woman in the water.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>I don't know him. I am nobody to him.
    <br>What do you want to say now?
    <br>She's my daughter.
    <br>He says you are his daughter.
    <br>I'm not his daughter.
    <br>Who is he?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>Stand up and look at his face.
    <br>It's because the one inside of her is the one talking.
    <br>The life you people live is a hopeless life - life without the power of God.
    <br>Look at your daughter. She is saying that she doesn't know you.
    <br>Assuming you had been living in line with the power,
    <br>she would not face you to say that she doesn't know you
    <br>and you gave birth to her.
    <br>Where did you meet the mother?
    <br>I met her in Maiduguri, Borno State.
    <br>The whole thing started from the connection where you people met.
    <br>It wasn't an issue of marriage but later resulted to it.
    <br>At the beginning, it was a different thing.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I'm the woman in the water.
    <br>How come about the woman in the water? Who is your father then?
    <br>I don't have a father.
    <br>Who is your mother?
    <br>I don't have a mother.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I don't have an age.
    <br>Touch your daughter.
    <br>I don't know this man.
    <br>Carry your daughter.
    <br>Your father has carried you.
    <br>I said he is not my father.
    <br>- But somebody is carrying you. 
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Who is he? 
    <br>- I don't know him.
    <br>Somebody you don't know, you allowed the person to carry you.
    <br>Why can't you disappear?
    <br>I am in somebody's body.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>For you to know that she is not a small girl.
    <br>She is telling me things of the spirit. She said, ''I'm in somebody's body''.
    <br>He is not carrying the real body that is talking.
    <br>She says he cannot carry the real body. The real body is somewhere.
    <br>But the body he is carrying is just an ordinary body.
    <br>But it is somebody's body.
    <br>She knows what she is saying. She is not a kid.
    <br>Say, ''In the name of Jesus'' and put her on the floor.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>DEMONS Are Real: Little Girl POSSESSED!!!
    <br>The job is done. She is running from her father now.
    <br>If you go near to her, she will run. Go near her.
    <br>Because you have done something now. Run after her!
    <br>Call her now!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Because she cannot go near him.
    <br>Before now, she tossed you like bread. You used to see her in your dreams.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Now, she cannot go near you.
    <br>She will not be able to go home with you unless she is delivered.
    <br>What she is seeing now is light. She is afraid.
    <br>You can't carry her again because she will not even follow you unless she is delivered.
    <br>Because you are not for her again.
    <br>Go and wait there.
    <br>This is what everybody needs.
    <br>Go this way!
    <br>Go and meet your dad!
    <br>Meet your dad!
    <br>Move close.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Vivian Prince Wilson.
    <br>I'm from Nigeria but residing in South Africa.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my dad.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was that
    <br>I was possessed with the spirit of witchcraft.
    <br>It all started when we visited a woman in 2009.
    <br>She offered us a drink and since then, I'd been seeing a demon following me.
    <br>There was a time we were watching the news and a man had a plane crash
    <br>and survived by drinking his own urine.
    <br>After that, I went to the toilet but my dad never knew what I had in mind to do.
    <br>When I got there, that demon told me that I should urinate in a bowl and drink.
    <br>I did so and flushed an empty toilet.
    <br>Since that time, I had been drinking my own urine.
    <br>The demon also pushed me to eat my hair, pick my nose
    <br>and eat the wax from my ears.
    <br>That made me to also start biting my finger nails.
    <br>By that time, I was very big and fat.
    <br>As you can see now, I have lost so much weight.
    <br>The demon pushed me into doing so many things that affected my dad's career.
    <br>By now, he was supposed to be in England but because I was possessed
    <br>with the spirit of witchcraft, I made it not to happen.
    <br>Anytime he picked me from school, I would always look dirty.
    <br>I was also addicted to eating sand.
    <br>That demon liked everywhere to be dirty.
    <br>It went to the extent that I could stay two months without taking my shower.
    <br>My mum would force me to take a shower before I would agree.
    <br>Even when I would be taking a shower, I would be very angry with her.
    <br>Glory be to God, I have been delivered!
    <br>Since my deliverance, I've been relating with my parents and younger ones.
    <br>That spirit gave me the spirit of anger.
    <br>Anytime my mother or father would talk to me, I would get angry at them and abuse them.
    <br>Now, I am relating with them and I am very light.
    <br>And I have lost so much weight.
    <br>I thank God for delivering me.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Prince Wilson Olomu.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian based in South Africa.
    <br>As you have seen in the clip, that day was a wonderful day in my life.
    <br>It started in South Africa when we were watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>when the man of God was praying during the mass prayer.
    <br>My daughter started manifesting; she started vomiting and coughing.
    <br>I confronted her and asked, ''Who are you? What is wrong with you?''
    <br>Then the evil spirit in her started speaking and said a lot of things.
    <br>I decided to bring her to The SCOAN for proper deliverance.
    <br>The day we came, what happened is what you saw in the clip.
    <br>There were a lot of things happening to her before her deliverance.
    <br>She was eating a lot of things which human beings don't eat.
    <br>She ate the hair of every part of her body, sniffed petrol and ate dirt -
    <br>she ate a lot of things human beings don't eat.
    <br>That caused her to be fat as you saw in the clip.
    <br>A lot of problems happened in my marriage and career.
    <br>She was very aggressive to her younger ones
    <br>and would always see her mother as her rival and not as her mother.
    <br>She hated her mum; she hated me as well.
    <br>She would always appear to me in my dreams, attacking me in various ways.
    <br>She would attack my career as well.
    <br>You brought her here after the spirit within her manifested when watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Now we've seen what happened in the clip.
    <br>Tell us, ever since this deliverance, what are the changes?
    <br>Since her deliverance, there have been a lot of changes in the entire family
    <br>and in her life as well.
    <br>Any day I am not at home, she is like the father in the house.
    <br>She takes care of her mum and younger ones.
    <br>She does things that you would know truly, deliverance has taken place in her life
    <br>and God has imparted to her divine wisdom
    <br>that she behaves like a normal child ought to behave.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So you mean ever since then your daughter has been behaving completely normally,
    <br>she's very intelligent in school, she's now loving the family
    <br>and behaving completely like a normal child?
    <br>Yes, sir. And I have a clip of how she looks now.
    <br>This is the very person you saw in the clip.
    <br>Wow! Thank You, Jesus Christ. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>You said before, she used to eat many strange things,
    <br>she used to attack you in the dream. Tell us, have all of those things stopped?
    <br>Yes, all those things have stopped.
    <br>Presently, she is the neatest in the family.
    <br>Anything dirty seriously irritates her as a result of her deliverance.
    <br>As a result of this deliverance, there is a lot of peace in my marriage now and in my career.
    <br>As a result of that deliverance, I was able to have my own house
    <br>in South Africa which I bought without owing anything.
    <br>My family and I are able to have a permanent residence in South Africa.
    <br>I can show you the picture of my family.
    <br>This is the certificate of the proof of our permanent residence in South Africa.
    <br>The whole family.
    <br>This is my ID from South Africa.
    <br>My career has been great after the deliverance.
    <br>Before the deliverance, my legs were swollen
    <br>and I could not even use them as a soccer player.
    <br>But after the deliverance, when I went back home,
    <br>without using any medication, everything went back to normal
    <br>and I was restored the way God had created me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! We can just hear the blessings that God has brought into this family.
    <br>Sir, you even said that as we saw in the clip, your daughter was very fat
    <br>because of the things she was eating and how this evil spirit was occupying her body.
    <br>But right now, how is her health and her body?
    <br>She is perfectly well in terms of her health now.
    <br>Regarding her body, you have seen the picture of her -
    <br>how she looks slim and tall.
    <br>Ok, we can see again here the picture of that little girl we saw manifesting earlier
    <br>and indeed, this is the evidence that Jesus Christ has completely delivered her.
    <br>Some years after the deliverance, you can see that she is completely back to normal.
    <br>We give all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>My advice to viewers around the world and the people present here
    <br>is that as a parent, when the man of God is praying,
    <br>don't concentrate only on yourself or your wife.
    <br>The children are very important. Bring them around you
    <br>because the devil is a very trickish spirit; he will take them away.
    <br>You will think that they are playing
    <br>but satan doesn't want them to receive their deliverance.
    <br>Make sure that they are around you;
    <br>pray with them and you will see the hand of God in their lives.
    <br>My second advice is: viewers all over the world
    <br>and the people present here, let our prayers always be,
    <br>'If God sends the man of God to deliver you,
    <br>may you receive your deliverance anywhere you are
    <br>for distance is not a barrier'.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Indeed, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>We believe our brother's advice is a great encouragement to viewers around the world.
    <br>During the course of today's service, Prophet TB Joshua will begin to pray for the viewers.
    <br>Wherever you are, join by faith, connect with our prayer,
    <br>bring your family together and allow the anointing of God to touch you
    <br>wherever you are in the world and you too will share your own testimony.
    <br>Brother, we encourage you to continue to bring up this beautiful girl and your family
    <br>in the ways of the Lord, and definitely the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
