    <br>Emmanuel TV DRAMA WORKSHOP
    <br>DRAMA - PRAYER IS NOT SAYING WORDS BUT PRAYING PRAYER
    <br>Brother Carter left a note on his door and he said we can come inside, that he will be right back.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>I think it is very good that we have a prayer meeting like this every week
    <br>because of what I am seeing in the news - the situation is getting worse.
    <br>This sickness is causing crisis in the streets.
    <br>People are depressed, they are getting laid off from their jobs, everyone is sad.
    <br>In fact, did you know that many companies have gone bankrupt?
    <br>There are no flights to travel to other countries.
    <br>And even if there is a flight, they want to quarantine you for some days.
    <br>Yes. Imagine if you want to go to Europe, when you get there they will quarantine you for two weeks
    <br>or maybe a month, or who knows?
    <br>If you want to go to America or Africa, it will be absolutely the same.
    <br>DRAMA - PRAYER IS NOT SAYING WORDS BUT PRAYING PRAYER
    <br>You cannot even go for a holiday.
    <br>If you go for a holiday, you are going to spend all your time in quarantine.
    <br>Not only that. Children are not going to school anymore because of fear - fear of education.
    <br>Fear of education? That is the end of our nation.
    <br>That is why there is need for us to gather here today, brethren, for the Lord to intervene.
    <br>DRAMA - PRAYER IS NOT SAYING WORDS BUT PRAYING PRAYER
    <br>The brother that is leading us in prayer has not come and it is getting late.
    <br>What should we do?
    <br>Please, forget all that; we know how to pray, it is in our blood.
    <br>Yes. Lead us in prayer. Let us pray.
    <br>We raise our voices in the name of the Lord.
    <br>We call upon the name of the Lord to intervene in the affairs of nations.
    <br>There is so much crisis.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>DRAMA - PRAYER IS NOT SAYING WORDS BUT PRAYING PRAYER
    <br>Every knee shall bow
    <br>Every tongue confess
    <br>That Jesus Christ is Lord
    <br>DRAMA - PRAYER IS NOT SAYING WORDS BUT PRAYING PRAYER
    <br>Father God Almighty, let the malls open so we can go out and buy new clothes.
    <br>DRAMA - PRAYER IS NOT SAYING WORDS BUT PRAYING PRAYER
    <br>Let this quarantine go, in Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>We need an anti-virus to clean this virus away.
    <br>Let there be peace in the streets.
    <br>All the restaurants, let them be open so we can eat good food.
    <br>DRAMA - PRAYER IS NOT SAYING WORDS BUT PRAYING PRAYER
    <br>What is happening here? What are you doing?
    <br>We are praying!
    <br>Are you sure you are praying, or are you just saying words?
    <br>Because from what I am hearing, you are just saying words.
    <br>The power of God comes not in saying words but in praying prayer.
    <br>Exactly. The wisest man I know said:
    <br>To the extent that you think the thoughts of Christ, to that same extent do you have the power of Christ.
    <br>Let us watch to hear more wise words from T.B. Joshua on this matter.
    <br>Prayer is the key
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Jesus started with prayer
    <br>And ended with prayer
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Prayer is the master key to loose and to bind.
    <br>Prayer is not saying words.
    <br>It is reality.
    <br>It is not talking off into space.
    <br>You hear from God in the measure to which you live, do and practice His Word.
    <br>He is with us in the Living Word.
    <br>Acting on the Word makes Jesus vitally real to the believer.
    <br>For instance, in Mark 16:17 - "In My name, you shall cast out demons."
    <br>This Scripture is useless until we act on the Word.
    <br>This Scripture is dead until we act on the Word.
    <br>It is acting on the Word that builds faith in the believer.
    <br>It is not only reading the Bible and committing it to memory, which is valuable, which is good,
    <br>but it is also letting that Word we are reading become an integral part of our being.
    <br>Faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>Our heart is a landing point, a contact point for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>God is Spirit - in the Book of John 4:24 - and His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>There are three main spirits in the world: God’s Spirit, satan’s spirit and your spirit.
    <br>We are free moral agents;
    <br>we can yield ourselves to either God’s Spirit or the other spirits.
    <br>Whoever we choose to obey, that is whose servant we are.
    <br>The Book of Romans 6:16 says whoever you choose to obey, that is whose servant you are.
    <br>Viewers, if we do not pray to God, who is Spirit, in the Spirit, we will be led by our emotions or intellect.
    <br>I mean, what we read, what we see, what we hear, how we feel and what our circumstances look like.
    <br>If we do not worship God, who is a Spirit, in the Spirit, can we hope to hear or receive from Him?
    <br>God is not a man.
    <br>If we do not worship God in spirit,
    <br>that does not mean we cannot give a powerful message,
    <br>even quote the Bible from Genesis to Revelation flawlessly,
    <br>but without the required power, authority and legitimacy.
    <br>Such was the case of the seven sons of Sceva in Acts 19:11-16.
    <br>How do we pray in spirit and truth?
    <br>We pray in spirit and truth when every purpose and passion of our heart,
    <br>as well as every act of our worship - singing, dancing, counselling, preaching, teaching, offering, prayer -
    <br>is guided and regulated by the Word of God.
    <br>We take Jesus into our day when we take the Living Word.
    <br>So, let us reverence our Spiritual Head - Jesus - in our prayer, in our worship, in everything we do.
    <br>The Spirit of God introduces us into God’s family.
    <br>In Romans 8:26-27, we don't know how to pray.
    <br>The Spirit of God opens our heart to prayer - to what to say.
    <br>That makes prayer the key to loose and to bind.
    <br>Whatever you loose here on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.
    <br>The Spirit of God reconciles us with the Father and renews our life – new direction, new way, new focus.
    <br>He helps us remain faithful, obedient to Christ.
    <br>This is why we say, "Spirit of faithfulness, Spirit of obedience, Spirit of kindness, Spirit of humility."
    <br>No one can be humble, faithful, obedient without the Spirit of God.
    <br>The Spirit of God helps us remain faithful to Christ, even in trials and suffering.
    <br>He is the Word on our lips: Jesus!
    <br>"In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>The Spirit of God is the Word on our lips.
    <br>Prayer is not saying words.
    <br>The Spirit of God is the Word on our lips.
    <br>This is what 1 Corinthians 12:3 says: He is the Word on our lips.
    <br>"Jesus! In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>He is the Word on our lips.
    <br>Anyone can say, "Jesus! In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>But the Spirit of God is the Word on our lips.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, think through us 'til Your ideas become our ideas, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Think through us 'til Your ideas become our ideas, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Act in us, oh Holy Spirit, that our work may be holy!
    <br>Draw our heart that we may love what is holy, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Strengthen us that we may defend what is holy, in Jesus Christ’s name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Guide us that we may remain holy. In Jesus Christ’s name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers, as we have listened, prayer is not saying words.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is the Word on our lips.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>We enter this day with its challenges.
    <br>We enter this day with its problems.
    <br>Direct us, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Protect us, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Protect us, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Nurture us, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Nurture us, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever strange pain in your system, in your organs, in your internal organs, in your bodies -
    <br>whatever strange pain - cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever strange pain in your system,
    <br>whatever strange pain in your internal organs, in your organs,
    <br>whatever strange pain in your body - cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command that pain right now to leave! Leave, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Leave, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus Christ, touch their bodies!
    <br>Touch their system! Touch their internal organs! Touch their organs!
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name we pray!
    <br>Lord Jesus, touch them with Your healing power!
    <br>Touch them with Your healing power, in Jesus Christ’s name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Every obstacle holding you down - I loose you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every obstacle holding you down in the East, South, West, North,
    <br>every obstacle in your business, every obstacle in your career,
    <br>every obstacle - be loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every obstacle holding you down in your business, every obstacle holding you down in your family,
    <br>every obstacle in your finances, every obstacle in your career -
    <br>be loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>By the mercy of God, I can see you free from the prison of failure, from the prison of career failure,
    <br>from the prison of setback, from the prison of deadly disease, killer disease - sickness, affliction!
    <br>I can see you free from their prison, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Viewers, this is a new day for you.
    <br>You can no longer live your way.
    <br>A new day for you!
    <br>I pray the Lord fill you with His faithfulness.
    <br>I pray the Lord fill you with His kindness, obedience,
    <br>a new direction, a new focus, a new way, in Jesus Christ’s name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>This programme is not time-bound. It is anointed every time, all the time, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>For more understanding, read the Books of Matthew 10:19-20, John 16:12-13, 1 Corinthians 12:3,
    <br>1 Corinthians 2:12-13, John 3:30-34, Romans 8:26-27 and John 15:7.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
