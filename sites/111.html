  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities
    <br>which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together,
    <br>in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen, right now.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
    <br>Viewers all over the world and those who are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>I want you to listen to me:
    <br>I want to share this anointing with you -
    <br>it is anointing that sees,
    <br>anointing that heals,
    <br>anointing that blesses,
    <br>anointing that delivers.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be blessed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Where can you go from this anointing -
    <br>the anointing that heals,
    <br>that delivers,
    <br>that blesses?
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>Say: I know His name.
    <br>His name is Healer.
    <br>His name is Deliverer.
    <br>Confess your deliverance.
    <br>Commit your business,
    <br>commit your finances,
    <br>commit your career,
    <br>commit your future,
    <br>commit your marriage,
    <br>commit your destiny -
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to rejoice.
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God
    <br>as you send your testimony.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
