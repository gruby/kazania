    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Mrs Ajibola Adeyanju has come to The SCOAN with the problem of leg cancer.
    <br>At just 37 years old, her leg has begun to swell and deteriorate.
    <br>Imagine the odour that emits from her putrefying skin.
    <br>Imagine the embarrassment she must face in public.
    <br>Imagine the pain she must endure on a daily basis.
    <br>MIRACLE CAUGHT ON CAMERA: Watch A Rotting Leg Heal After Prayer!!!
    <br>God sometimes uses hard times to draw us to Himself,
    <br>so we can take our proper position and possession in Him.
    <br>This difficult circumstance has brought Mrs Ajibola to the presence of God,
    <br>at The SCOAN, where she expects to receive a healing touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's take a moment to hear from her.
    <br>My name is Ajibola Adeyanju.
    <br>What is the problem that brought you to The SCOAN today?
    <br>The problem of leg cancer brought me here today.
    <br>I cannot sleep; I am always in pain and it itches me as if something wants to come out with force.
    <br>I believe that God will meet me at the point of my need.
    <br>What you are about to see in terms of miracles is to glorify the name, Jesus.
    <br>I want you to believe that Jesus is alive!
    <br>Seeing it, accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>She cannot walk; she cannot do anything.
    <br>The answer is amputation but when Jesus says yes, no one can say no!
    <br>- How are you feeling?
    <br>- I am in pain.
    <br>You are in pain.
    <br>The only recommendation doctors could give Mrs Ajibola was amputation
    <br>but Prophet T.B. Joshua begins to perform a spiritual amputation,
    <br>cutting off sin and its penalties from her life, in the powerful name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You can see the instant action and reaction take place,
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua moves his hand under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>causing her leg to move uncontrollably.
    <br>This is a mighty sign and wonder.
    <br>Walk, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Mrs Ajibola supports herself, as strength that she didn't have before returns to her body.
    <br>It is alright.
    <br>Stand right!
    <br>Touch. 
    <br>OK, move.
    <br>Amazingly, Mrs Ajibola stands on her own two feet and begins walking with the leg
    <br>that was once stricken with leg cancer.
    <br>Yes - Jesus Christ heals and still heals all manners of sickness and disease.
    <br>God is the Healer and He has never changed.
    <br>Look!
    <br>I am here and she is over there.
    <br>I will send the Spirit of my Father to her.
    <br>You will see what will happen now.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his hand,
    <br>the Spirit of Jesus Christ completes the spiritual operation, setting her totally free.
    <br>Mrs Ajibola begins to walk normally and majestically to the glory of God.
    <br>Healed Of Leg Cancer
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>All praise be to God.
    <br>Mrs Ajibola came back to The SCOAN to testify to her total healing.
    <br>On the left you can see the terrible condition her leg was once in
    <br>and on the right you can see that her leg has returned to a normal size
    <br>and has been covered with healthy skin.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua said, this miracle was to glorify Jesus,
    <br>for you to believe that Jesus is alive.
    <br>Seeing it should encourage you to make the wisest choice
    <br>and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Jesus Christ receives repentant souls; He loves them and welcomes them.
    <br>The worst of sins can be forgiven.
    <br>I'm feeling fine.
    <br>- Are you still feeling any pain?
    <br>- No, I am OK now. I am feeling OK.
    <br>My name is Ajibola Adeyanju.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN with the problem of leg cancer.
    <br>I woke up one fateful morning and discovered I was feeling pain in my leg.
    <br>We went to several places such as hospitals and native doctors
    <br>in search of a solution but all to no avail.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, instantly, I felt so light and felt no pain.
    <br>He did not collect any money from me.
    <br>The Lord has done it.
    <br>No more pain!
    <br>Healed Of Leg Cancer
    <br>I feel no pain.
