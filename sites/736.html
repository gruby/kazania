    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>This is addiction, pornography.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>You watch pornography.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>And it becomes part of your blood.
    <br>It's true. My wife was complaining, she said that I must stop reading...
    <br>Who?
    <br>My wife. She said that I must stop reading the Bible through my cell phone.
    <br>Whereas you are not reading the Bible, it's pornography you are watching.
    <br>It's true!
    <br>She will be complaining the whole night.
    <br>You see people today, when they say they are reading and it is a different thing.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>Where is your wife?
    <br>She is back in South Africa.
    <br>I will invite her, don't worry. It is not an issue.
    <br>This pornography has destroyed your marriage.
    <br>Thank you, it is true. There is no affection between me and my wife.
    <br>- You see your wife as a shit.
    <br>- It's true.
    <br>- You just see anything bad about her.
    <br>- It's true, Man of God.
    <br>You are too young for that.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Tshiuhombela Tshiridzi Oscar.
    <br>I'm coming from South Africa.
    <br>I am an environmental consultant by profession.
    <br>Before you begin to talk, let me give a handshake to my sister.
    <br>I want to thank you for honouring this invitation.
    <br>And, I mean, ordinarily this woman would not come here.
    <br>Because it's just a phone call, and immediately
    <br>she said, "No, man of God is calling me, I have to be there".
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The person beside me is my lovely wife.
    <br>She arrived yesterday.
    <br>Look, for you to know that you just have to continue to pray for this ministry.
    <br>After that prophetic word last Sunday, I said,
    <br>"You are not going home until I see your wife because the home is broken".
    <br>And I had to give a phone call to the wife
    <br>and arrange how the wife can come down from South Africa.
    <br>Because if I allow him to go, I have not done anything.
    <br>The woman must be here.
    <br>If not, all is in vain.
    <br>The reason that brought me to The SCOAN was problems in my business.
    <br>There was stagnation, career failure, limitation.
    <br>You know, many of us are here for certain things.
    <br>You don't know your problem.
    <br>What you are asking for is not even your problem.
    <br>He came because of business failure.
    <br>But the Lord is now telling him, "Your problem is pornography.
    <br>There is a broken home. That is your problem".
    <br>Once that is solved, the business will start to...
    <br>When you have a sickness, you'll hear, "I'm sick, I'm sick".
    <br>You never bother the cause of that sickness.
    <br>"I have failure in business, that is our problem".
    <br>But what is the cause of that failure?
    <br>"I have a headache, please pray for me."
    <br>But you don't mind the cause of that headache.
    <br>This is why this problem continued to repeat again.
    <br>If you have not touched the root, and you remove the sickness, you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Soon, the business failure will come back, because the root is there!
    <br>It's like a stream of water that is passing through somewhere
    <br>and you try to clean up that water - what of where the water is coming from?
    <br>This is the problem of all of us today.
    <br>We never mind the cause of our problem.
    <br>We fight against the problem, but we never mind the cause.
    <br>I was very shocked when the man of God said, 'You are addicted to pornography'.
    <br>He just went straight, exactly to the root cause of my problem.
    <br>This problem started some years back between 1995 and 1996.
    <br>My father told me that I had to go and wash his car.
    <br>Immediately I got inside his car, I found two pornographic magazines.
    <br>I collected those books and hid them inside my bedroom.
    <br>When my father left, I was busy looking at the pornographic pictures of naked women.
    <br>I became addicted to it; each and every day I looked at the pornographic magazines.
    <br>From then, 1999-2000, I began to be exposed to video cassettes.
    <br>I would wait for my parents to leave home, then I would be left alone, watching those video cassettes.
    <br>Then, in 2000, I impregnated a lady because of spirit of lust; the fornication was too much.
    <br>I started chasing women.
    <br>From there, the parents of the lady I impregnated sent her to my house.
    <br>I rejected her, I said I didn't know anything about it.
    <br>After 3 months, they changed the story; they said that I had raped the girl.
    <br>They went to the police station, and I was arrested for a week.
    <br>After they finished investigating the case, they released me.
    <br>By that time I was 16 to 17 years old.
    <br>After they finished investigating the case, they said that they had arrested somebody who was underage.
    <br>From there, from 2000 until 2005, I was afraid to meet with any girl.
    <br>But in 2005, I met my wife; I was doing my final year at the university.
    <br>This problem affected me so much because there was no affection between me and my wife.
    <br>I would keep on lusting after women.
    <br>This problem caused me to have two children outside of the marriage.
    <br>My wife is only aware of one.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Can you see? Are you listening to that?
    <br>My sister, you know you came here today to solve the problem once and for all.
    <br>No matter what happened, this is the husband God has ordained for you.
    <br>Ok?
    <br>If you are looking for a polished man to marry, are you yourself polished?
    <br>Ask your neighbor, "You are looking for a polished man to marry.
    <br>Are you also polished?"
    <br>You will polish the woman, and the woman will polish you.
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>"If you are looking for a polished man, a polished woman to marry, are you polished?"
    <br>We need to polish you.
    <br>You are like a shoe that is dirty.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because the urge was too much, Man of God, I got engaged to another lady.
    <br>I married my wife legally, but I had already given a ring to this other woman.
    <br>My wife is not aware that I am engaged to another woman outside.
    <br>So you have given a ring to a woman?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>I learnt that the sister is here.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is why I am telling you that the case is very complicated
    <br>but God will give us a way.
    <br>So, because God wants to restore the marriage...
    <br>The sister that has been given a ring is here already.
    <br>But God will solve the problem.
    <br>For the sister to come here, she also has a heart for God.
    <br>My sister, did you listen to that?
    <br>Don't be surprised to hear that.
    <br>Just to make sure everything is alright.
    <br>Ok?
    <br>Ok.
    <br>The same Spirit of God that propelled you to come here,
    <br>is the same Spirit of God that propelled that sister to be here.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Tshiuhombela Oscar
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Shall I give you a seat?
    <br>Go and bring a seat for my sister.
    <br>Not that she is sick, I just want her to sit down.
    <br>Ok?
    <br>I have given a ring to that lady but my wife is not aware.
    <br>I promised her that once I am back from The SCOAN or a trip to India for a massive project,
    <br>I would marry her.
    <br>Eh? When?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I used to beat my wife each and every day.
    <br>Whenever I looked at my wife, I wouldn't know what made me angry but I saw her as shit.
    <br>In fact, I was 95% outside of the marriage already.
    <br>It is alright. We don't want to hear; we are here for reconciliation.
    <br>We don't want to hear anything that will not glorify the reconciliation.
    <br>Ok, thank you.
    <br>My sister, please, to settle the marriage and everything, ok?
    <br>I will call the sister out, ok? I hope you don't mind.
    <br>Ok, thank you.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Tshiuhombela Oscar
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>The other lady is also not aware that the man is married.
    <br>But this is how you men, you guys do deceive people out there.
    <br>So, may God forgive all of you people.
    <br>I can't hear 'amen.'
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>For my sister to be here, you don't need to be told -
    <br>if she was the kind of person that doesn't want to hear God, you would not see her here
    <br>because of the nature of the matter.
    <br>For her to be here, I want to thank you very much.
    <br>Thank you for coming here.
    <br>And I want to assure you that your situation is my situation.
    <br>Your problem is my problem.
    <br>I will make sure you come here with a great testimony.
    <br>Thank you for honouring the prophet.
    <br>If you honour a prophet because he is a prophet, you will receive a prophet's reward.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am convinced that she is sorry for what happened.
    <br>I have not heard from her, I am just seeing her for the first time.
    <br>She is very very sorry, she never knew, she cannot be a party to a broken home.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>So that is it.
    <br>So please, your ring, she will give you your ring.
    <br>Now my sister is not interested.
    <br>So sorry, and sorry, it's over.
    <br>So please, that is it.
    <br>I think I will end the message like that.
    <br>I want to see my sister. Can you take my sister, let her go and sit down somewhere there.
    <br>I will see her after the service.
    <br>You came from South Africa?
    <br>Yes, I came from South Africa.
    <br>Thank you very much, I will take the responsibility. Ok?
    <br>So, go and wait for me. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you have the fear of God, you will do every proper thing to reconcile,
    <br>to say sorry.
    <br>She has the fear of God.
    <br>If God had to share a reward among the three, she would receive the greatest reward.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If God wanted to share a reward among the three people here -
    <br>that lady in red, that you see as the offender, she would receive the greater blessing
    <br>and greater reward for what she has done now.
    <br>So, that is God for you.
    <br>For somebody to actually come from South Africa over this issue
    <br>and she knew what she was coming here for.
    <br>But the fear is, that ring, she said, "I must see Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and hand over this ring to Prophet T.B. Joshua, and say I am sorry for what this man has caused".
    <br>Just like that.
    <br>So, are you listening to me? Thank you very much.
    <br>I am happy you are laughing now.
    <br>Old things passed away, every other thing has become new.
    <br>Ok? Can you just say sorry to your wife, whatever you have caused your wife.
    <br>No, no, no, don't go down on your knees. Stand up.
    <br>Don't go on your knees.
    <br>I am very sorry, my wife. I am very sorry.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Tshiuhombela Oscar
    <br>Reconciled After Prophecy
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So, I want to meet them.
    <br>And my sister there, too.
    <br>Ok, I understand what she demonstrated now.
    <br>The sister there.
    <br>So I quite understand her.
    <br>I will not allow her to talk, but I know what is on her mind.
    <br>Madam, can you see?
    <br>If God could go all this way, or go too far to reconcile your marriage -
    <br>so please, give your best to this marriage.
    <br>You are a mother to him.
    <br>Ok?
    <br>You have to tolerate him.
    <br>And he himself also has to tolerate you.
    <br>You are because she is, and she is because you are.
    <br>So, please, where he is weak, you are strong.
    <br>Where he is strong, you are weak.
    <br>Please tolerate each other. Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So I will meet them, let them go and have their seats.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I am very sorry to my wife.
    <br>In fact, as from now, it's like the first day when we met some years back.
    <br>I love my wife so much and I am very sorry for what I did to her.
    <br>After my deliverance, the day I saw my wife when she arrived here, I couldn't even help myself.
    <br>I ran to her, hugged and kissed her in front of everyone.
    <br>I love my wife so much.
    <br>I love you, my wife.
    <br>I love you.
    <br>I am very sorry, my wife. Please forgive me.
    <br>I forgive you. I love you.
    <br>After my deliverance, that same day, I felt something came out from my middle finger,
    <br>like somebody had pulled a ring off.
    <br>In my dreams, I am no longer seeing a spiritual wife or ladies queuing up to sleep with me.
    <br>I love my wife so much and I am no longer interested in seeing other women naked.
    <br>I am delivered and free from the spirit of pornography.
    <br>I thank God because the devil is out of my marriage, family, life and business.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I want to thank God because this problem had tormented me so much.
    <br>I was crying and praying every day for God to solve this problem
    <br>but I thank God because He located it; my problems are over and my pain has passed away.
    <br>I thank You, Lord.
    <br>I thank God because He used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver my husband.
    <br>Now he is a good husband and a lovely one.
    <br>I feel so great because my husband loves me so much after the deliverance.
    <br>When I came here on Saturday, I was surprised
    <br>because my husband came to me quickly and hugged me, and kissed me.
    <br>I was not expecting such a thing because he doesn't do this.
    <br>I thank You, Jesus because You delivered my husband.
    <br>I feel like it's the beginning of this marriage; and I thank God because we are starting a new relationship.
    <br>I love you so much.
    <br>I love you, too.
    <br>I have forgiven you, my husband.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Association brings assimilation.
    <br>I associated myself with pornography and began to behave like a sex worker.
    <br>My advice goes like this: If you make a mistake as we all do, don't run away from God; run to Him.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, with the Emmanuel TV partners all over the world,
    <br>has realized the need to also help you financially.
    <br>That is why the man of God said we should give you a sum of $1,000 to assist you back home
    <br>and also enable you and your wife to remain at peace.
    <br>We thank God. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for using the man of God to bless my marriage.
    <br>I never expected the man of God to bless me with such a huge amount; glory be to God.
    <br>This is a ministry which I know once you come here, you will never go back the same.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Apart from delivering me and restoring my marriage,
    <br>the man of God blessed me with the sum of $1,000.
    <br>I never expected this!
    <br>God bless the ministry and God bless the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My name is Mahada Shunsani. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I am a senior accounting clerk; that is a cashier supervisor.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God invited me and I came here to The SCOAN.
    <br>That was after I saw the deliverance of the guy I was dating, called Oscar.
    <br>He was being delivered that Sunday which was the man of God's birthday.
    <br>When I was watching Emmanuel TV at home, I saw him being delivered.
    <br>Then the man of God said he was addicted to pornography and it had destroyed his marriage.
    <br>As I was one of the girls he was dating, I felt in my heart that I maybe was one of the major causes
    <br>or people who had broken their marriage.
    <br>We were dating. He proposed to me and gave me an engagement ring.
    <br>As the man of God was prophesying, I realised that what I was doing was wrong.
    <br>Within the week, I got an invitation from the man of God to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I found it in my heart to say this was my chance as I knew I also needed to be delivered
    <br>and what I was doing was wrong. I could not stand to see me destroying someone's marriage
    <br>because if it happened to me, I would not like it.
    <br>When the man of God called me to come here, I found it worrying.
    <br>Even though it took me time to be with him, I knew it would cause my life to be unhappy.
    <br>I had to come here for my own deliverance, so I would get my own husband, family and home.
    <br>When I was watching Emmanuel TV that very Sunday when Brother Oscar was delivered,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke about love and offence, just like the message he preached last week.
    <br>Then, I felt it in my heart that I had offended his wife and abused her emotionally.
    <br>When the man of God was talking about love and offence, I said to myself that there was no way
    <br>I could say I was praying and expect God to hear when I was still offending her.
    <br>I then felt I should tell her that I love her from my heart and put myself in her shoes.
    <br>If I were in her shoes and this happened to me, what would I do? Would I be happy with that?
    <br>After the man of God spoke about offence and love, I decided to take this chance.
    <br>On that Sunday, I sent her a text message and asked her to forgive me.
    <br>I asked her to find a place in her heart to forgive me because I knew I had offended her.
    <br>When the man of God invited me, I couldn't wait. I wanted to fly the same moment I got the call.
    <br>I was so happy, knowing I was going to get my own portion of deliverance
    <br>and have a chance to say sorry to her in a way she would understand.
    <br>When the man of God called me out, I felt honoured
    <br>and introduced myself as the woman Oscar had engaged.
    <br>As the man of God talked to me and held my hand, I couldn't think of anything else.
    <br>I felt peace from there and knew that this is what I wanted - to be out of this relationship.
    <br>I had been struggling for long but this was my opportunity and time to be delivered.
    <br>I felt peace when he talked to us and told his wife that this was her husband from God.
    <br>When he told me God would provide my own man, I felt so peaceful, released and free.
    <br>When he called me to his office and I met him, he prayed for me
    <br>I just felt free; I felt that urge and desire leaving me.
    <br>When he prayed for me, I collapsed, vomitted and then afterwards I felt free.
    <br>It felt like something came out of me; I felt so relieved and free.
    <br>I realised after he prayed for me that what I was doing was wrong.
    <br>I could not be in love with someone who is married and break someone's house.
    <br>I felt free after that and I know I am delivered for good.
    <br>Currently, I just want to say I am sorry to his wife.
    <br>I know I abused her emotionally because she knew of our relationship
    <br>but didn't know what to do about it because we kept going back to each other.
    <br>So, I want to say sorry to his wife and give back the ring to Oscar to say I don't need it anymore.
    <br>I know I will have my own portion, so I want to give the ring back and say sorry to his wife.
    <br>What I can say to the ladies out there is that God's delay is not God's denial.
    <br>Learn to be patient.
    <br>I have realised I should have been patient and wait for my own husband.
    <br>So, be strong and wait for the Lord's time because God's time is the best.
    <br>God's delay is not God's denial.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, in his usual kind gesture
    <br>knows fully well that we wouldn't want you to go just like that.
    <br>He also said he would like to bless you with the sum of $1.000 to assist you back home.
    <br>This is from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world.
    <br>I thank you very much for this gift I just received from the man of God.
    <br>I am very grateful and thankful. Thank you very much. You have honoured me a lot.
    <br>May God richly bless you. I thank God and I thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God has done this for me; I really don't know how to express myself.
    <br>I was not expecting this gift or anything except for me to confess and be prayed for.
    <br>Now, I have received deliverance, peace of heart, this gift of $1.000 and The Mirror book.
    <br>It's a lot to me and I am very thankful and grateful.
    <br>I just want to say I am sorry to them and give them their ring.
    <br>Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>Now, I want to say this to Oscar. I am bringing this ring in peace.
    <br>Now the man of God has delivered you and told you that your marriage is from God,
    <br>I believe it and I am bringing this ring in peace.
    <br>I would like to advise you to have your house in order and enjoy your marriage.
    <br>May you and your wife please find it in your hearts to forgive me
    <br>as I am bringing this ring back to you.
    <br>I forgive you and I am very sorry. I also ask you to forgive me.
    <br>It was not myself but the spirit of pornography which was pushing me.
    <br>I was being tormented by the spirit of lust and fornication.
    <br>I am very sorry for wasting your time.
    <br>After my deliverance, I realised that what I was doing was totally wrong.
    <br>I want to let you know that God loves you more than the way I love you
    <br>and I wish you the best.
    <br>May God bless you as you have your future partner, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>I just want to say to you that I am very sorry.
    <br>I know I abused you emotionally.
    <br>I know that what you were going through was not good.
    <br>I have realised that what I was doing was wrong.
    <br>Now that I am delivered, may you please forgive me.
    <br>May you please find it in your heart.
    <br>Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>I'm sorry.
    <br>Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>Please forgive me. I'm very sorry.
    <br>Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>I have forgiven you. I love you so much, my sister.
    <br>I have forgiven you with all of my heart
    <br>and I love you so much, my sister.
    <br>I wish you the best.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
