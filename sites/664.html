    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I'll just say yes You lead the way
    <br>I'm not afraid of what it means for me to say
    <br>This life You gave is not my own
    <br>I'm trusting You to hear my yes to lead me on
    <br>Yes Lord yes Lord my life is Yours
    <br>I'll just say yes You lead the way
    <br>I'm not afraid of what it means for me to say
    <br>This life You gave is not my own
    <br>I'm trusting You to hear my yes to lead me on
    <br>Yes Lord yes Lord my life is Yours
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You have decreed the answer to yourself; give thanks to God for your confession.
    <br>That is strong confession.
    <br>Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised to do – that is favour.
    <br>He promised to favour you and you have decreed it already.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We want to fight – wage war aggressively against those things you want to do and you do not do.
    <br>You want to be faithful but you find yourself unfaithful.
    <br>Demons are the cause.
    <br>Many things you want to do but you do not do.
    <br>For you, you want to be faithful, kind, obedient but you find yourself otherwise – losing control.
    <br>Demons are the cause; demons are behind it.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>This is why we are here, to fight those demons aggressively, in the name of Jesus
    <br>and to restore you back because it takes control of your emotions.
    <br>You react emotionally.
    <br>Ordinarily, as a Christian, you would not react like that.
    <br>If I'm right...
    <br>It seems to take control of your emotions.
    <br>It has to lose that grip, in the name of Jesus; and leave you alone, because you are a child of God.
    <br>You are a child of God; that is why you are here today.
    <br>You know, ordinarily you can't come here.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Ordinarily, you can't come here, going by what you have gone through before coming here.
    <br>What you have seen before coming here, what you have heard before coming here,
    <br>the pain and all you have gone through – ordinarily, you cannot come here.
    <br>This is to prove that you are a child of God.
    <br>Ordinarily, you would have been here a long time ago.
    <br>There are many people here today who were supposed to be here ten years ago;
    <br>ordinarily, they would have been here ten years ago.
    <br>But you can't come here ordinarily.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Ordinarily, you cannot come here".
    <br>[Ordinarily, you cannot come here.]
    <br>And ordinarily, you would not be able to obey what you hear today or what you are seeing;
    <br>ordinarily, you cannot obey them.
    <br>You can say you are not ordinary.
    <br>You are not ordinary; so, why do you compare yourself to others?
    <br>When others go this way, you want to go that way.
    <br>YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHERS
    <br>When you are sick...
    <br>You always compare your sickness to others.
    <br>Your sickness is not like others.
    <br>Your sickness is not to kill you or destroy you but to strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am not ordinary".
    <br>[I am not ordinary.]
    <br>If you know that your disappointment is not like others -
    <br>others, their disappointment is to destroy them, to ruin them.
    <br>But your disappointment is to strengthen your desire, to prepare you for a new life coming.
    <br>You need some...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am not ordinary".
    <br>[I am not ordinary.]
    <br>If you know you are not ordinary, why do you compare yourself to others?
    <br>When others have headache, their headache can kill them – your headache cannot kill you.
    <br>It is the same name; headache, cancer, liver problem - but yours are not like others.
    <br>Your pain is not like others.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Stop comparing yourself to others.
    <br>When others laugh you laugh - no.
    <br>You are under His eyes; you must hear from above.
    <br>You need corresponding power to do whatever you want to do.
    <br>They don't need any to do whatever they want to do.
    <br>You are not ordinary - tell you neighbour.
    <br>[You are not ordinary.]
    <br>Stop comparing yourself to others.
    <br>When others want to go this way you want to go that way.
    <br>This is why you are facing difficulties.
    <br>Your pain, from today, is not like others.
    <br>The Bible says that you will have pain, but that pain is not like the pain of others.
    <br>Your pain could be headache, setback, disappointment, even your pain could be divorce.
    <br>That divorce is not like others – it is to preserve you from something bad that is coming.
    <br>When you have some little problem you will look at others that had such a problem in the past.
    <br>You will see what happened to them; they die, they cripple;
    <br>you would think the same thing would happen to you - no.
    <br>Your problem is no like others.
    <br>God is aware of your pain.
    <br>He said, 'In this world, there will be trouble, tribulation; cheer up, I'm aware'.
    <br>Whatever you are going through now is for a purpose.
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[What are you going through?]
    <br>It is not possible for anyone to say, "I am not going through anything".
    <br>You must be going through something because you are a stranger in here.
    <br>You are a stranger.
    <br>If you are in a place where you are a stranger you cannot avoid being punched.
    <br>It is not possible when you find yourself as a stranger in a new city, new place...
    <br>You are a stranger, no matter how many years you spend on this earth.
    <br>You are a stranger and you are in the market.
    <br>No matter how many years you spend in the market, you will still return home.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter how many years you spend in the market, you will return home".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will definitely return home.
    <br>What we are going through is not like others.
    <br>You must be going through something because there is no 'free zone'.
    <br>You must be going through something.
    <br>That does not mean you are not a Christian or a friend of Jesus.
    <br>That does not mean you are not a candidate of Heaven – you are a candidate.
    <br>You must be going through something.
    <br>That something is the purpose of your praying the more, fasting the more.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are you going through?"
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[What are you going through?]
    <br>I cannot hear you
    <br>[What are you going through?]
    <br>It is meant to strengthen you; tell you neighbour.
    <br>[It is meant to strengthen you]
    <br>It is meant to prepare you for eternal life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is meant to prepare you for eternal life.
    <br>That does not mean because you are going through something you will not say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You refuse to say "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You always ask for healing, deliverance... No.
    <br>If you are waiting for when you will be one hundred percent free,
    <br>you will not say, "Thank You, Jesus" one day.
    <br>That time will never come.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[That time will never come.]
    <br>Waiting for a hundred percent free – that time will never come.
    <br>Waiting for a hundred percent free – that time may never come.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Waiting for a hundred percent free – that time may never come.]
    <br>That is what you are waiting for.
    <br>Yesterday you had a headache.
    <br>Now the headache is gone.
    <br>Now stomachache.
    <br>Because of stomachache you will not give thanks to God for taking away the headache.
    <br>What you are waiting for is to be one hundred percent pain free and success in business.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>You can move freely.
    <br>You receive a phone call, "Hello, the business is fine".
    <br>You sleep well - no nightmares.
    <br>You open the doors - no problem.
    <br>Everybody praises you.
    <br>No one talks bad about you.
    <br>No one persecutes or intimidates you.
    <br>This is what you are waiting for.
    <br>That time may never come.
    <br>If the money in business comes, there will come a problem to consume this money.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>When there is no money, your child has no sickness.
    <br>When there is money your child has a sickness.
    <br>When you do not have money nobody would call you a bad name.
    <br>When you have money they would say you did a ritual.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That time may never come because you are a stranger in the market.
    <br>A man may be sick in body and yet, a friend of God.
    <br>If you see somebody sick you say this is a result of a sin.
    <br>It is an enemy.
    <br>When you see somebody sick you say it is a result of a sin... No.
    <br>A man may be sick and yet, a favourite of Jesus.
    <br>Don’t let your situation rule you.
    <br>The situation used to talk, it has a voice.
    <br>You will hear; "Why this problem? Because you are not faithful. Because Jesus doesn't love you.
    <br>That is why you have this problem. Look at your colleague who is a smoker - a "club-goer;
    <br>his life is fine. You don't have money. He is the one giving you money."
    <br>This kind of voice is to overthrow your position.
    <br>Ordinarily, you cannot come here.
    <br>You wake up in the morning, you dress up; something would talk to you, "Don't go" - it is a battle.
    <br>"Don't go. What are you going to do there? The man will not come out. He will not see you."
    <br>You will receive a phone call, saying that million dollars has been reserved for you, you just have to come.
    <br>Oh, I will not go to the church...
    <br>But at the end - you are here.
    <br>YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHERS
    <br>That is what I mean by "ordinarily, you cannot come here."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth – ordinarily, you cannot come here.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth – ordinarily, you cannot come here. "
    <br>How do you know where you are going is a place where God wants you to be?
    <br>The moment you have the thought of going there, battle starts.
    <br>Trouble.
    <br>Maybe it is a place, where God wants you to be - and you receive a news that you must go there.
    <br>It may take two weeks to go.
    <br>The trouble will come.
    <br>Thoughts of not going there will come.
    <br>You may even be arrested in order to stop you from going there.
    <br>A lot of news, phone calls, troubles...
    <br>You may not even have money to come.
    <br>You may have an accident on the day of coming; nothing would happen to you, but the vehicle will be damaged.
    <br>Just to stop you from going there.
    <br>There are many businesses you have lost to prevent you from coming here.
    <br>Whatever you want to do and it’s smooth at the beginning, know the end is not good.
    <br>When you start something and the beginning is smooth, profitable; know that the end is to cry about.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives an attack.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have lost many relationships because hearing that this man is a criminal; whereas satan doesn't want you
    <br>to continue this relationship.
    <br>It is a relationship that would be profitable and would change and transform your life.
    <br>But someone says that this man is a criminal.
    <br>They will even send a letter, a text message...
    <br>They will do a lot to stop you.
    <br>Many of you stopped a lot of relationships just because of what you had heard.
    <br>And that is the relationship that could have changed your life and career.
    <br>Are you talking of business?
    <br>When you start a business that would transform your life, take you to "high places", it would look like a trouble.
    <br>You will see lost in whatever you invest in.
    <br>As you move the troubles continue.
    <br>As you move the troubles continue to the extent you find yourself in debts.
    <br>Please continue; these troubles will stop somewhere.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Those troubles will stop somewhere and the beginning of your joy is there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many of you has today many business cards.
    <br>You don' know which one to use.
    <br>You were once a lawyer, now you are a contractor of any kind.
    <br>It is because of failures, debts you keep running from one business to another.
    <br>And you don't know that those things are a proof of genuineness of what you are doing.
    <br>Are you talking of marriage?
    <br>There are many marriages today...
    <br>My God.
    <br>People move from one man to another, one woman to another; just because of crisis -
    <br>and that crisis is a test to proof that this is a marriage from God.
    <br>There can be no genuine without first, fake.
    <br>When you meet a good family today; they will tell you what they have gone through,
    <br>before becoming a "role model".
    <br>A good marriage; when you meet them they will tell you what they have gone through.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the same business...
    <br>Many businessman today that are at the centre of their own world - it was a sack letter that put them there.
    <br>The sack letter they received initially gave them that idea to start their own business.
    <br>Today, they are world generals.
    <br>But many of us, while receiving a sack letter, think of committing suicide, or joining a criminal gang.
    <br>Many are arm-robbers, murderers today.
    <br>When you catch them they will tell you, "I was once a manager of a company. I was sucked.
    <br>I had nothing to do. I joined the arm-robbers".
    <br>Whereas many successful businessmen started their own business when the sack letter was given them.
    <br>Life is just like that.
    <br>You need to sit down and ask yourself, "Am I right?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In our walking with the Lord, there are good and hard times.
    <br>In our walking with the Lord; time to laugh and time to cry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know those things that can cause crying.
    <br>It could be persecution, sickness, pains of all kinds.
    <br>Failure, hatred, temptation.
    <br>In our walking with the Lord, there are good and hard times alike.
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>This is to walk together with Jesus.
    <br>There are good times and there are hard times, when we are walking.
    <br>You know good times, but hard times you may not know.
    <br>Good time is a time to laugh, "I am happy, everything is OK".
    <br>And there is a hard time, and you know those things that can cause crying.
    <br>You know those things.
    <br>What you are going through.
    <br>These are the things that can cause crying;
    <br>pain,
    <br>sickness - you may receive a medical report saying that, "this is death".
    <br>You would cry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But you never consider the other side
    <br>in your walking with Him.
    <br>This is why Himself said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>Because He knew that there would be hard times, time to cry.
    <br>You would rather seek a witch doctor than Jesus.
    <br>He said, "I pray your faith will not fail", when the hard time comes, while walking with me.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>It means that something will challenge you, tempt you, hit you, bite you, curse you, something will... Oh my God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In a hard time, when you are overwhelmed, you lose relationship with Jesus.
    <br>At the same time you cannot...
    <br>The joyful heart is where Jesus...
    <br>When you are overwhelmed...
    <br>The thing that can make you cry, and overwhelms you - you cannot serve God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is what happens to you people today.
    <br>You seem to be overwhelmed.
    <br>Things that can make you cry; not only you cry but you are overwhelmed by the thing.
    <br>Not only you cry, complain, murmur, you are despaired but you are overwhelmed.
    <br>When you are overwhelmed by the situation you cannot pray.
    <br>You will lose the relationship.
    <br>The relationship is gone.
    <br>Then you ask, "Why me of this?"
    <br>You begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>Ordinarily, you cannot be here.
    <br>If you are overwhelmed by your situation you cannot come here.
    <br>You are here because your are not overwhelmed yet.
    <br>You have a situation but you are not overwhelmed yet.
    <br>You cannot come here ordinarily -
    <br>as it should be by divine will.
    <br>God is aware of your coming here.
    <br>[Amen.]
