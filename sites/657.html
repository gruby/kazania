    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On the 25th December 2011,
    <br>during a Live Sunday Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>And euro -
    <br>we pray for this European community
    <br>because I see the euro,
    <br>which holds them together,
    <br>will be affected.
    <br>And many countries will want to go back.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
