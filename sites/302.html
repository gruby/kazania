    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with you,
    <br>with your nation...
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Take a look at the Book of John 14; I'm taking my reading from verse 1.
    <br>"Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me."
    <br>God - mediator.
    <br>Verse 2:
    <br>"In My Father's house are many mansions;
    <br>if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
    <br>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself;
    <br>that where I am, there you may be also.
    <br>And where I go you know, and the way you know."
    <br>There are two things now, "Where I go you know" and the way to that place also you know.
    <br>Next text will give us the proof text where we are going.
    <br>"Thomas said to Him, 'Lord, we do not know where You are going,
    <br>and how can we know the way?' "
    <br>The same questions, "Where I go you know" and "the way you know".
    <br>Thomas is now asking where and the way.
    <br>Now, verse 6.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.
    <br>No one comes to the Father except through Me.' "
    <br>We take the title:
    <br>OUR MEDIATOR
    <br>In that verse 6:
    <br>"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.' "
    <br>Let us consider these jointly.
    <br>That is, the way, the truth and the life.
    <br>We shall consider them jointly with reference to each other.
    <br>Christ is the way, the truth and the life.
    <br>That is, He is the beginning, the middle and the end.
    <br>He said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life".
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>We should not just pick the Bible and begin to read.
    <br>When you read, you must allow the Spirit of God to explain.
    <br>When you read the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He is the beginning, the middle and the end.
    <br>As the truth, He is the source.
    <br>As the life, He is the end of it.
    <br>It has no beginning; it has no end.
    <br>You have a beginning; you have an end.
    <br>He has no beginning, He has no end.
    <br>Here, as a Mediator...
    <br>You agree with me that Jesus is the sinner's only Saviour - the way, the reality.
    <br>There is no reality outside Him.
    <br>That life is eternal life; that is, the nature of God.
    <br>Here is His master statement: "No one can approach God but through Me."
    <br>The sinner cannot reach God except through Him.
    <br>The unsaved might cry to God for a thousand years
    <br>but if there is no Mediator, there will be no hope for them.
    <br>No man can approach God without the Mediator.
    <br>Let someone say, "Our mediator".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Can you see the reason why you talk to the air and you think you are praying.
    <br>When you pray, you must bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Jesus and the Word are one.
    <br>I know, by looking into the Word and acting on it, I will bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus" - without looking into the Word and acting on it, you are talking to yourself.
    <br>You will only hear yourself;
    <br>people around you will hear you but God will not hear you.
    <br>By looking into the Word and acting on it, you will bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Let someone say, "Our Mediator".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Our Mediator.
    <br>Until you look into the Word and act on it, nothing will happen.
    <br>Let someone say, "Nothing, until you look into the Word and act on it".
    <br>The Bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.
    <br>It says you shall lay hands on the sick and the sick shall recover;
    <br>but nothing, until you look into the Word.
    <br>You are depending on the Word and I am depending on the Word.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of 1 Timothy 2:5.
    <br>"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus."
    <br>I want us to read together.
    <br>"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus."
    <br>This means,
    <br>Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>A man was asking me if a Christian sins or what a sin is to a Christian.
    <br>When a Christian sins, fellowship is broken but he does not lose his place as a son.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"When a Christian sins, fellowship is broken but he does not lose his place as a son."
    <br>We have Someone at the right hand of God interceding, who ever remains faithful.
    <br>"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus."
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Man not only needs a Mediator but after he becomes a Christian,
    <br>he is living in a world dominated by satan.
    <br>As a Christian, looking at your immediate surroundings,
    <br>what you see is frightening:
    <br>Economic oppression - poverty.
    <br>Physical oppression - disease and disability.
    <br>Demonic oppression - occultic practice and ritual murder.
    <br>Are you talking of religious oppression? - Intolerance and violence everywhere.
    <br>Are you talking of moral oppression? - Institutionalised corruption in high places.
    <br>Man not only needs a Mediator but after he becomes a Christian,
    <br>he is living in a world dominated by satan.
    <br>As a Christian, when you move around, what you see around you; east, west, south,
    <br>your right, your left, everywhere - it is frightening.
    <br>His ministry of intercession is little appreciated by believers.
    <br>In every temptation, in every trial, in every hard place,
    <br>Jesus ever lives to pray for us.
    <br>IMPORTANT TEACHING ON SIN - TB Joshua
    <br>That is the reason of our victory.
    <br>Christians can make bad mistakes;
    <br>the difference is that they already have a relationship.
    <br>The difference between Christians' mistakes and others who are not -
    <br>Christians already have a relationship.
    <br>When you have a relationship with Jesus,
    <br>you change and become a man who is directed by the Holy Ghost,
    <br>not by the influence from others, not by what we are seeing around,
    <br>or what you read on the pages of the newspapers, or what people say,
    <br>what you see, what your situation looks like, what you hear - no!
    <br>It is your situation that dictates the direction of your prayer.
    <br>Your condition dictates what to say to Jesus.
    <br>But you can be sick and say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>This is why satan will continue to tempt you, because he knows that
    <br>when you say, "Thank You, Jesus", you build the relationship.
    <br>If you are sick, that does not mean you cannot say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>A man can be sick in body yet a favourite of Heaven.
    <br>I've come to say how much I love You
    <br>I've come to say how much I adore You
    <br>I'm not here to complain
    <br>About my many problems
    <br>By Your Spirit and Your grace
    <br>I'm confident You'll solve them
    <br>I'm here to say I love You
    <br>I'm here to say I adore You
    <br>I'm here to say I love You
    <br>I love to love You Lord
    <br>I'm here to say I love You
    <br>I'm here to say I adore You
    <br>I'm here to say I love You
    <br>I love to love You Lord
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Wonderful.
    <br>A Christian can make a bad mistake;
    <br>the difference is that they already have a relationship.
    <br>They go to God immediately about their behaviour
    <br>and the Lord helps and gets them back on their feet,
    <br>forgives them and helps them not to make the same mistake.
    <br>When you make a mistake, don't run from God; run to Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you make a mistake, don't run from God; run to Him."
    <br>Run to Him about your behaviour.
    <br>He is a merciful God, who ever remains faithful.
    <br>When you sin, as a Christian, fellowship is broken
    <br>but your place is there as a son.
    <br>We have Someone at the right hand of the Father, who ever remains faithful.
    <br>A Christian can make a bad mistake;
    <br>the difference between you and others - you already have a relationship.
    <br>When you have a relationship with Jesus,
    <br>you change and become a man who is directed by the Heavenly Father -
    <br>a privilege to let Him instruct you.
    <br>God wants to be involved in everything concerning you
    <br>and walk you through whatever life brings.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God wants to be involved in your life and walk you through whatever life brings."
    <br>That is God for you - He loves you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>When a Christian sins, he does not lose his place as a son but loses fellowship.
    <br>We have Someone at the right hand of God, at the right hand of the Father
    <br>who ever remains faithful.
    <br>God bless His Word.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Jesus Jesus Jesus 
    <br>What a wonder You are
    <br>Oh Jesus what a wonder You are
    <br>Jesus Jesus Jesus 
    <br>What a wonder You are
    <br>Oh Jesus what a wonder You are
    <br>Lion of the tribe of Judah
    <br>What a wonder You are
    <br>Oh Jesus what a wonder You are
    <br>Beautiful rose of Sharon
    <br>What a wonder You are
    <br>Oh Jesus what a wonder You are
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you and I know you are blessed.
    <br>The love of God has blessed you.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Later, the man of God went further to explain the message he was talking about
    <br>concerning when a Christian sins, that though fellowship is broken, he does not lose his place as a son.
    <br>When you sin, you do not lose your place as a son but your fellowship.
    <br>The Lord knows you can still return.
    <br>He loves us so much; He knows you can still return, come back.
    <br>If you have lost your place as a son, you will not be able to come back again
    <br>because there is no place for you.
    <br>That is why that place is there.
    <br>If you stand up from the seat...
    <br>It is permanent - nobody will sit down there.
    <br>Nobody will go there - if you don't come back here again, nobody will sit on that seat.
    <br>That is what I mean by, "If you sin, you do not lose your place as a son but your fellowship".
    <br>Now, let's go.
    <br>Can you see our brother?
    <br>He is going out but we are worshipping.
    <br>He is not here - that is what he loses.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Now, he is not here, he has gone.
    <br>We are worshipping; but nobody will sit here - it will be empty.
    <br>We continue to worship...
    <br>He has lost what?
    <br>The fellowship, but the place is still there.
    <br>IMPORTANT TEACHING ON SIN - TB Joshua
    <br>The teaching and the doctrine many of us receive today as if you have lost your place.
    <br>There is no seat for you as a son.
    <br>There is nothing like that.
    <br>Assume you knew this long time ago,
    <br>it would not take you long to come back.
    <br>You would have come back to God, instead of running from God when you are wrong.
    <br>Anytime you make a mistake, instead of running from God,
    <br>you would run to God because your seat is still there.
    <br>Thank you very much.
