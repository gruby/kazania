    <br>CHANGING LIVES
    <br>Emanuel! God is with us! Viewers around the world, welcome to today's episode of changing lives.
    <br>My name is Chris.
    <br>My name is Olamide.
    <br>This is the programme where we personally encounter those who have personally encountered
    <br>Jesus Christ in a special way through the ministry that God has given to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Yes, Chris. Today, we live in a world where many view life as fun and games.
    <br>They pursue pleasure at the price of peace
    <br>but always end up being left with a sense of dissatisfaction in life.
    <br>That's very true, Olamide.
    <br>By the grace of God, the life experience of the couple that we have with us here today
    <br>on changing lives is a very poignant reminder that life is indeed not fun and games.
    <br>In fact, viewers, it is a warfare where only the serious-minded are victorious.
    <br>Yes, indeed. Little did our guests know that life did not just happen to him.
    <br>It's all about choices and how he responded to every situation.
    <br>Before his success came, he made many wrong choices in the past that almost crippled his marriage,
    <br>his professional life but when he connected to the anointing that breaks the yoke
    <br>here at The SCOAN, that was when he rediscovered his roots
    <br>and began to walk into his divine destiny - both personally and professionally.
    <br>Today we have the pleasure of speaking with one of Nigeria's most celebrated film critic and scholar.
    <br>He is a publisher, an author and also a PhD holder from the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.
    <br>He is also the sitting dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Port Harcourt, River State, Nigeria.
    <br>He is also a member of the university's governing council.
    <br>You're welcome to this programme, Prof. Femi Shaka and his wife.
    <br>Thank you for joining us on this programme.
    <br>- It's been a pleasure.
    <br>- You're welcome.
    <br>Tell us more about yourself and tell us the reason why you're here on the programme today.
    <br>I am Professor Femi Okiremuete Shaka.
    <br>I studied at the universities of Benin, Ibadan in Nigeria, and then proceeded to the United Kingdom
    <br>on commonwealth scholarship to take a PhD in film studies at the University of Warwick, Coventry.
    <br>Thereafter, I returned to Nigeria in 1995 to take up an appointment at the University of Port Harcourt.
    <br>But the story is a little bit full of disappointment, near success situations and so on and so forth.
    <br>Returning from the UK with a PhD in film studies, which was very rare at the time I got it,
    <br>I expected that the university would grab me and be very happy to have somebody
    <br>in a new discipline in the country.
    <br>But my employment was delayed for one full year, and I couldn't understand it.
    <br>It was as if all the expectations I had in coming back...
    <br>I had the opportunity of going to Canada, Australia or the US
    <br>but I decided to come home to pass on the knowledge.
    <br>So you can imagine the feeling of disappointment I had when my employment was delayed.
    <br>Since then, I've been having a lot of delays in life expectations.
    <br>About 1995 or thereabout, I met my wife.
    <br>She was doing a programme then at the university.
    <br>I had just returned. We met, dated for a couple of years and then got married.
    <br>In 2001, the year of 9/11, I got a Fulbright scholarship to go back to the US.
    <br>I taught and carried out research at the New York University -
    <br>African and African-American studies programme.
    <br>I was there for one year, and it was during that tenure there that I wrote my book on African cinema.
    <br>When I returned, I got really distracted.
    <br>First I got elected into the senior staff club of the university.
    <br>University in Nigeria are almost a small community of their own.
    <br>Most of them have staff quarters, health centres, primary school for the children of staff,
    <br>nursery and high school.
    <br>The high school is like a teaching laboratory for students specialising in education.
    <br>So I got elected into the staff club and that is where my life started going down the drain
    <br>because I then started indulging and drinking.
    <br>Most of the time I used to boast to my friends that my movement was triangular.
    <br>If you didn't find me in the house, I had gone for lectures.
    <br>Then there were two places you could get me - if I was not in the lecture room,
    <br>I would be in the staff club, and if I was not in the staff club, I would be in the house.
    <br>I spent most of the time in the staff club drinking with my friends,
    <br>arguing over nothing.
    <br>And you can imagine that when you've taken a long drink and you're high,
    <br>when you see all your friends phoning their girlfriends, telling them to come over
    <br>to join them at the staff club, you are tempted to join them and I did join them.
    <br>Very soon, I became an expert.
    <br>Whenever you are traveling for external examination, you would talk about, "Oh boy. Are you carrying a handbag?"
    <br>I mean, such kind of misogynistic expressions.
    <br>The grace of God was upon my work because I noticed that each time I went out on these exploits,
    <br>she would usually catch me.
    <br>When you say that you were carrying a handbag, you need to explain it a bit.
    <br>It is a girlfirend.
    <br>It refers to a girlfriend - handbag.
    <br>When you are travelling, you are supposed to carry a handbag.
    <br>Men don't carry handbags which tells you the derogatory language we used for our women.
    <br>From my own personal experience, it was something that was destroying me and my career.
    <br>Rather than really publishing and getting celebrated, I was going down
    <br>because I was spending more time in the staff club than at my desk as a researcher,.
    <br>I should have been spending more time burning the midnight oil and reading and publishing papers.
    <br>That was when my promotion got delayed again for about eight years, even though I was well published.
    <br>I'm sorry to cut in - could you just tell us of the scale and scope of the kind of alcohol you were taking,
    <br>as a result of this lifestyle.
    <br>It was much.
    <br>We used to boast.
    <br>I would say, "Get me an electric pole". An electric pole is like a big bottle of stout, and then you mix it with coke.
    <br>You can take about four of that.
    <br>You would have just finished from the lecture hall and come to the club. You had not eaten.
    <br>So most of the time, you were high and lost track of things.
    <br>You would not be thinking straight as you should as a scholar,
    <br>and you weren't really paying more attention to your studies and teaching.
    <br>Your teaching is based on the experiences you have picked up.
    <br>You are supposed to do a lot of research before you go to the classroom to teach.
    <br>I was a stickler for time and everything but even at my own level of education
    <br>I could feel that I wasn't doing what I ought to do.
    <br>I mean, by the kind of instruction I was put through in the UK, I knew I wasn't giving my best,
    <br>even though among my colleagues, I was celebrated as one of the best lecturers in my department.
    <br>I even won some awards - three or four years as the best teacher in the department.
    <br>But I knew within me that I could do better than what I was doing.
    <br>So my kids were not really seeing me. I was an absentee father.
    <br>Whenever they called me and said, "Daddy, there's homework",
    <br>I would say, "Please give it to your mom or to the lesson teacher!"
    <br>I would just storm out and the house was very hot for me.
    <br>I just couldn't understand why I couldn't feel comfortable in my house - the house was just hot.
    <br>I just had to get out. When I was driving to the staff club, that is when I would feel free, happy and relaxed.
    <br>But it wasn't the best of life.
    <br>My promotion, like I said, was delayed by eight years.
    <br>It gave me some time to think over my life,
    <br>"What is happening to me? Where am I? I mean, I have a Christian upbringing.
    <br>So what is happening to me?"
    <br>Sorry to cut you short.
    <br>During this time were your students and fellow lecturers aware of your activities outside the university?
    <br>No way! They weren't aware.
    <br>I was living a secret life - a very secret life.
    <br>Most of the time I thought I was deceiving my wife but the grace of God was upon her.
    <br>Like I said, she would always catch me in the act.
    <br>One time I asked her, "Is anybody telling you what I'm doing
    <br>or how come you are always catching me when I go out?"
    <br>She would say, "Look. Unless you come out of your escapades, sinful life -
    <br>the Lord will clean you up first before you will start to see your life, visions
    <br>the way they are supposed to come".
    <br>I would laugh over it.
    <br>My sister-in-law came to the house.
    <br>I was always very moody because my promotion had been delayed.
    <br>Many people whom I felt were not well published as I was were getting promoted.
    <br>I was complaining and she asked whether we had heard about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Sorry to cut you again, sir. Before you talk about discovering Emmanuel TV,
    <br>we still want our viewers to really learn from what you're talking about - your experience with this lifestyle.
    <br>Did you at any time consider the risks or the repercussions of such a lifestyle?
    <br>Of course no!
    <br>Anybody who is into smoking or is into a particular lifestyle
    <br>does not really see that there are repercussions.
    <br>I mean I could have contracted a disease and passed it on to my wife.
    <br>Both of us could have died. What about the kids that we brought into the world?
    <br>I didn't really give any thought to that.
    <br>As far as I was concerned, I was seeking pleasure and I was getting plenty of it.
    <br>A university like ours - because I was also dedicated to my duty in a way, compared to other lecturers.
    <br>Girls were around; they were always coming around.
    <br>There was a lot of temptation in getting really sunk into that kind of whirlpool of sinfulness
    <br>Something that I can say - only the good Lord pulled me out of it
    <br>because I mean, how do you live a life where you are a stranger before your kids?
    <br>Each time you come, it is as if everybody starts hiding
    <br>and talks like, "Daddy has come back!" They would start shouting that.
    <br>I would start shouting, asking for my food.
    <br>If my food did not come quickl, I would go up straight to my bed.
    <br>I knew I was hurting my wife but I was helpless
    <br>because there was a spirit driving me that I couldn't control and contain.
    <br>So maybe we can see you actually in a world of your own.
    <br>Yes, and many of my colleagues are living the same kind of life.
    <br>Many of them are still into it, even as I'm speaking now.
    <br>Many of them are in the club drinking, shouting and arguing over nonsense.
    <br>Their families are lonely.
    <br>Their wife and children really deserve to have their father in the home.
    <br>I was absent.
    <br>Thank You, Father.
    <br>So then what you thought you were doing to create pleasure for yourself,
    <br>can we say that it actually satisfied you or you felt fulfilled during that time?
    <br>No, I was empty and looking for more of it!
    <br>There was a time before I travelled to the US, we would boast,
    <br>"Oh boy, which one?" - "Number two has gone!"
    <br>Only for God's sake.
    <br>God loved me. If not, by now I'm sure I would have been dead.
    <br>For the abuse I gave to myself.
    <br>Thinking back now, I was really self-centred.
    <br>I never really gave a thought to my wife about what I was doing.
    <br>It was really a very bad life.
    <br>I'd like to ask your wife a question at this point.
    <br>Your husband said you caught him many times, even red-handed.
    <br>In fact, almost all the time.
    <br>Did you ever consider leaving him when you caught him in such a scenario?
    <br>No.
    <br>Why? What strengthened you?
    <br>My own brain game because I attended a seminary school,
    <br>and it really helped me knowing the Lord.
    <br>And I knew when we came together, I had to pray because of the challenges in the marriage.
    <br>He is from Orugu, I'm from Igbo.
    <br>You hardly see a Yoruba man, being the first son, marrying outside.
    <br>So there were a lot of challenges before we came together.
    <br>Sometimes my friends would say, "Won't you leave him? Orugu people will kill you!"
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Then I started putting it into prayer.
    <br>And I then noticed...
    <br>Even during that period, in year 1, I had it very hot with the family.
    <br>It wasn't an easy journey.
    <br>At the time, instead of going for my lectures, we were together, we were like friends.
    <br>Like he rightly said, we courted for some time.
    <br>So I started going to church, trying to seek the face of the Lord.
    <br>In fact, instead of going to lectures, when there were challenges, I would go to church.
    <br>Sometimes this apostolic - you would follow the congregation and then a message would come,
    <br>"You're crying, what did you do?
    <br>God said you didn't do anything. He will fight the battle".
    <br>In fact, all these messages that were coming made me to stay put.
    <br>So all the challenges - it wasn't an easy journey.
    <br>If you don't know the Lord, you will collapse. Yes.
    <br>So when we started, he was really a nice person - at that early time.
    <br>When I just came back from the UK.
    <br>Very nice.
    <br>So at the time, when we got married, the house was very hot.
    <br>I said, "What is going on?"
    <br>Each time he went clubbing; when he came back to the house, it was just to have his bath and then off again.
    <br>He changed and then off again.
    <br>I asked, "Won't you eat?" He said, "No, no!"
    <br>By the time he came back, maybe around nine or ten, he would say, "Where is my food?"
    <br>Or sometimes there would be food on the dining table, he would say, "No, no!"
    <br>I would say, "You see what you are doing to yourself", and he would go upstairs.
    <br>Even in the marriage, I lost two kids.
    <br>I lost the first one, the second one was dead, and I lost the third one.
    <br>When I was pregnant for the fourth one, I remember one experience - a very sad experience.
    <br>He was going out in the morning. He came because I saw him with a lady.
    <br>In the morning I said, "Who was that person?"
    <br>He said, "Must I know everybody?"
    <br>I said, "You are not going anywhere".
    <br>So when I said you're not going anywhere, he pushed me with the pregnancy.
    <br>I fell.
    <br>So when I fell, I stood up.
    <br>He said, "I will go and report you to your parents, if you want somebody that will kill you".
    <br>I'm sure you are feeling bad.
    <br>He said, "If you want somebody that will kill his mommy, go to your parents and die there".
    <br>I left him.
    <br>So when I left him, my spirit said - because before then, each time I complained to his mother,
    <br>since they didn't like me then - that was then -
    <br>so each time I complained, they would say, "Ehe".
    <br>His mum told me one day, "My husband married three - from polygamous home. I didn't kill him.
    <br>So you will not kill my son because of women. If you don't want to stay, go!"
    <br>So because of that, I now stopped complaining.
    <br>So when he did that to me, when he pushed me, I told myself...
    <br>All these things that had been happening, I refused to tell my own people
    <br>because I knew they loved him. I didn't want them to hate him -
    <br>for them to feel that he was treating me badly.
    <br>I was keeping it all to myself, praying.
    <br>So when he pushed me, one spirit said, "Don't push him, leave him!
    <br>Just focus on God. God will change him
    <br>If you continue like this, you will get yourself hurt. You'll be hurting yourself.
    <br>Leave him. The battle is not yours; it is the Lord's".
    <br>The Spirit of God kept talking inside of me.
    <br>Each time the Spirit of God talked to me, I would relax.
    <br>So that day when he came back, I was lying down on the floor in the sitting room.
    <br>He left that morning and came back around 6:00.
    <br>I was expecting him to say like, "Are you okay?" He didn't talk to me. He just walked on.
    <br>Each time I would be the one to meet him to say, "It's okay"
    <br>because I knew he was ever ready to dump me to move ahead with his life.
    <br>So it would be me to break the silence.
    <br>And you cannot continue this way because anything that will bring enmity will go to God.
    <br>God will not hear you.
    <br>Each time I would still be the one going to him, saying, "Okay. That one has past. It is okay".
    <br>I would waive it.
    <br>So we continued like that.
    <br>There were instances - they were too many.
    <br>There was one time, during one of the periods that I lost a baby, pregnancy was not coming.
    <br>I stayed up to five years (without getting pregnant).
    <br>Pregnancy was not coming.
    <br>I had just lost that baby like a month.
    <br>I went to my doctor at Aba - from Port Harcourt to Aba.
    <br>That morning he dressed up. He was going to the presidential palace to give a talk.
    <br>I said, "You are looking good". He said, "Thank you".
    <br>When I left, he gave me money to go and see my doctor.
    <br>I came back in the evening around 4:00.
    <br>From the taxi I was in, I saw him.
    <br>They drove past.
    <br>The girl was sitting this way, facing him.
    <br>In my mind I said, "What is this.
    <br>Look at you now. You've come to look at him enjoying himself. It is well".
    <br>So I went home.
    <br>As I was there, one of my friends came that her husband was doing the same thing.
    <br>She just came to me and said, "Mrs Shaka, when my husband comes, today A.
    <br>In fact, today, we will fight".
    <br>I said, "Fight? Why?"
    <br>She said, "This man - carrying women!"
    <br>I said, "Hmm".
    <br>So we were discussing and I was counselling her, "Leave it! Pray for him!"
    <br>As we were talking, I told her about the one I had seen that very day.
    <br>"I went to Aba for treatment. I saw him coming.
    <br>He went to the presidential palace, and I saw him when he was coming back".
    <br>She said, "What is with all these men?" We laughed.
    <br>We were discussing when my husband came.
    <br>He parked his car in the garage and then entered.
    <br>I said, "Honey, welcome".
    <br>He said, "Thank you".
    <br>I said, "You stayed long. Is it that since this morning, you just finished?"
    <br>He said, "Yes". That was around 7:00.
    <br>He said, "Yes, we just closed now".
    <br>So the lady looked at my face. I looked at her as soon as he went upstairs.
    <br>She said, "Wow. You are doing well. You mean since 4 o'clock that you saw him?"
    <br>I said, "Yes. Now he will go and arrange himself".
    <br>She said, "If it were me, as he entered, I would grab him".
    <br>I said, "No, you don't need to do that".
    <br>So it was that very night that I caught him again.
    <br>I said, "This thing you are doing, is it good?
    <br>This morning, you gave me money to go and see my doctor.
    <br>As I was coming back - look at me going - we have only one son.
    <br>Look at me going, pursuing the fruit of the womb.
    <br>Look at you. Look at what you are doing with women. Is it good?
    <br>If it is good before God, it is good before me.
    <br>But if it is not good before God, okay, let Him fight the battle.
    <br>Stop doing this thing".
    <br>Wow. We really salute your patience. We really do.
    <br>Indeed, you felt relaxed. It is all to the glory of God.
    <br>Whenever I talked to him that way - you wouldn't see me shouting.
    <br>The Spirit of God said, "Don't shout. It is not your battle.
    <br>Continue talking to him. I will fight it for you".
    <br>Each time I would talk to him gently, nicely.
    <br>I would say, "It is not good".
    <br>He would be sober.
    <br>He would say, "I'm sorry".
    <br>I would say, "It's okay. Bring your hand".
    <br>I would hold his hand and pray for him.
    <br>I would say, "Stop doing these things. Let us see where God will take us".
    <br>He would say, "Okay".
    <br>After that "okay", he would leave that particular one.
    <br>Anyone I discovered, he would leave that one.
    <br>And go to another one.
    <br>I realised that when I got that one, he would leave that one.
    <br>I would tell him, "You drive this one away and then jump here to this one".
    <br>I would be teasing him with it.
    <br>Sometimes too, instead of quarrelling when he got home...
    <br>Sometimes, when he saw that I had caught him, I would call him and say, "Where are you?"
    <br>He would say, "I'm going to the club." Then I would say, "I'm coming to the club too to drink".
    <br>He would then say, "No, no. I'm not in the club. My car got spoiled".
    <br>I would say, "You see your life! You cannot hide it from God!"
    <br>I would sing that song.
    <br>When he came back, I would say, "You see yourself? All these girls!
    <br>The day I will catch them, I will squeeze their heads".
    <br>He would say, "Don't mind them - all these stupid girls!
    <br>So I now turned it to a game so that I would not hurt myself.
    <br>He would say, "Mummy, don't worry - all these girls".
    <br>It is exactly what your husband was saying earlier.
    <br>It was a spirit behind it.
    <br>I knew that it was a spirit.
    <br>That was why I noticed that my rate of progress was going down.
    <br>I was not living up to expectations.
    <br>I was supposed to be a high flyer but I was not making progress.
    <br>My sister-in-law noticed it also because she came to the house.
    <br>Most of the time, they loved me - my in-laws.
    <br>Instead of calling me by name, they were calling me "Unlce Femi". They were very fond of me.
    <br>She was asking me, "What is wrong? Why is your promotion so delayed?"
    <br>I said, "I don't know.
    <br>She then asked, "Are you aware of Emmanuel TV?"
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>She then said, "You need to install it in the house and be watching it".
    <br>That is one of the things that I most credit my wife with: She is very determined.
    <br>Shortly after that, she installed Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We started watching it, keenly.
    <br>We saw the wonderful things that God was using His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>to achieve amongst His people.
    <br>Like I have said, because I come from a Christian family background,
    <br>I saw immediately that I needed to seek spiritual direction.
    <br>I knew that there was something pushing me.
    <br>It was like someone smoking - the more the person promises he is going to stop smoking,
    <br>the more the spirit of smoking would take hold of the person.
    <br>This was the kind of thing I was going through.
    <br>We watched Emmanuel TV in our house for nearly one year
    <br>before I ventured to travel to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I came, I had the opportunity of getting the Morning Water.
    <br>I went back home with it.
    <br>We would say a prayer,
    <br>and at the end of the prayer, I would administer the Morning Water on each member of the family.
    <br>When it reached my turn, I would confess all my sins - before my family, my mother-in-law.
    <br>That I  was a fornicator, drunkard, that I was not doing my family duties,
    <br>that I wasn't a good father to my children. I had to confess all my sins.
    <br>My mother-in-law was laughing at me, "You are funny!"
    <br>I said, "I'm not funny because I must put this devil to shame!"
    <br>So to discrace this spirit?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Each night he would pray, "God of T.B. Joshua, help me!
    <br>Every spirit of fornication and adultery, not being faithful to my dear wife, every spirit - out!"
    <br>All these things you were hiding came out.
    <br>The way he shouted, all of us would say, "That spirit - out, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>You were doing mass prayer in your house!
    <br>Very shortly after that, after about two months - I kept on praying
    <br>but I did not notice that I had not been going to the club.
    <br>Just like that.
    <br>It kept on going like this for three months. Then people started calling me, "What is happening?
    <br>We don't see you at the club nowadays!"
    <br>I said, "It is because of work!"
    <br>This went on for six months.
    <br>Then it became clear that something was really happening.
    <br>Then I started not to feel the urge for going to the club, taking alcohol.
    <br>It just stopped.
    <br>The urge just left.
    <br>My former girlfriends lined up - they would call and call.
    <br>I'm sure they are watching now. You see? I'm born-again!
    <br>I'm delivered.
    <br>They kept calling and calling.
    <br>I sent most of them text messages, "Please, I'm born-again!"
    <br>Most of them didn't believe it because I was really bad.
    <br>I was living a bad life.
    <br>It went on like that.
    <br>They noticed that when the second examiner came,
    <br>I would take the person down to the club to buy them a drink - we would take maltina.
    <br>That was still initially. After that, I never went again to the club, at all.
    <br>It was February last year that I celebrated my wife.
    <br>I said, "Do you know that this is the first time since I married you that I can really say
    <br>that I'm celebrating Valentine's day without having seen another woman for one year".
    <br>And I said, "Wow, God is great!"
    <br>Since then, I have been having a peaceful home - a settled home.
    <br>I'm at peace with myself and I keep asking myself, "What the hell was I doing in the club?"
    <br>About January - Febuary last year, a group of young men in the faculty came to me and said,
    <br>"Prof, you have to be our next dean".
    <br>I said, "Me?"
    <br>So they laughed.
    <br>Before I knew it, they went and picked forms, filled forms, printed posters.
    <br>This happened on my behalf.
    <br>I couldn't help but joining them.
    <br>He didn't pay a dime.
    <br>They paid the money. They said, "You must be our next dean!"
    <br>In fairness, they knew that I was always very fair and firm on any issue.
    <br>I never really liked people that suppressed younger colleagues for no reason.
    <br>So they were determined that I should be the next dean.
    <br>But I knew that I was also a minority.
    <br>To tell you that God of T.B. Joshua was really involved in my affairs, has taken hold of my affairs,
    <br>after separating me from the club, drunkenness, womanising and everything,
    <br>I was now ready to go.
    <br>We went into the election.
    <br>On the very day of the election, the godfather - the one they referred to as godfather -
    <br>he called the two River State indigenous candidates who were contesting against me.
    <br>He said, "One of them should step down".
    <br>Of course they refused, which meant that their vote was split.
    <br>And that gave me the honour, by the grace of God of T.B. Joshua, to win the election by just one vote.
    <br>Just one vote.
    <br>I think I got about 156, and the second person 155.
    <br>It wasn't the senate one.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>The first person got 46; the second person 59.
    <br>And you got 60.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>So that's it.
    <br>That's how I won that election, and I knew that the hand of God was upon my life.
    <br>That same year, we had...
    <br>Before that - during the campaigning for that election, he didn't go to the club.
    <br>It was a year after the transformation.
    <br>When they came, the people campaigning for them would ask them in the club,
    <br>"The person you are campaigning for is not coming? You are the one doing it".
    <br>Each time they came to the house, I would tell the campaign manager -
    <br>he would call me, "Are you praying?" and I would say, "Yes.
    <br>But there is one thing I want to tell you: A builder builds in vain without God,
    <br>A watchman watches in vain without God.
    <br>So you campaign in vain without God.
    <br>So as you are campaigning, make sure you involve God".
    <br>Wow. And truly God was involved!
    <br>So the breakthrough you were looking for, for many years, was coming!
    <br>And after I won that election, I received NUC accreditation.
    <br>The Nigerian University Commission is the federal government agency
    <br>that is in charge of regulating programmes in Nigerian universities.
    <br>If your programme is not approved, accredited, you cannot teach that course.
    <br>So I had eight departments that were undergoing NUC accreditation.
    <br>My faculty is made up of nine departments.
    <br>One was already accredited. So I had eight departments (undergoing accreditation).
    <br>We were living in a rickety facult building.
    <br>We had a new, uncompleted faculty building that was in the bush.
    <br>When I told them that I was going to move into that faculty building,
    <br>those guys laughed and said, "How can you say that we should move into this forest?
    <br>That is not possible!"
    <br>I went to meet the Vice Chancellor.
    <br>Luckily, he saw my vision and said, "The money we were going to give to you, we will split it in two.
    <br>We will give half to the contractor to complete the building, and you can move into it.
    <br>That was exactly what happened.
    <br>Even when he won that election - each time we prayed with the Morning Water -
    <br>because he went in with two points that he would move them to the faculty building
    <br>and he would give them full accreditation.
    <br>Other people campaigned with calumny. I told him, "Don't campaign against anybody.
    <br>Just tell them what you want to do for them".
    <br>I was telling the campaign manager, "Just tell them what you want to do for them.
    <br>Don't campaign against anybody".
    <br>When he then won, the next thing for God to do was to complete these other things.
    <br>So we would change our prayer points. Each time, we kept on changing them.
    <br>I would tell him, "This is the prayer point".
    <br>Because befor the elction, each time he was praying, I would say, "No, this one!
    <br>This is a selfish prayer. Say, God, let them know that you can.
    <br>Who told you you are the only qualified person! You will change it!"
    <br>When we started praying, "God of T.B. Joshua, let Your favour and mercy speak for us.
    <br>But above all, let Your will be done!"
    <br>So when he won that election, we then had to change the prayer point -
    <br>about the building, establishing those things.
    <br>We then said, "God, establish your finger. Tell them that You are the one that made him dean with one vote".
    <br>We then started praying for the faculty building.
    <br>I was doing my prayers at midnight - every Friday I do prayers at midnight.
    <br>Yes, twelve to three.
    <br>During that midnight prayer, she heard a voice saying, "Embargo".
    <br>During the midnight prayer, I heard, "Embargo".
    <br>I rushed up and woke him up. I said, "There is an embargo in that". We started praying.
    <br>"There is an embargo - a spiritual embargo - so that you will not be able to move there."
    <br>So we now took the Morning Water.
    <br>And administered it.
    <br>I said, "We will fast today - no food this Saturday".
    <br>All of us declared a fast.
    <br>"After the fasting, we will use the Morning Water, and then you take me to that building.
    <br>Let me see that building." A massive building inside the bush.
    <br>We finished with the Morning Water and climbed up.
    <br>I said, "You are the dean. Make a declaration.
    <br>The Bible says, Decree a thing and it shall come to pass.
    <br>So degree! Take!" I gave him the Morning Water.
    <br>We started administering it and then left.
    <br>After praying over the embargo, I was called by the Vice Chancellor.
    <br>Money was released to the contractor.
    <br>Some time this year, around February-March, the Vice Chancellor called most of his friends.
    <br>We gathered at his place.
    <br>We were drinking and relaxing. He then said, "There are council elections upcoming".
    <br>He wanted a quiet administration - an administration that is progress-driven,
    <br>with a focus on academic growth of the university.
    <br>He wanted people who could really join him in the vision he was trying to pursue for the university.
    <br>He was encouraging us that we should not sit on the fence.
    <br>That most of us should run for membership of the governing council.
    <br>So he started mentioning names. He mentioned three names.
    <br>And one of the persons he mentioned said, "Shaka".
    <br>And he said, "Yes, and Shaka".
    <br>I said to myself, "Wow, look at me!" I just came because I was invited.
    <br>I had thought it was just a meeting of friends.
    <br>Now, I had gotten nominated as a member of the governing council.
    <br>I went into that election and of course, I won again.
    <br>This time I knew that the hand of God was upon my life.
    <br>So what an incredible transformation!
    <br>It is a spiritual, physical, marital transformation!
    <br>We just give all the glory to God.
    <br>I think, sir, that you are in the position to give advice to our viewers all over the world,
    <br>watching you right now. What would you tell them, based on your life experiences?
    <br>What I would advise them is: Any person living a wayward life,
    <br>there is no way you can use will power to change your life.
    <br>You have to submit your life totally to God.
    <br>As evangelists at The SCOAN often say, "Go to any living church" - fine!
    <br>But I want to say that when you have tried all the living churches and they have failed you,
    <br>please come to Lagos - come down here and seek the face of God.
    <br>This is where I got my liberation, and this is where I will recommend.
    <br>If you are living a wayward life, staying more at clubs, drinking from one club to another,
    <br>womanising and you can't help yourself, please seek the face of God.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Madam, what is your best advice you would also give to a spouse
    <br>whose partner is having a destructive addiction?
    <br>Ok. My advice is: They should depend on God.
    <br>They cannot do it on their own. They can't change them.
    <br>We cannot change them.
    <br>I was unable to change my husband but I depended on God,
    <br>knowing full well that He is the author and finisher of our faith.
    <br>And again He says, "I am the God of all flesh. Is there anything too difficult for me to do?"
    <br>Absolutely nothing!
    <br>I would also advise spouses that they should always forgive their spouse.
    <br>They should forgive. They should not hold anything against them
    <br>because it is just like you are holding somebody or yourself.
    <br>If you hold somebody like this, you too are not free - you are holding yourself.
    <br>Release them with forgiveness so that you too will be free.
    <br>Madam, you can obviously confirm the changes in your husband's life
    <br>since his deliverance and freedom.
    <br>Yes, a lot of changes.
    <br>Not going to the club.
    <br>Now, from the office you can boastfully say that at 4 or 5pm, daddy is at home.
    <br>And when he comes back to the house, he doesn't go anywhere.
    <br>Except maybe we are going for fellowship or any other outing that is not clubbing or woman-matter.
    <br>A lot of changes. In fact, God is faithful.
    <br>He is indeed faithful.
    <br>And the best thing that can happen to a family is when both of the couple are in the Lord,
    <br>when you are working together.
    <br>Not this one doing his own, this other person doing her own.
    <br>When the two minds are together, you will see that you will get there.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Sometimes I would tell him, "You see, daddy, that God is faithful.
    <br>See the way the Lord is beautifying us. You see it because you are no longer doing those acts.
    <br>And each time I kept telling you that God will separate impurities before He will take you".
    <br>She was fond of telling me that.
    <br>Look at it! He has really separated impurities!
    <br>To God be the glory! And what about the relationship with the children?
    <br>The relationship - you see the children being very playful.
    <br>In fact, they are now even closer to him than to myself.
    <br>When he is back from work, you will see the childrein coming, "Daddy, I love you".
    <br>"Daddy, welcome."
    <br>You will see the closeness - they are closer to him than to myself now.
    <br>To Him be the glory!
    <br>That is why we are here - changing lives! The evidence of Christ Jesus is indeed lives changed.
    <br>Actually, a lot of viewers around the world watched your testimony
    <br>and were really touched with what the Lord has done for you.
    <br>So we have a couple of questions, just to round up the programme.
    <br>I have a question for Professor Femi here.
    <br>This is from a viewer in Zambia.
    <br>Alinvia in Zambia asks, "What is your message to the academicians
    <br>whose scientific frame of mind has often led them to doubt the reality of God's power?"
    <br>So there is an academic world like you find yourself in. What would be your message to them?
    <br>Well, I was very touched a couple of days ago when one of the evangelists came to preach to us.
    <br>That the chemical components that make up the human flesh have been scientifically proven.
    <br>That we are made up of sand. That is where we come from.
    <br>Science cannot solve the mysteries of this world.
    <br>I mean, I recollect that when I was in New York and went to the planetarium,
    <br>where you undertake a tour of the planets.
    <br>And I asked myself, "So if the scientists can imagine all these stars in our galaxy alone,
    <br>that you can't count, what makes you think that you can solve the riddle of God's creation?"
    <br>So science cannot answer all our questions.
    <br>We need to get back to God - the origin of our being and creation.
    <br>It does not mean that you will not ask scientific questions
    <br>but you must have God at the background and basis of your enquiry.
    <br>If not, you will get involved in things that will make you to doubt the existence of God
    <br>and that will be on the part of perdition.
    <br>Thank you very much for that.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We also have another question from our viewers.
    <br>It is actually a funny question.
    <br>It goes to you, madam.
    <br>It is from Betty. She says she is from Colorado in the United States.
    <br>She asks, "What stopped you from rebelling when you saw lipstick marks on your husband?"
    <br>Funny, indeed.
    <br>Because I knew he wasn't the one doing it.
    <br>I knew it was the spirit being.
    <br>I could not fight him but the spirit being.
    <br>Since I knew I could not fight the spirit being - it is God who can fight the spirit being -
    <br>so I moved it through that way in prayer.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Wow, thank you. That is exactly what Prophet T.B. Joshua says,
    <br>"That if we fail to realise that there are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage,
    <br>we will continue to fight the wrong battle.
    <br>- It is the wrong battle. 
    <br>- It is happening in many many homes today.
    <br>Fighting, quarrelling will bring tension in the house so there is no need.
    <br>Exactly. Wow. We really salute your faith, madam.
    <br>We thank God that today, testimony has resulted.
    <br>In fact, what changed him is because of me.
    <br>I have always called her the pastor of the family.
    <br>Because God really wanted to restore my peace.
    <br>So that was why He changed him.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>And you have actually made the right choice.
    <br>Because like the Bible says, The greatest decision you can make in life is to put your trust in God.
    <br>And that is what you have actually done. And He has actually seen you through everything.
    <br>That is one of my prayer points.
    <br>I pray it every day: Let nothing shake my confidence in Him!
    <br>Amen. Thank you so much, Professor Femi and Madam.
    <br>Thank you so much for joining us in 'Changing Lives'.
    <br>We believe that your experience has really blessed our viewers, and we thank you so much once again.
    <br>And also the best is yet to come in the family!
    <br>Better is not good enough, the best is yet to come!
    <br>CHANGING LIVES
    <br>In the course of this programme, we believe you have discovered the reality
    <br>that until you experience God, there will be dissatisfaction in your life.
    <br>No matter your status or stature in this world.
    <br>Indeed, viewers. You realised that education is good and wonderful but education is not success.
    <br>It is just to help us to get success when we carry God along.
    <br>And as Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "If your hand is filled with money,
    <br>and your head is filled with information, and your heart is empty,
    <br>then your life is very empty.
    <br>You realised today that so many people try to create happiness for themselves with the things around them.
    <br>But joy is something only believers have because joy is a fruit of faith.
    <br>And we are talking about the kind of joy that nothing in this world can destroy.
    <br>And that is the kind of joy that we as Christians ought to have.
    <br>As the Bible says in the book of John 14:27, "The peace Christ gives is not of this world".
    <br>Therefore, you should not trade your joy or peace for anything this world has to offer.
    <br>Exactly. So viewers around the world, let today's programme encourage you.
    <br>That no matter your situation - don't focus on what is happening in the world around you -
    <br>let your heart rise and seek the things that are above
    <br>and you will be richly blessed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank you so much for joining us on today's episode of 'Changing LIves'.
