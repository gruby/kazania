  <p>    
    <br>Let's quickly look at our text - the Book of Hebrews 4:1.
    <br>"Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest,
    <br>let us fear lest any of you seems to have come short of it.
    <br>For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them;
    <br>but the word which they heard did not profit them,
    <br>not being mixed with faith in those who heard it."
    <br>There is word and there is word of faith.
    <br>This is the reason why the word did not profit them.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Verse 3:
    <br>"For we who have believed do enter that rest..."
    <br>Take note of "that rest".
    <br>They are not saying "this rest" - take note of that.
    <br>"...as He has said:
    <br>'So, I swore in My wrath, "They shall not enter My rest", '
    <br>although the works were finished from the foundation of the world."
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Let me take verse 11.
    <br>"Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest,
    <br>lest anyone falls according to the same example of disobedience.
    <br>For the word of God is living and powerful,
    <br>and sharper than any two-edged sword.
    <br>And there is no creature hidden from His sight,
    <br>but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him
    <br>to whom we must give account."
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of James 2:14.
    <br>"What does it profit, my brethren,
    <br>if someone says he has faith but does not have works?
    <br>Can faith save him?"
    <br>That is verse 14.
    <br>I'm taking you to verse 22 now.
    <br>"Do you see that faith was working together with his works,
    <br>and by works faith was made perfect?"
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>We take this title:
    <br>WORKS OF FAITH
    <br>Let someone say, "Works of faith".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Works without faith are dead.
    <br>In the same way, faith without works is dead.
    <br>The title: WORKS OF FAITH
    <br>The unique place where faith is expressed is in our works.
    <br>If faith and works do not agree with each other,
    <br>there must be something wrong with the faith.
    <br>There is faith in faith, faith in your belief
    <br>and faith, which we are here for, in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let someone say, "Works of faith".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Faith is expressed through His works.
    <br>Faith is expressed through His works
    <br>because our works perfect our faith.
    <br>Our works complete our faith.
    <br>It means, your faith is not complete without works.
    <br>Faith worked together with His works.
    <br>Without works, faith is dead.
    <br>What we do expresses what we believe.
    <br>"This man is not a Christian..."
    <br>What he does expresses what he believes.
    <br>You cannot be killing or stealing and believe in restoration.
    <br>If you believe God in a certain matter,
    <br>you should have a work of faith in that matter.
    <br>If not, you deceive yourself; your faith is fake, false.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you believe God in a certain matter,
    <br>you should have a work of faith in that matter."
    <br>Otherwise, your faith will not help you to receive God's deliverance.
    <br>WORKS OF FAITH
    <br>Take note of the title.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If there is faith, as you confess,
    <br>there must be works that correspond with the faith."
    <br>So, because they say, "I have faith in God"...
    <br>Faith without works is dead.
    <br>If truly what you confess to people, "I have faith" - OK.
    <br>If there is faith, there must be works that correspond with the faith.
    <br>That is, to agree.
    <br>If you commit a certain matter to God,
    <br>your attitude towards that matter will surely see a great change.
    <br>"I have a headache", and I say to God, "God will heal me, I believe Him" -
    <br>it does not end there.
    <br>That attitude now is what we call "work".
    <br>The Bible says, when one believes, he will have rest.
    <br>That is what the Book of Hebrews 4:3 said.
    <br>For we who have believed enter into the rest.
    <br>Faith and rest cannot be separated from one another.
    <br>If I say I believe God for a certain matter, what follows?
    <br>You believe Him to deliver you, yet busily making plans,
    <br>being worried and distressed.
    <br>What kind of belief is that?
    <br>That is false faith.
    <br>Whenever we truly believe, our hearts will be at rest.
    <br>If our hearts are uneasy,
    <br>if we are afraid of this and that,
    <br>if we are fearful and feeling lost,
    <br>then, this means, we show no faith;
    <br>we show that we have not believed yet.
    <br>The first step of our work of faith is to stop our own works
    <br>and rest in God's love, wisdom and power.
    <br>What is our own work?
    <br>"I believe God because of miracles.
    <br>I'm here because of miracles.
    <br>I believe Him because of blessings."
    <br>That is our own belief.
    <br>That is faith in faith, faith in our belief.
    <br>If a man believes that a house is on fire, he will surely not sit still in the house.
    <br>So also, we Christians, when we commit a certain issue to the Lord
    <br>and we believe He will work for us,
    <br>our attitude towards the matter will surely see a great change.
    <br>You pray over a certain matter that worries your life
    <br>and you find yourself still worried over it,
    <br>still going to earthly sources for relief.
    <br>That is not faith.
    <br>That is a form of unbelief.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>That is a form of unbelief.
    <br>Examine your daily life;
    <br>you will find out how much faith you have in your business, career, marital life.
    <br>Examine it!
    <br>TB Joshua REVEALS The Secrets Of Faith!
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Mark 5.
    <br>Let me read verses 25 and 34.
    <br>"Now a certain woman had a flow of blood
    <br>and had suffered many things from many physicians.
    <br>She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse."
    <br>Verse 34:
    <br>"And He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has made you well.
    <br>Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction'."
    <br>He said, "My daughter, your faith has made you whole, healed you. Go in peace."
    <br>That is the word "faith".
    <br>Let's take the Book of Mark 10:52.
    <br>"Then Jesus said to him, 'Go your way; your faith has made you well'."
    <br>And immediately... - can you see the power of faith?
    <br>When faith works together with works.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[When faith works together with works.]
    <br>Can you see what happens?
    <br>So powerful.
    <br>"And immediately he received his sight."
    <br>In this case, faith worked together with works to bring this.
    <br>Without works, faith cannot move mountains.
    <br>You hear yourself and people around you will hear you
    <br>but God will not hear you without works.
    <br>Desperate circumstances trigger desperate faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Desperate circumstances trigger desperate faith.]
    <br>In her desperation, she reached with desperate faith.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>In her desperation, she reached with desperate faith.
    <br>Desperate circumstances trigger desperate faith.
    <br>When you run out of rope,
    <br>it is time to grab onto faith.
    <br>The only hope for you:
    <br>If I don't hold this, I will likely fall.
    <br>Now, I have run out of it.
    <br>What next?
    <br>Grab what?
    <br>Grab onto faith - that is the only way.
    <br>If not - down.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you run out of rope, it is time to grab onto faith".
    <br>A situation where medical doctors say, "This is one week. Go and write your will",
    <br>and you have seen many people with the same disease, being killed.
    <br>What else again?
    <br>You have run out of rope.
    <br>It is time to grab onto faith.
    <br>The woman in question had spent so much; all hope was lost.
    <br>All she could see were sandals.
    <br>In the old days, they were wearing sandals.
    <br>She could not see anything.
    <br>All she could see were sandals and dusty feet.
    <br>She did not give up.
    <br>She kept saying, "I will live life again; I will be healed.
    <br>I will live life again; I will be whole."
    <br>She kept saying this to herself.
    <br>TB Joshua REVEALS The Secrets Of Faith!
    <br>It is time to get at the enemy and fight it up.
    <br>And the enemy is the disease.
    <br>It is time to do something different to change your life from failure to success.
    <br>Sometimes, we get to the end of ourselves
    <br>before God can mould us into glory.
    <br>The woman with the issue of blood.
    <br>Imagine how she felt when she saw the hem of Jesus' garment and touched it.
    <br>"It is what I have been looking for, for so long."
    <br>There was so much crowd.
    <br>Just think about that.
    <br>Imagine how she felt when she saw the hem of Jesus' garment.
    <br>Jesus turned back and said, "Who touched Me?"
    <br>And there were so many people touching Him.
    <br>But it was a different kind of touch.
    <br>It was a desperate and faith touch.
    <br>Jesus said, "Who touched Me?"
    <br>The disciples looked at Jesus and said,
    <br>"Many are touching You. A lot of people touched You."
    <br>Jesus said, "No! It was a different kind of touch".
    <br>What a crazy crowd the Bible described!
    <br>What a crazy crowd!
    <br>Jesus was thronged by the crowd.
    <br>There was no room to move; everywhere was crowded.
    <br>People were everywhere.
    <br>TB Joshua REVEALS The Secrets Of Faith!
    <br>Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has made you whole".
    <br>This woman did four things from which we can learn.
    <br>1. She heard about Jesus.
    <br>What does this mean to you?
    <br>We need to have ears to hear.
    <br>Many have ears but do not hear.
    <br>We need to have ears to hear.
    <br>This woman heard about Jesus; and she was from another country, another town.
    <br>She heard about Jesus and she came.
    <br>She came and she believed.
    <br>She never entered the town and began to ask other apostles,
    <br>"The man called Jesus - was it a trick?
    <br>The man called Jesus - I saw, I heard - could this be a true story about Him?
    <br>The man called Jesus - was it really real?" - No!
    <br>Because she heard about Jesus.
    <br>We must have a heart decision.
    <br>We need to have ears to hear.
    <br>The woman heard about Jesus and she found Him.
    <br>She said in her heart,
    <br>"If I can just touch Him, if I can just get to Him, I will be healed."
    <br>We must have a heart decision.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You must have a heart decision".
    <br>All the decisions you are making are "by tongue".
    <br>You copy people.
    <br>When others do this, you do that, when others jump, you jump.
    <br>This woman said in her heart, "If I can just get to Him, I will be healed."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We must have a heart decision and faith is from the heart."
    <br>Faith is a heart that believes God through ordinary circumstances.
    <br>Our heart is a communication point, contact point where God lives.
    <br>Not tongue, not body, not book, not idea, not influence, not feeling...
    <br>You must have a heart decision before you can make it in life.
    <br>TB Joshua REVEALS The Secrets Of Faith!
    <br>She did not give up.
    <br>She kept saying to herself, "I will live life again; I will be healed.
    <br>I will live life again; I will be blessed."
    <br>This was a decision, a heart decision.
    <br>TB Joshua REVEALS The Secrets Of Faith!
    <br>You must have a heart decision.
    <br>When you begin to have this, your life begins to change.
    <br>Because all what you are doing is on the outside.
    <br>Everything about you is on the outside.
    <br>You copy people everywhere you go.
    <br>People buy this - you want to buy the same,
    <br>people plait hair like this - you want to plait it.
    <br>Many are sitting down in the church, looking at the different attires;
    <br>when they leave from here, they want to buy the same attire.
    <br>Issue of faith is not like that.
    <br>You must have a heart decision.
    <br>Sit down; let God speak to your heart.
    <br>Then, you will not look like others.
    <br>WORKS OF FAITH
    <br>We need to have ears to hear.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[We need to have ears to hear.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[We need to have ears to hear.]
    <br>It is not that you don't hear.
    <br>You hear things of experience.
    <br>There is a difference between experiences and faith.
    <br>You don't hear things of faith but you hear things of experience of this world.
    <br>2. She said in her heart, "If I can just get to Him, I will be healed".
    <br>What does this mean to us?
    <br>We must make a heart decision.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word.
