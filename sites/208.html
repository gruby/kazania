  <p>    
    <br>Viewers and those who are inside the church, listen to me.
    <br>Say to yourself: I have tested You and found You reliable and trustworthy.
    <br>Right now, you can give your finances to God,
    <br>your business to God,
    <br>your health to God,
    <br>your spirit to God,
    <br>your career to Him,
    <br>your future to Him.
    <br>Hand over everything to Him.
    <br>If you have tested Him, you will find Him reliable and trustworthy.
    <br>I have tested You and found You reliable and trustworthy.
    <br>Now, I hand over all; I surrender all.
    <br>(I surrender all)
    <br>Raise your hand. Worship Him.
    <br>(I surrender all)
    <br>(All to Thee my blessed Saviour)
    <br>(I surrender all)
    <br>(All to Thee my blessed Saviour)
    <br>(I surrender all)
    <br>Think back to where you have come from.
    <br>When you were an embryo in your mother's womb,
    <br>take your case back and begin to think.
    <br>You will see how many challenges, situations God has actually rescued you from.
    <br>Confess this now and hand over your life to Him.
    <br>I have tested You.
    <br>Oh God, I have tested You.
    <br>I found You reliable and trustworthy.
    <br>Here I am,
    <br>take over my business,
    <br>my career,
    <br>my finances,
    <br>my health,
    <br>my marital life.
    <br>Take over.
    <br>Give it to God.
    <br>Here I am, take over!
    <br>Take over all!
    <br>I SURRENDER ALL!
    <br>Powerful Mass Prayer With T.B. Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your finances are in the hands of God.
    <br>Your health is in the hands of God.
    <br>Your business is in the hands of God.
    <br>I mean, your career is in the hands of God.
    <br>I mean, your destiny is in the hands of God.
    <br>I mean, your family is in the hands of God.
    <br>Be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let your spirit speak to me.
    <br>Release yourself right now.
    <br>Because after finishing praying it will be a sin if you do not get your result,
    <br>because God is at work now.
    <br>God is at work.
    <br>Be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>What are your challenges?
    <br>Is your business in a mess?
    <br>I rescue your business, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>What are your challenges?
    <br>Is your health in a mess?
    <br>Never a sickness, never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Be it cancer,
    <br>be it HIV,
    <br>be it diabetes,
    <br>be it hypertension,
    <br>be it kidney problem -
    <br>be rescued!
    <br>Be cured!
    <br>"He sent forth His Word and cured them".
    <br>Listen to that Word.
    <br>It is written in the Bible in Psalm 107:20, "He sent forth His Word and cured them".
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Be cured!
    <br>Father, where would I be?
    <br>(Where would I be)
    <br>(You only know)
    <br>Let your spirit continue.
    <br>(I'm glad You see through eyes of love)
    <br>(A hopeless case)
    <br>(An empty place)
    <br>(If not for grace)
    <br>(Where would I be)
    <br>Open your lips. Watch your screen.
    <br>(You only know)
    <br>Watch your screen. Open your lips.
    <br>(I'm glad You see through eyes of love)
    <br>Watch your screen. On the floor.
    <br>(A hopeless case)
    <br>(An empty place)
    <br>Open your lips
    <br>Viewers at home, I send God's Word to you.
    <br>(If not for grace)
    <br>Be cured in your spirit!
    <br>Be cured in your soul!

    <br>(An empty place)
    <br>(If not for grace)
    <br>(Where would I be)
    <br>(You only know)
    <br>(I'm glad You see through eyes of love)
    <br>(A hopeless case)
    <br>(An empty place)
    <br>(If not for Your grace)
    <br>(Amazing grace)
    <br>(How sweet the sound)
    <br>(I once was lost)
    <br>(But now I'm found)
    <br>(A hopeless case)
    <br>(An empty place)
    <br>(Oh Lord, if not for Your grace)
    <br>(Amazing grace)
    <br>(How sweet the sound)
    <br>(I was once was lost)
    <br>(But now I'm found)
    <br>(A hopeless case)
    <br>(Oh thank You, Jesus)
    <br>(An empty place)
    <br>(Oh Lord, if not for Your grace)
    <br>(Where would I be)
    <br>(You only know)
    <br>(I'm glad You see through eyes of love)
    <br>(A hopeless case)
    <br>(An empty place)
    <br>(Lord, if not for Your grace)
