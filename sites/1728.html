    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come on, wave your hands and begin to thank Jesus Christ.
    <br>Come on, wave your hands and begin to thank Him.
    <br>Thank Him for overcoming for us.
    <br>Thank Him for interceding for us before the Father.
    <br>Come on, thank Him!
    <br>There are many people on the sickbed right now, unable to move without being helped.
    <br>Here we are moving freely.
    <br>Thank Him!
    <br>That accident, that headache, that poison that you and I survived -
    <br>there are many people who could not survive it.
    <br>Come on, wave your hands and begin to thank Him.
    <br>Thank Him!
    <br>Acknowledge Him!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Acknowledge God!"
    <br>Say, "Acknowledge God for every moment of His attention in your life."
    <br>Begin to acknowledge Him!
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name we pray.
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God and say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We are in the presence of God today to make a difference in our world.
    <br>By 'a difference' I mean carrying God along.
    <br>I want to begin with you this morning by sharing with you my encounter with a lady
    <br>and this will lead us to our message today.
    <br>Few months ago I met a young lady, who believes she can go it all alone,
    <br>without any reference to God.
    <br>She believes so much in externals, in her beauty,
    <br>the amount of money she owns in her bank accounts,
    <br>the car she drives.
    <br>I tried my possible best to let her understand the true meaning of life
    <br>and the importance of looking inwards,
    <br>but I realised that the more I talked, the more bitter she looked.
    <br>She was not willing to listen to the truth.
    <br>She was no longer giving me her attention.
    <br>So I asked her, "Sister, where is your house?"
    <br>Immediately her countenance changed; with a big smile she said to me,
    <br>"Oh evangelist, I would be very glad if you could come to know my house.
    <br>I live on Banana Island, one of the most prestigious areas in Lagos, in a mansion with my family."
    <br>I said, "Wow. So you are not homeless."
    <br>She changed again and said, "I think you are not getting me."
    <br>She looked at me with this kind of a weighed look, "You are not getting me.
    <br>I said, 'I own properties, businesses. I'm at the peak of my career.' "
    <br>Children of God, I want you to know one thing today:
    <br>You can be rich, famous or popular and yet be homeless.
    <br>You can be highly educated, you can be at the peak of your career and yet be homeless.
    <br>You can be a bishop, a pastor, an evangelist,
    <br>you can own the largest congregation with several branches and yet be homeless.
    <br>Homelessness is man's condition without God.
    <br>We are homeless unless the Spirit of the Father dwells in us.
    <br>And that is why Jesus says in John 14:23,
    <br>"If anyone loves Me then he must obey My teaching.
    <br>My Father will love him and We will come and have Our home in him."
    <br>That you are not obeying the Word of God does not mean you cannot be rich.
    <br>That you are not obeying the Word of God does not mean you cannot be well educated.
    <br>That you are not obeying the Word of God does not mean you cannot control the largest crowd.
    <br>Today, many think that the evidence of God in our life is the fact that we are rich.
    <br>Many think that the evidence of God in their lives
    <br>is the fact that they are famous, popular, highly educated.
    <br>NO!
    <br>Remember, a man can be poor and yet be a best friend of God.
    <br>A man can be rejected, disappointed, denied the right to belong
    <br>and yet be the apple of God's eye.
    <br>Whereas a man can be rich - very, very rich - and yet not have a relationship with God.
    <br>Think about this.
    <br>What makes us what we are is not the result but the right processing.
    <br>It is not about the result but going through the right processing.
    <br>There are many rich men but there is a rich man.
    <br>Anyone can be rich; what makes the difference is the right processing -
    <br>of whom you are the source.
    <br>That is why we see many people with poor results, despite having good jobs.
    <br>Whereas there are many first class graduates looking to get a job.
    <br>That is why we see so-called "most ugly people" getting married
    <br>to the most beautiful and handsome people without stress.
    <br>Whereas there are many beautiful and handsome people who are struggling
    <br>to get someone to settle down with.
    <br>What makes us what we are matters most.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "What makes us what we are, what makes you what you are matters most."
    <br>This brings me to the title of this message:
    <br>RIGHT PROCESSING MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Right processing makes the difference".
    <br>Just as right ingredients make up a good soup, right processing makes the difference.
    <br>What is the process of your life?
    <br>I mean, how did you become what you are?
    <br>Ask yourself: How did I become what I am?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>What are you?
    <br>Are you a businessperson?
    <br>How you became that businessperson today matters most.
    <br>Are you a minister?
    <br>How you became a minister will determine how effective you will be in the face of adversity.
    <br>Are you a politician?
    <br>How you became a politician will determine
    <br>how you will keep your campaign promises to your people -
    <br>I mean, the right processing.
    <br>Whatever profession you may be in,
    <br>how you became what you are will determine how long you will last
    <br>and how you will be rewarded.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Processing makes the difference".
    <br>Let's quickly turn our Bible to the Book of Romans 8
    <br>and let's quickly take our reading from verse 1.
    <br>The Book of Romans chapter 8 and let us begin from verse 1.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
    <br>who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
    <br>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death..."
    <br>Let's go to verse 31.
    <br>"...What then shall we say to these things?
    <br>If God is for us, who can be against us?
    <br>He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
    <br>how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?..."
    <br>Verse 35:
    <br>"...Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?..."
    <br>Verse 38:
    <br>"...For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers,
    <br>nor things present nor things to come,
    <br>nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us
    <br>from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
    <br>Amen.
    <br>What can separate us from the love of God?
    <br>You pray all the time.
    <br>Can anything stop you from praying all the time?
    <br>You go to church.
    <br>What can separate you from going to church?
    <br>Think about the process that you went through to be here today.
    <br>Don't forget that your coming here is not a day journey.
    <br>Should I go or not?
    <br>While many chose to seek the face of God to know the truth,
    <br>many sought the ideas of man before coming.
    <br>"No. I can't go."
    <br>God says, "Go!" but man says, "Don't".
    <br>Many of us are here today because of relationship.
    <br>Ask yourself: What is the reason why I am here today?
    <br>I mean, the right processing.
    <br>I want to share with you two practical examples of things that happen to us
    <br>in the presence of God and we don't take notice of them.
    <br>When we come to the house of God...
    <br>Let me take an example of a woman coming to the house of God;
    <br>as soon as she entered the gate...
    <br>You know the ushers - their job is to move closer and say,
    <br>"Mummy, can you sit here?"
    <br>I want you to take note of these actions and reaction.
    <br>An usher approached the woman saying, "Can you sit here, mummy?"
    <br>And you see the reaction of this woman,
    <br>- "Sit where?"
    <br>- "No, mummy, here."
    <br>- "Me, sit here? Why can't I sit here?"
    <br>- "No, mummy, that place is full."
    <br>- "No. I want to sit where the man of God will see me. You can't tell me where to sit and where not to sit."
    <br>- "Oh mummy please, that place is full. If you can just sit here."
    <br>- "Oh. I rebuke you..."
    <br>People of God, the way we react determines our processing.
    <br>Our attitude depends on our processing.
    <br>I said a lot of things we do and don't take note of them but they matter the most.
    <br>Let me give you another example.
    <br>You see a man making a call while the service is going on
    <br>and you hear him saying, "Oh. Hello. How are you? I'm fine.
    <br>I should come to Abuja tomorrow? Wow. I will come on the first flight tomorrow morning.
    <br>To sign a million-dollar contract? Wow."
    <br>And because the usher noticed that people around him were being distracted,
    <br>the usher said, "Sorry, sir. If you can just move out there and make your call
    <br>because people around you are distracted."
    <br>"You say I should go out there to make my call? Do you know whom I was talking to?
    <br>I was settling a million-dollar contract.
    <br>This money is enough to pay your salary for the rest of your life
    <br>and those you claim are complaining.
    <br>By the way, who are you, usher?"
    <br>How we became what we are depends on our processing.
    <br>Like an adage in my mother tongue, Yoruba, says, "Ki iyan to di iyan, agun isu lodo".
    <br>I will tell you the meaning.
    <br>The meaning is:
    <br>The way we pound determines the kind of pounded yam you will have.
    <br>When your processing is in line with God, nothing can separate you from the love of God.
    <br>Everyone wants to be great but not everyone wants to go through the right processing.
    <br>We want to be blessed, we want to have breakthrough, we want to be healed
    <br>but how many people are willing to go through the right processing?
    <br>Today, when we are looking for a role model we are tempted to look only at externals -
    <br>the beauty, position, popularity, name them -
    <br>and therefore we begin to compare ourselves to others.
    <br>But we fail to realise that one can be rich and yet not have a right standing with God.
    <br>The Book of John 14:27 says that the blessing God gives are not as the world gives.
    <br>The riches, popularity, handsomeness, wealth that God gives are not as the world gives them.
    <br>Today, people bother so much about their cup being half-full,
    <br>a lot of people bother about their cup being half-empty
    <br>but they fail to realise that the cup itself is refillable.
    <br>We don't seem to understand the fact that every year two million people die of dehydration.
    <br>So it doesn't matter whether your cup is half-full or half-empty.
    <br>The most important thing is that there is water in your cup.
    <br>So, the blessings that God gives are not as the world gives them.
    <br>The way and manner we process our lives is what is working for or against us.
    <br>Think about how you have been processing your life.
    <br>You want to get married.
    <br>What is the processing of your marriage?
    <br>Is it in line with God?
    <br>Did you pray about it?
    <br>Are you sure you heard clearly from God or you have not been influenced by external factors?
    <br>If your marriage is in line with God, your marriage will stand the test of time.
    <br>What can separate us from the love of God?
    <br>Nothing! Absolutely nothing, if God's processing is followed.
    <br>We all know that if we want to make a right soup - what do we need to do?
    <br>We need to put together right ingredients.
    <br>Let me quickly share with you an experience I had about two years ago.
    <br>Two years ago a family of mine invited me to their house to have dinner.
    <br>I have been longing to have this meeting with them.
    <br>I said, "I'm going to keep myself for seven hours - I'm going to fast,
    <br>just for me to prepare myself to eat this food".
    <br>I just wanted to be with them - they are family friends of mine.
    <br>I went to their house and we were seated, waiting to eat the dinner.
    <br>The wife came and I was there with her husband and children.
    <br>The wife came and began to serve the food.
    <br>I was desperately hungry, to be honest, waiting to eat the food.
    <br>As soon as I took the first spoon - the food tasted bad.
    <br>I was like, "Maybe it was like that because I have not been eating for the last eight hours".
    <br>I never knew the husband and the children were staring at me.
    <br>I was like, "Let me give a benefit of doubt. Let me take another spoon to know what was happening."
    <br>I took the second spoon.
    <br>Believe me, the food tasted horrible, bad.
    <br>I was like, "What is happening?"
    <br>And here comes the woman with a big smile,
    <br>"Oh sister, did you enjoy the food?"
    <br>I was like, "Enjoy the food?"
    <br>And her husband was seriously looking at me.
    <br>I said to myself, "What will happen here today? I don't know what to say."
    <br>"Oh sister, you enjoyed the food."
    <br>I said, "Sister, you know what, this food tastes bad.
    <br>I'm sorry. It tastes horrible."
    <br>Immediately the husband banked on the table and said,
    <br>"Sister, you are one of the very many guests that we had in this house
    <br>but I tell you, you are the only person that would look straight to my wife and tell her the truth."
    <br>I was like, "Really?"
    <br>He said, "Yes! For a very long time my wife has been cooking very bad food
    <br>but she wouldn't listen.
    <br>Even my children vowed that they were not going to eat mummy's food."
    <br>I was like, "What is happening here?"
    <br>Then this man faced the wife and said, "Look, my dear.
    <br>I'm not going to eat your food anymore if you don't change the ingredients you put together,
    <br>that bring about this.
    <br>I'm not going to eat your food anymore".
    <br>You know what happened...
    <br>I noticed that it was not that the woman was not a good cook.
    <br>She indeed is a good cook but she was putting the wrong ingredients together
    <br>and as a result she was losing the flavour.
    <br>She was not getting the right seasoning.
    <br>I believe we have many chefs in the house
    <br>who can agree with me that if we put the right ingredients together,
    <br>you will be astonished by the outcome.
    <br>As such, the way and manner we process our lives determine the kind of life we will enjoy.
    <br>Now, let's come back to our message.
    <br>Are you a businessperson?
    <br>Are you a leader?
    <br>Are you a minister?
    <br>A minister once told me the strength of his ministry.
    <br>He listed the branches he has all over the world.
    <br>I began to ask myself,
    <br>"Does it mean that church is all about the number of the ministries,
    <br>branches that we have all over the world?"
    <br>Let us not forget that the apostles of old made a difference in their world.
    <br>They paid a supreme price to bring this Gospel to all of us.
    <br>If what we call our strength was their own idea of strength,
    <br>then it means they had no strength at all.
    <br>We read about many prophets of old - God's generals.
    <br>Where are their branches today?
    <br>Where are their ministries?
    <br>They never built structures but they built souls - human capacity.
    <br>Are you talking about Moses and Joshua?
    <br>Are you talking about Elijah and Elisha and the rest of them?
    <br>Until we begin to build people, only then will our ministries outlive us
    <br>for the generation yet unborn.
    <br>To be a Christian, to be a believer, to be a child of God,
    <br>we must be ready to follow the right processing.
    <br>How you become a Christian determines the kind of Christian you are.
    <br>How we have been living our lives before God
    <br>will determine how God will manifest Himself in our lives today.
    <br>It is not about make-up, dressing up, reading the Word of God without acting on it
    <br>and then coming to our midst as many will think.
    <br>No! The way and manner we have been living in the presence of God before today
    <br>will determine how God will greatly manifest Himself in our lives.
    <br>Nevertheless, it is not the works of righteousness which we have done but according to His grace.
    <br>There is another adage in my mother tongue that says, "Eni do 'mi s'iwaju a te'le tutu",
    <br>meaning, he who wets the ground ahead of him will walk on cool ground.
    <br>In other words, as you lay your bed, you lie on it.
    <br>There are many of us who are imitators of man
    <br>and that is why many people cannot live above human destruction.
    <br>There are many copiers of man, imitators of man.
    <br>Do you mean to dance?
    <br>Do you mean to smile?
    <br>I mean, do you mean to greet?
    <br>Do you mean to pray or you are praying because you see your neighbour praying?
    <br>Do you mean to say, "Amen" or are you saying "Amen"
    <br>because the man of God asked you to say, "Amen"?
    <br>Did you mean to come here today or are you here today
    <br>because you want to impress your boss, your manager?
    <br>Are you here today, maybe you were forced by your sister, your mother or your brother?
    <br>What we do seems not to be the testimony of our conscience.
    <br>That is why you see the world as it is today.
    <br>That is why our businesses, our relationships, our finances, our marriages are what they are today.
    <br>If you listen to the testimony of your conscience,
    <br>no weapon that is fashioned against you shall prosper.
    <br>You must be ready to begin to listen to the testimony of your conscience.
    <br>If you don't listen to the testimony of your conscience
    <br>by examining everything in the light of God's Word,
    <br>don't forget that people today can pretend to be good, to be truthful, to have a good reputation,
    <br>whereas their life does not testify of their confession.
    <br>But don't forget, when Christ will come to enquire of true believers,
    <br>the question will not be, "Who lives in a mansion?"
    <br>The question will not be, "Who owns the largest congregation?"
    <br>When Christ shall come to enquire of true believers,
    <br>the question will not be, "Who is a pastor, a prophet, a general overseer?"
    <br>But the question will be, "Who worships in spirit and in truth?"
    <br>For if it be not in spirit, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>How we live our lives as a Christian determines who we are in the hands of God.
    <br>Now, finally brethren:
    <br>In the Book of Psalms 37, let's take the reading from verse 6.
    <br>Psalm 37:6.
    <br>"He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday."
    <br>If you follow the right processing.
    <br>"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him;
    <br>do not fret because of him who prospers in his way,
    <br>because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass.
    <br>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath..."
    <br>Verse 11:
    <br>"...But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace."
    <br>No matter how much we master the Scriptures without true obedience
    <br>to what you read and I read, we will still be wearing spiritual diapers.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many so-called Christians today are struggling with the maturity that comes from faith
    <br>because of their ignorance in the things of the spirit.
    <br>Allow God to talk to you.
    <br>Listen to your conscience.
    <br>Examine everything you hear, you see, you read, in the light of God's Word.
    <br>By doing this you will eat the good fruit the land produces.
    <br>If you have been following the right processing and you have not yet seen the results, don't worry.
    <br>God may be taking His time to prepare you, enable you, equip you for the journey ahead.
    <br>You are about to receive the mother of all blessings.
    <br>God is preparing you for something greater than what you are seeing,
    <br>something greater than your situation.
    <br>So be patient because God will still have to mark your work.
    <br>For those who are under the influence of my voice:
    <br>This message is challenging you to seek first the Kingdom of God and all His righteousness
    <br>and every other thing - wisdom, knowledge, understanding, riches, wealth,
    <br>position and possession - will be added unto you.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
