    <br>Where is your mum?
    <br>She is in South Africa.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>Because you have a single parent.
    <br>Yes, my dad ...
    <br>You have a single parent.
    <br>Yes. That is true, man of God.
    <br>What you are facing now is you are not satisfied; it's an attack.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are not satisfied.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>This is urge.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>No man can satisfy you.
    <br>It's true, man of God.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>She's free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm delivered.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good morning, people of God.
    <br>My name is Palesa Belinda Tswaye. I come from South Africa.
    <br>Today, I am here to confirm my deliverance through the word of prophecy.
    <br>As you have seen, the man of God gave me a prophecy. He asked me where my mum is.
    <br>I said that my mum is in South Africa.
    <br>Then he said, "Because I see single parent".
    <br>I can confirm this to be true,
    <br>because even though I grew up with my father in the house,
    <br>we did not have a relationship.
    <br>So, most of the things in my life were usually taken care of by my mother.
    <br>She was the one who would be there for me.
    <br>If I needed anything or we had conversations about what I was going to do with my life, it was always my mum,
    <br>even though my dad would be busy going to work or he would be out on Sundays playing golf.
    <br>But every other day, my mum was the first person I would go to; the first point of contact was my mother.
    <br>There was no connection - I did not have a relationship with my dad at all.
    <br>So, that was an area in my life that was lacking.
    <br>And then the man of God also said, "You are not satisfied".
    <br>This is true because when you don't have that connection,
    <br>I suppose in one's life you will find other ways of getting that satisfaction.
    <br>I started smoking.
    <br>For example, on my dad's side of the family, my grandmother used to smoke,
    <br>my aunt used to smoke and my dad also used to smoke.
    <br>As I grew up, I remember when I was about 12 years old,
    <br>I found myself stealing a cigarette just to see what it was like,
    <br>and then I smoked it in the toilet at home.
    <br>When I was in high school, I stole another cigarette to experiment.
    <br>And then by 2005 it became an actual habit.
    <br>I smoked consistently and I was in and out of relationships.
    <br>There was a spirit of lust in me.
    <br>It was purely fornication, but no actual relationship where you have love and you grow in that relationship.
    <br>There was nothing like that.  So, I was in and out of different relationships.
    <br>Also, the spirit of drunkenness because I was not satisfied. I was lacking something in my life.
    <br>I found myself seeking other ways to fulfil that.
    <br>Yes, my mother was a praying woman. She would pray for me and she was there for me,
    <br>but there was something else that was lacking in me.
    <br>So, I smoked continuously
    <br>and I found myself, especially when I was under a lot of pressure with my studies
    <br>or while I was working - if there was a meeting that I needed to attend or focus on -
    <br>I found myself binge smoking.
    <br>In other words, I wouldn't just smoke one cigarette, but three, because of my anxiety.
    <br>And the only other way that I could release tension was to smoke.
    <br>It became a habit 14 years ago, from about 2005.
    <br>So, you have been smoking since 2005 - 14 years?
    <br>Yes, that is correct. Since I was studying.
    <br>I struggled with the addiction, trying to find comfort, but I couldn't find it.
    <br>I felt lost. I did not know what to do with myself or where to get a resolution.
    <br>Sometimes when I slept, a man slept with me. This was an attack.
    <br>I did not know where to find a solution.
    <br>So, this just continued.
    <br>Eventually, I found Emmanuel TV on the television and I started watching it on a continuous basis.
    <br>Every day I watched Emmanuel TV and I grew spiritually from watching Prophet TB Joshua's teachings.
    <br>I was a Christian by mouth, but my actions were not Christian.
    <br>I prayed, but I was not sincere in my heart about my prayer,
    <br>because after that I would go to clubs, drink, smoke and so on.
    <br>In April 2019 I had the opportunity to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>and I had been wanting to come here for such a long time.
    <br>I remember one day at university I saw a car with the Anointing Sticker - "Let Love Lead".
    <br>I touched it and said, "One day I will find myself at The SCOAN".
    <br>By the grace of God, I came in April 2019.
    <br>And when I came to The SCOAN, I was delivered when the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>During the deliverance I realised that my eyes were open,
    <br>because the man of God says, "You don't force yourself to believe".
    <br>So my eyes were open the whole time.
    <br>I thought maybe I would manifest into a spirit, then I would wake up and not know what had happened to me.
    <br>But my eyes were open the whole time.
    <br>He gave me the prophecy and then the ushers put me back in the line,
    <br>and then what I saw was that the man of God touched me again.
    <br>Normally people say it feels like a hammer hits you on the head;
    <br>I felt him touch me and it was like a hammer on my head.
    <br>Then I fell and screamed, and then I was delivered.
    <br>But when I was back in South Africa I watched the video on YouTube.
    <br>When they put me back in the line, the man of God did not touch me at all and I couldn't understand.
    <br>But I felt him; I saw him - my eyes were open.
    <br>The only time I closed my eyes was when I fell down, only to see that he did not touch me at all.
    <br>Then I was delivered and he said that I am free.
    <br>So, that was amazing to me.
    <br>I even told my friends. This was a testimony for me.
    <br>But how did that happen because he touched me? I felt it.
    <br>Praise God. Then I was delivered!
    <br>I just want to add where my deliverance actually started.
    <br>In 2016, I used to watch Emmanuel TV all the time and I would leave the tv on throughout the night.
    <br>One evening, while I was sleeping and Emmanuel TV was on,
    <br>I felt a man scream and shout - like electricity - and this person left my body.
    <br>I wondered, "Who left me?", because I felt him scream and leave.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning, I felt very light
    <br>and I realised that it was a demon that had left my life.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>You mean that experience and deliverance you had
    <br>motivated you to come to The SCOAN to receive total deliverance that you were seeking?
    <br>Yes, definitely. As you watch Emmanuel TV, you grow spiritually from watching the teachings.
    <br>Something in you begins to change and you desire to come here to receive your deliverance.
    <br>It really pushed me - my eagerness and desire to come to The SCOAN became stronger.
    <br>Since my deliverance in April, I no longer have any urge to smoke or to drink
    <br>and the spirit of lust is no longer there.
    <br>Previously when I wanted to stop, I would stop for a short while, but then I started again.
    <br>But now it is as though I have never smoked before.
    <br>The urge is totally gone.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully.
    <br>NO MAN CAN SATISFY YOU!!! TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>People would also say to me, "You are such a beautiful woman. Why do you smoke?",
    <br>and none of my family members knew that I smoked.
    <br>It used to hurt me so much because I thought, "Why can't I stop smoking?", and this was a burden on my life.
    <br>I was depressed because I could not overcome this urge.
    <br>But now I am a happy person. I don't have anxiety or pressure at all.
    <br>And now we can see that you are joyful, you are happy,
    <br>and your spirit is free.
    <br>Yes, my spirit is free.
    <br>Watching Emmanuel TV helped me because the message is always, "Stay in the Word; grow in the Word".
    <br>It helped me because when I am are under pressure and have anxiety, I know that I have the Word in my life.
    <br>And how is your relationship with God?
    <br>It has grown so much.
    <br>Sometimes we tend to be 'half Christian' - you are half in the world and half in the Kingdom of God,
    <br>and there is no such thing like that,
    <br>because your life gets even worse as you do the things of the world.
    <br>But now after the teachings that I have watched, I have realised that if I stay in the Word continuously and pray,
    <br>then I am at peace; I know where I belong.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together wonderfully.
    <br>NO MAN CAN SATISFY YOU!!! TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>My advice is that God manifests Himself in different ways.
    <br>Do not limit God in your life.
    <br>By just believing in Him, He will show you who He is.
    <br>Stay in the Word, pray, meditate,
    <br>use your faith bracelet if you have the grace to have it and watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>God is amazing. Then you will get to know Him better, and you will realise that He is real.
    <br>Nothing in the world is real; nothing is genuine.
    <br>Until you know God, you don't have anything real in your life.
    <br>Amen. Put your hands together.
    <br>NO MAN CAN SATISFY YOU!!! TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>We know that you have been through a lot with this problem of smoking and addiction
    <br>that the man of God prophesied about,
    <br>but tell us, did the anxiety and depression lead you to suicidal thoughts at certain points in your life?
    <br>Yes, because I questioned myself, "Why can't I get this right?",
    <br>or I had pressure to perform either at work or at school,
    <br>and if I could not find the answers or the solutions.
    <br>Because I went to different places and different churches, but I was not getting the real thing.
    <br>So I ended up, "Maybe it is better if I just end my life", because I could not find the solution.
    <br>You mean, at that time you had those thoughts?
    <br>Yes, because I was frustrated and there was no solution.
    <br>Right now, I am at peace and I feel that I know God.
    <br>When I searched in different churches and I searched everywhere,
    <br>I couldn't find the person that I could connect to that knows God,
    <br>and for me, Prophet TB Joshua's teachings have done so much more for me -
    <br>besides deliverance or miracles - but just the Word has done so much more for me
    <br>because It has grown me spiritually.
    <br>I read the Bible and now I understand God more.
    <br>He is not a figment of imagination; He is real.
    <br>And it is not something that you force.
    <br>He naturally just comes and shows His presence around you.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
