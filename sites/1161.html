    <br>In any area of your life that you find difficult to penetrate,
    <br>I want you to raise your prayer mantle, prayer sword and begin to part, divide
    <br>and make a way where there is no way.
    <br>Are you ready with me?
    <br>Every word you are going to speak at this moment – be anointed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every word that will come out of your voice, your utterances – be anointed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When your word is anointed, you can divide
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your business,
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your career,
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your finances,
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your health,
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your career,
    <br>and make a way where there is no way in your marriage.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to talk now.

    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Mrs Ionara
    <br>Brazilian Living in Tenerife
    <br>She said her name is Ionara. She is from Brazil but right now living in Spain.
    <br>I am here to give glory to God because last week, I was set free.
    <br>I was delivered from the spirit of witchcraft because my grandmother worked with evil spirits.
    <br>I want to give thanks to God because one week ago, I was delivered from evil powers
    <br>that my grandmother used to work with as a witchdoctor - evil, satanic powers.
    <br>I was delivered from this spirit of witchcraft one week ago.
    <br>I was initiated from my mother’s womb by my grandmother who was a witchdoctor
    <br>and wanted me to inherit the evil powers.
    <br>As a witchdoctor, she worked with more than 20 demonic powers.
    <br>When I was in my mother’s womb, she would touch my mother’s stomach and chant.
    <br>When I was born, I was kept for seven days and set aside where nobody could touch me.
    <br>After seven days, a ritual was performed on me to dedicate me to satan and his demons.
    <br>After that, I was kept aside for 40 days and nobody was allowed to come near me.
    <br>She said that this started when she was in her mother's womb.
    <br>Her grandmother who was a withdoctor actually dedicated her to satan.
    <br>When she was in her mother's womb, her grandmother would be touching the stomach of her mother,
    <br>chanting to the evil powers.
    <br>Later when the child was born - when she was 7 days old,
    <br>the grandmother came and did a ritual.
    <br>After that, she was kept separate in a place so that people could not see the baby
    <br>until she was 40 days old.
    <br>This was a ritual to dedicate her to satan.
    <br>As a child, I would spend the weekends at my grandmother’s house and would follow her.
    <br>Because I was a child virgin, the black magic and charms would work quicker.
    <br>The animal sacrifices would work faster if I performed the rituals.
    <br>She said that when she was very small, she went to live with her grandmother who was a witchdoctor.
    <br>She began to be an assistant to the grandmother because she was very young and a virgin.
    <br>Because of that, it was easier for her to do those charms.
    <br>That was why the evil powers would work quicker through her.
    <br>So her grandmother used her as an assistant.
    <br>My grandmother worked with black, white and red magic, african magic and gypsy magic
    <br>and many more, including evil spirits such as leviathan.
    <br>Every weekend, she would be with the grandmother.
    <br>She would be doing this witchdoctor work.
    <br>So much so that even the names of the spirit -
    <br>her grandmother worked with so many evil spirits, different kinds of magic.
    <br>For example, black magic, red magic, african magic.
    <br>All of this was the type of witchcraft her grandmother was doing and she was doing it with her.
    <br>I started to grow in this environment where every day, I would witness this witchcraft.
    <br>She would perform rituals and offer sacrifices of animals to the evil spirits.
    <br>She would also present alcohol, tobacco and fruit to the spirits at an altar in one room.
    <br>My grandmother would also go to the cemetery to practise witchcraft.
    <br>I would assist her spiritually by doing the rituals and every day, I learned more from her
    <br>and I would begin to hear and feel the spirits.
    <br>If I needed something, I would go to the altar in my grandmother’s room and listen to them.
    <br>She said that as she was growing up with her grandmother,
    <br>there was a demonic altar in the house
    <br>and there was a separate room to worship these evil spirits.
    <br>She was the one who would do the offerings, rituals
    <br>because her grandmother would always send her to do it.
    <br>So she began working with these evil spirits.
    <br>She could even recognise their voice and feel their presence.
    <br>The grandmother used to go to the cemetery and call up the spirits of dead people.
    <br>She used to work together with her grandmother in all of this.
    <br>So she learnt how to do the witchcraft, the rituals.
    <br>Her grandmother was training her day by day for her to work with these evil powers.
    <br>As I grew up, I discovered that my grandmother possessed many powers and I also possessed them.
    <br>I was like I was playing with fire as I didn’t really know what I was doing.
    <br>For example, if I kissed a boy, he would be possessed with the spirit of lust and start fornicating.
    <br>I would seduce these men with my eyes.
    <br>She said that as she continued to practise this witchcraft,
    <br>she also began doing her own charms
    <br>and also using these witchcraft powers in her own life.
    <br>For example, she was getting more powers herself.
    <br>Just an example: If she wanted to be with a man, as young as she was,
    <br>she would command the power for the man to come.
    <br>After kissing that man, the spirit of lust would enter that man
    <br>and he would fornicate with many other women.
    <br>If any of my friends hurt me or made me feel bad or uncomfortable,
    <br>when my grandmother was doing witchcraft, I would invoke the spirits to harm them
    <br>and take revenge for me.
    <br>She said that if anyone hurt, abused or insulted her - even at school or her friends -
    <br>she would call their name whilst doing these satanic rituals in order to revenge on them.
    <br>So she would want harm to come to them.
    <br>As she called their name at these charms and rituals,
    <br>it would come to pass in their life.
    <br>When I was 14 or 15 years old, I began to like one boy and I did witchcraft on him.
    <br>When I started to go out with him, I told my grandmother and she called him,
    <br>sacrificed animals and did a blood covenant to join us together.
    <br>After that, I married him and gave birth to a baby boy.
    <br>She said at the age of 14 or 15, there was a boy that she liked.
    <br>So she told the grandmother and the grandmother did some witchcraft
    <br>so that she and this boy would be joined together spiritually in a satanic covenant -
    <br>also using blood, they were joined together.
    <br>My grandmother told me that each year, I had to repeat the ritual.
    <br>Because the marriage was not based on love but on charm, it would weaken each year.
    <br>I went to live in another city and I didn’t renew the charms so the marriage got weaker.
    <br>She said that her grandmother told her that in order for this marriage to stay,
    <br>each year, she had to renew the satanic covenant
    <br>because it was a satanic covenant joining the two of them together.
    <br>But she did not renew it.
    <br>So she realised it was not real love; they were only together because of witchcraft.
    <br>Soon, she began to grow apart from that man.
    <br>And she actually went to live in another city.
    <br>because the satanic bond started losing its power and the marriage started falling apart.
    <br>I moved to Spain to live with him and my son but soon afterwards, we divorced.
    <br>He went back to Brazil, my son went to live with my mum in Brazil and I stayed in Spain.
    <br>I travelled from Galicia to Tenerife where I met my current husband.
    <br>She said that soon she moved to Spain with her husband but after that, they divorced.
    <br>She left him and her child went to live with her mother in Brazil while she stayed in Spain.
    <br>Because I did not continue with the witchcraft, the evil spirits started attacking me.
    <br>I was tormented by depression and the spirit of suicide; I tried to take my life.
    <br>I thought my life was worth nothing and everything I did good was seen as bad.
    <br>These evil spirits started attacking me in a really strong way.
    <br>She said that whilst she was living in Spain, as she was not practising this witchraft anymore,
    <br>those evil spirits began to torment her in a terrible way.
    <br>She said that she would have a spirit of suicide
    <br>where thoughts would come to her mind, telling her to kill herself.
    <br>She would have depression that these spirits would not allow her to rest
    <br>because she had been serving them for many years and now she wanted to leave,
    <br>they continued to attack and torment her so her life was worth nothing.
    <br>I had a spirit of control and manipulation and would get angry if I didn’t have my own way.
    <br>In my anger, I would hurt my husband and others because I was influenced by evil spirits.
    <br>She said that she met another man and married again.
    <br>But still the tormenting of these evil spirits continued.
    <br>She had a power of control and manipulation.
    <br>She wanted to control her husband.
    <br>She did many bad things to him because of those evil spirits that continued to torment her.
    <br>Then, my husband took me to a church for the first time but I couldn’t stay there.
    <br>I developed headaches and started to cry and wanted to leave.
    <br>She said that she had never been in a church in her life before.
    <br>When she entered one church in Spain, she was not able to stay inside.
    <br>Her head hurt, she felt like vomiting, she wanted to leave
    <br>because all the evil spirits inside of her would not allow her to be inside the church.
    <br>That is why when she tried to keep coming back to a church, she kept running away.
    <br>Then I went to another church and the pastors told me about T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>They organised a trip to visit The SCOAN where we came last week and God delivered me.
    <br>She said that finally, she went to a church in Spain where they talked to her about T.B. Joshua
    <br>and they said they were planning a visit, to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>So she decided that she must come on that visit
    <br>and that is where she came last week and received her deliverance.
    <br>Mrs Ionara
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Can you tell us exactly what happened during the mass prayer last week?
    <br>We saw on the screen how the Spirit of God took control in your life.
    <br>Can you tell us what was your experience?
    <br>Mrs Ionara
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying, I wanted to leave and run to the doors.
    <br>Before I knew it, I was at the front and was very angry and I felt like something left me.
    <br>Once it had left me with a scream, I found myself on the floor breathing heavily and calm.
    <br>She said that during the mass prayer, she felt so uncomfortable that she wanted to leave.
    <br>She even tried to leave.
    <br>Then she found out that the man of God was coming to the side where she was.
    <br>She wanted to go to the back but as she went to the back,
    <br>someone pushed her forward and that was where that evil spirit began to manifest.
    <br>She said she felt such anger inside of her.
    <br>Then, she found herself on the floor.
    <br>From there, I know that those spirits from my grandmother disappeared. I am delivered.
    <br>I feel different like a weight has come off my shoulders.
    <br>I feel light.
    <br>She said that since her deliverance last week, she feels totally free.
    <br>That it is like a huge weight has dropped from her body.
    <br>Now she feels free, happy and changed.
    <br>And she knows that something has come out of her.
    <br>Can you tell us; those nightmares and evil spirits that were tormenting you -
    <br>are you still experiencing that?
    <br>I know I am free now.
    <br>I have peace and I can sleep all night without taking tablets.
    <br>I don’t have nightmares anymore and I realise that everything I did was influenced by demons.
    <br>I thank God for setting me free from that spirit of control and manipulation that hurt my husband.
    <br>She said that ever since her deliverance, she has not had any of those nightmares.
    <br>She can sleep without taking tablets.
    <br>Before, she had to take tablets to be able to sleep.
    <br>Now she can sleep freely all night; there is no problem, no nightmare.
    <br>Those spirits are not tormenting her anymore.
    <br>Now she knows that that anger that was causing problems in her marriage has left her
    <br>and she knows she is free.
    <br>All those evil spirits that entered her right from birth are gone, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So, we give thanks to God for your wonderful deliverance.
    <br>We know the people want to learn from you.
    <br>What word of advice would you give people that think they can never be free?
    <br>How can you advise them?
    <br>Mrs Ionara
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Many people think that if you have a satanic covenant that you can never be free.
    <br>Witchcraft is a bondage because if you don’t do what they ask you to, they attack you.
    <br>I want to tell you that there is a way out – Jesus sets us free and gives us peace of heart.
    <br>It is a completely different life – a totally new feeling to the one I had before.
    <br>She said she wants to advise people that it is possible to be free.
    <br>Before, she didn't think she could ever be free from that satanic covenant.
    <br>She thought that if you have that connection with those evil spirits,
    <br>whether it is different types of magic, witchcraft, spirit of death in a cemetery
    <br>or this connection with demons, she didn't ever think she could be free.
    <br>But now she knows that yes, you can receive freedom.
    <br>That Jesus can break that covenant from satan
    <br>and Jesus can give you peace and joy.
    <br>Now she feels totally different.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>We want to thank God for your life and give glory to God for this wonderful deliverance.
    <br>Hallelujah - let's clap for Jesus!
