    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>My name is Kenneth Kimani, I come from Nairobi, Kenya.
    <br>I am 37 years old.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>At the age of 13, we had a dowry party in my village.
    <br>We used to dance when we were little and we were invited to dance at the party.
    <br>During that time, I met an old man who knew my grandfather very well.
    <br>As history would have it, my grandfather was a big drunkard who only left a legacy of drunkenness.
    <br>The man told me that if my grandfather were here, he would have tasted that liquor
    <br>so on behalf of my grandfather, he gave me a cow horn.
    <br>We use cow horns in my village to drink the traditional liquor.
    <br>On that particular day, I drank four horns of liquor which is equivalent to about four litres.
    <br>Even the old people couldn't manage to drink four, they were only drinking two horns
    <br>which was enough to get them completely drunk.
    <br>From that very day, an evil spirit entered me.
    <br>We had a lot of substances in our village such that we didn't need money to get liquor.
    <br>We used to take pineapples, we sliced them, we put them in a bucket,
    <br>we mixed it with sugar and yeast.
    <br>After seven days the concoction would contain seventy percent of alcohol.
    <br>If you take about four glasses, you are off.
    <br>My friends and I continued drinking even through primary and secondary schools.
    <br>After sitting for primary school exams, I didn't get good results.
    <br>My father decided to take me to a boarding school because in my village,
    <br>many young people didn't behave well.
    <br>I convinced him that he should not waste much money on me to go to a boarding school because
    <br>there was a lot of immorality there, not that I hated boarding schools
    <br>but because I wanted to stay in the village so that I could drink and smoke.
    <br>After joining college, we had a lot of freedom.
    <br>Because we were considered to be mature, we could go clubbing.
    <br>I would party, drink the traditional liquor as I could not always afford to drink beer.
    <br>I remember very well that during my three years in college, I drank each and every day.
    <br>There was no single day that I went for revision and I didn't do any of my practicals well.
    <br>Instead of getting credit or a distinction, I got a pass.
    <br>The spirit continued tormenting me.
    <br>Then, I went to business.
    <br>I didn't seek the job of my career.
    <br>I would get money by the evil spirit that was in me.
    <br>If I came to someone and told him that I needed some money,
    <br>before he had asked me any questions, he would have given me the money.
    <br>I would not use it to buy anything; I would use the money for drinking.
    <br>I would go through the day, drinking but you would never find me staggering.
    <br>I would stand still, no matter the amount of alcohol I had taken.
    <br>My drinking continued, together with smoking.
    <br>I started a business.
    <br>When I went to Dubai to import things, I would connect with drinking joints.
    <br>Some African people operated those joints.
    <br>I'd drink there and spend a lot of money drinking.
    <br>The evil spirit continued.
    <br>I would import a 40-foot container of mobile phone accessories.
    <br>On getting back to my country, Kenya, I would sell them.
    <br>After I had sold them, it was not like I deposited a large amount in the account,
    <br>I would go to the beer parlour.
    <br>At that time, I had a spiritual wife.
    <br>Any time that spiritual wife came to me, to make love in the dream,
    <br>I would not go to work when I woke up; rather, I would wake up early in the morning,
    <br>at 6am, go to the bar where they would open the door for me and serve me.
    <br>I would drink from Friday to Monday.
    <br>All that I wanted was to be given somewhere to change and wash my face.
    <br>The evil spirit was very strong in me.
    <br>Sir, you said that you would go to the bar on Friday and you would come back on Monday.
    <br>Do you mean you would stay in the bar from Friday, Saturday, Sunday till Monday?
    <br>Yes, without sleeping.
    <br>I would remain seated, drinking.
    <br>No matter the amount of beer I consumed, I would not blackout or stagger.
    <br>Some of my friends would tell me,
    <br>"One day, you will tell me how many people you have in you that take such kind of beer."
    <br>I would consume large amounts of alcohol.
    <br>It could not change me at all.
    <br>It continued.
    <br>All the businesses that I had crumbled because I could not save anything.
    <br>I would spend all the money that came my way, drinking.
    <br>I remember one time that I had an invitation I went to and they reserved the hard liquor
    <br>for the hard men who drank strong drinks.
    <br>But I alone took two bottles - one litre and the person who invited me
    <br>told me not to take any more, that I should reserve the rest for the guests.
    <br>The evil spirit continued tormenting me for a very long time.
    <br>In my country, by the year 2013, we were migrating from analogue to digital.
    <br>I explained my situation to one of my friends.
    <br>She told me that the only solution was deliverance.
    <br>I had tried to seek deliverance, going all over my country but it was to no avail.
    <br>Each time I would go for deliverance,
    <br>the same day, as I would come out of the church, I would end up in a beer parlour.
    <br>The problem continued.
    <br>That lady introduced me to Emmanuel TV and I started watching it.
    <br>I would come home drunk and find my wife switching on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>She told me to watch Emmanuel TV, that there was something for me there.
    <br>I started watching it.
    <br>Anytime I wanted to go out clubbing, she would tell me to sit down for a minute to watch it.
    <br>That day, I would not go to the beer parlour.
    <br>It continued until at last, someone who was coming here, brought the Morning Water to me.
    <br>I started ministering the Morning Water to myself.
    <br>I then started to reduce my drinking.
    <br>If I was going clubbing for seven days, I reduced it to five days.
    <br>I continued to also reduce the smoking.
    <br>Apart from a packet of cigarettes, I could smoke 10 cigars a day
    <br>but I continued dropping and eventually God made a way for me to be here.
    <br>I came here and had the opportunity to receive a touch from the man of God.
    <br>When I was going home, I received the Morning Water.
    <br>I had been ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>I stopped drinking and smoking.
    <br>Now, I'm a free man.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>AN ALCOHOLIC AGED 13!!! | How Drunken Addict Found FREEDOM
    <br>So sir, for a total of how many years did you have this heavy addiction to drinking alcohol and smoking?
    <br>For 24 years.
    <br>Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You said after receiving the Morning Water and prayer,
    <br>the urge for drinking and smoking stopped.
    <br>Sir, for how long now have you been alcohol and smoke free?
    <br>For about 14 months.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together one more time.
    <br>AN ALCOHOLIC AGED 13!!! | How Drunken Addict Found FREEDOM
    <br>I was fully delivered.
    <br>It happened in May this year.
    <br>I had a friend who lived in China.
    <br>He came back to my country and said that he wanted to meet me,
    <br>that there was a business he wanted to discuss with me.
    <br>I went to meet him in a beer parlour.
    <br>He asked for two bottles of beer.
    <br>I told him that I no longer drank and asked for a soft drink.
    <br>Within 10 minutes, I lost my sight - I could not see anything.
    <br>I told him that I could not see him, that I couldn't see anything.
    <br>I asked him to hold me and lead me to the way out of the beer parlour.
    <br>Immediately I got out, I regained my sight!
    <br>AN ALCOHOLIC AGED 13!!! | How Drunken Addict Found FREEDOM
    <br>The advice that I want to give the viewers and all those in church is that Jesus is above everything.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is a mighty man of God.
    <br>Power surpasses power, we have been in different levels of anointing,
    <br>but anointing in this place is the anointing from God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
