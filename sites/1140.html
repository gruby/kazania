    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On the 7th of January, 2018 the first Sunday of the year,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message concerning what would unfold
    <br>starting from the month of July.
    <br>These were his words...
    <br>This year, things will begin to unfold, starting from July.
    <br>My dear brothers, you have to be ready for battle.
    <br>It's our sin, our unfaithfulness.
    <br>It's only God that can save one from it.
    <br>That is why you have to seek the face of God more than ever.
