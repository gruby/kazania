  <p>    
    <br>Are you in an attitude of prayer?
    <br>Like I have said:
    <br>Faith releases healing power.
    <br>Faith releases blessing.
    <br>Faith is like a vacuum that draws anointing from God.
    <br>And you are building faith.
    <br>You are like a ball that is not well pumped.
    <br>But the more you say, "Take more of me, give me more of You" you are pumping the ball.
    <br>You see the ball becoming big.
    <br>You are the ball.
    <br>So if you stop, you stop pumping and if you continue, the ball will continue to grow big.
    <br>The air that enters is that faith; the words you are saying, "Take more of me, give me more of You",
    <br>it is so strong - spirit prayer.
    <br>When you get that ball up to a standard, to the level you can play with it -
    <br>you begin to eat with Jesus, see visions, dream dreams.
    <br>Your heart will begin to talk to you.
    <br>You don't need to sleep to see a vision; it is our heart that talks to us.
    <br>You will be moving, your heart will be saying, "Don't go there, go back."
    <br>"Who is talking to me?" - it is your heart.
    <br>Pumped by faith - get it working.
    <br>See with your heart, not with your eyes.
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>Every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God, be broken, in Jesus' name!
    <br>We want to fight this barrier.
    <br>Whatever barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>What could be the barrier?
    <br>It could be offence you are holding against your neighbour.
    <br>You say, "Over my dead body - I will not forgive."
    <br>Are you holding offence, grudges, hatred, bitterness or pain of the past?
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I want you to stretch your hand and begin to remove whatever satan might have used to connect you.
    <br>He uses pain of the past to connect us to himself.
    <br>He uses bitterness to connect us to himself.
    <br>He uses pain of the past to connect us to himself.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself, begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I want to believe you are with a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that joins to the Spirit of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Right now, whatever strange spirit is around, within, outside -
    <br>we want to put them where they belong.
    <br>We want to tell them where they should go.
    <br>Right now, every familiar spirit,
    <br>you, familiar spirit,
    <br>every familiar spirit...
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>Whatever spirit - within or outside that torments your business, life, that stands in your way -
    <br>be cursed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, every knee...
    <br>Every enemy shall surrender, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every enemy shall surrender.
    <br>I say to your enemy - surrender!
    <br>Surrender!
    <br>Enemy of progress,
    <br>enemy of your health, finances, business, career, future, destiny, family, marriage, country...
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances

    <br>All enemies shall surrender hearing the name 'Jesus'.
    <br>Why should yours not surrender?
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>All enemies shall surrender, including yours.
    <br>Put them where they belong.
    <br>Command them.

    <br>I destroy her.
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>I am the giant man.
    <br>I want to kill her.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>I caused her barrenness.
    <br>I want to destroy her.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>We are soldiers
    <br>Soldiers of the Lord
    <br>In the name of Jesus
    <br>We shall conquer
    <br>We are soldiers
    <br>Soldiers of the Lord
    <br>In the name of Jesus
    <br>We shall conquer
    <br>We are soldiers
    <br>Soldiers of the Lord
    <br>In the name of Jesus
    <br>We have conquered
    <br>We are soldiers
    <br>Soldiers of the Lord
    <br>In the name of Jesus
    <br>We have conquered
    <br>We are soldiers
    <br>Soldiers of the Lord
    <br>In the name of Jesus
    <br>We have conquered
    <br>Give thanks to God and believe it is done.
    <br>I say it is done!
    <br>It is done!
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>I pray that the Lord exposes your weakness and delivers you.
    <br>Every weakness - be exposed and delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>You have been delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You have been set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Do you know what it means when an anointed man of God says, "you have been set free"?
    <br>Now, in this case, the choice is yours.
    <br>You can choose to say, "I have been set free".
    <br>You can choose to say, "No, I am not yet set free."
    <br>You have been set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you walking in liberty!
    <br>I can see you walking in freedom!
    <br>I can see you walking in breakthrough!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Let the people of God say, "Amen!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>The question: Do you know yourself?
    <br>Do you know you have been delivered?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Do you know yourself?
    <br>Do you know you have been delivered?"
    <br>You believe that?
    <br>Let me see your excitement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am happy that you have been set free.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I am happy for your life.
