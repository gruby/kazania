  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>West, South, North...
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We want to start our lesson from the Book of Mark because of the word "believe".
    <br>You will understand it better in this text.
    <br>In that Book Mark 16:17.
    <br>“And these signs will follow those who believe:
    <br>In My name they will cast out demons.”
    <br>The word "believing" is what we want to talk about now.
    <br>If you believe, those signs shall follow you,
    <br>shall be yours.
    <br>We take our title:
    <br>ACTING ON THE WORD
    <br>That is just the word "believing".
    <br>Believing demands action, creates action.
    <br>It requires performance.
    <br>You say, "Yes, I'm a good player".
    <br>"You are a good player? Let's go to the field. Show yourself - you are a good player."
    <br>"A good player" - it is not a word of mouth; you go to the field and show yourself.
    <br>Perform!
    <br>God’s Word reflects His character.
    <br>When you say "belief", you talk of action.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord" - show it.
    <br>"Deliverer" - show it.
    <br>"I'm a child of God" - show it.
    <br>Mental assent admits, admires but does not act.
    <br>Acting on the Word is letting Christ act through you
    <br>because Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>He does nothing without His Word.
    <br>Through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Letting the Word have right of way in your life
    <br>is letting Christ have right of way because Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>Letting the Word have right of way in your life
    <br>is letting Christ have right of way.
    <br>It is the Word dwelling in you
    <br>which is equivalent to Christ’s personally being in you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>ACTING ON THE WORD
    <br>It is the Word dwelling in you
    <br>which is equivalent to Christ’s personally being in you.
    <br>Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of James 1:22.
    <br>“Be doers of the word, and not hearers only,
    <br>deceiving yourselves.
    <br>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer,
    <br>he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;
    <br>for he observes himself, goes away and immediately forgets
    <br>what kind of man he was.”
    <br>Acting on the Word then gives God an opportunity
    <br>to heal, bless, save, deliver, touch you.
    <br>Giving the Word its place is giving Christ His position of Lordship.
    <br>The Word dominating you is the Lordship of Christ in you.
    <br>The problem of believing is made simple when we know that
    <br>it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>The problem of believing - because that is the problem we Christians are having today -
    <br>processing.
    <br>You cannot be greater than your processing.
    <br>The way I dressed in the room is the way I look now.
    <br>The way I combed my hair is the way I look now.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You cannot be greater than your processing.
    <br>Believing is like ingredients.
    <br>When you are making a soup, you put ingredients - processing.
    <br>When one is missing, you miss all.
    <br>You want to say 1 + 1 + 1 is equal to 3,
    <br>but you now say 1 + 1 + 1 is 4 - something is wrong somewhere.
    <br>The problem of believing is made simple when we know that
    <br>it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>"Love your neighbour as yourself" - that is God!
    <br>I'm going to act on that, I'm going to love my neighbour as myself.
    <br>Humble, for God's sake.
    <br>My humility this time is not for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>Humility for God's sake.
    <br>I'm going to be faithful for God's sake.
    <br>The wise man is the doer of the Word.
    <br>The other hears but does not act upon it.
    <br>He is a sense knowledge hearer.
    <br>He is a mental assenter
    <br>because he responds to reason instead of the Word of God.
    <br>He is a mental assenter.
    <br>He responds to reason instead of the Word of God.
    <br>Their faculty is the one that dictates their direction.
    <br>When they are sick, they pray for healing.
    <br>When they are poor, they pray for blessing.
    <br>When they are blessed, they say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Their situation dictates the direction of their prayer.
    <br>If things are alright, you see them dancing in the church, "Thank You, Jesus...".
    <br>When satan knows that your situation is the one that dictates the direction of your prayer,
    <br>he will not allow you to be free.
    <br>You will continue to complain...
    <br>He will not want you to say, "Thank You, Jesus" for one day.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>if satan knows that your situation is the one that dictates the direction of your prayer,
    <br>he will not allow you to say, “Thank You, Jesus.”
    <br>How To ACTUALLY DO What The BIBLE Says!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The Word of God says, "Let the weak say, 'I'm strong', 'Let the sick say, 'I'm healed'".
    <br>You would never hear them say...
    <br>They would say, "I'm sick, how can I say 'I'm healed', when they have not prayed for me?"
    <br>Let the poor say, 'I'm blessed' - "I have not gone home to do business to get money, they say I'm blessed" - no.
    <br>He responds to reason instead of what?
    <br>The Word of God.
    <br>By His stripes we are  healed.
    <br>If he has faith in anything, it is in man, what man has done -
    <br>science, works, organization, etc.
    <br>These are the things he has faith in.
    <br>Science is all about facts, not truth, because things can change, but the Word of God is same truth.
    <br>If he has faith in anything, it is in man.
    <br>"Look at that company - wonderful, I want to be like that man."
    <br>How can you be like a man?
    <br>No, you can't be like that man - that is imitation.
    <br>We know the Word, everyone knows the Word.
    <br>"What is the Word of God?"
    <br>"This is the Word of God."
    <br>The Word we are talking about is on the lips of the believer,
    <br>not in the book, not on the written pages.
    <br>We may be familiar with the original Greek or Hebrew,
    <br>we may know the history of the Word
    <br>but that is all baseless, wasted energy, if you do not act on the Word,
    <br>if you do not live the Word and practice it.
    <br>If we do not live the Word and practice it, we cannot bring Jesus on the scene.
    <br>Prayer is a reality.
    <br>We are not talking into the air.
    <br>Prayer is a reality.
    <br>When you say, "Be healed, be delivered",
    <br>here, the name Jesus is always honoured.
    <br>If you act on the Word, the name Jesus is always honoured.
    <br>What a grave danger of deluding ourselves, deceiving ourselves.
    <br>What a danger if there is no corresponding action.
    <br>If we say, “In the name of Jesus”, without corresponding action,
    <br>it will be idle, meaningless, and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>It is the doer of the Word that receives things from God.
    <br>Idle words may entertain men; they do not reach God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>It is the doer of the Word that receives things from God.
    <br>Idle words may entertain men; they do not reach God.
    <br>How To ACTUALLY DO What The BIBLE Says!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let's open the Book of Ephesians 3:20.
    <br>“Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all
    <br>that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.”
    <br>There is the word that controls the tense there.
    <br>Let's read together.
    <br>“Now to Him who is able to do…”
    <br>Underline the word "do".
    <br>If you remove "do", the whole word is useless.
    <br>How can I do it?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>It is going to be according to the ability of God that is at work in us.
    <br>What is the ability?
    <br>You are here today because you are energized by Christ.
    <br>You walk freely, you talk freely, you sit down freely, you listen to me freely.
    <br>There are many people on the sickbed; they want to be here but they are not energized.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>I am here today because I am energized by Christ Jesus.
    <br>How To ACTUALLY DO What The BIBLE Says!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>It is going to be according to the ability of God that is at work within us.
    <br>You say, "Which ability of God that is at work within me?
    <br>I don't have any ability because I cannot heal.
    <br>I don't have any ability because I cannot see vision".
    <br>No!
    <br>This is the ability of God.
    <br>1 Corinthians 1:30
    <br>“But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us the wisdom from God -
    <br>and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.”
    <br>You have Him as your wisdom.
    <br>He is your redemption as well,
    <br>a redemption for your weakness and your failure,
    <br>lack of ability and ignorance.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>I have Him as my wisdom.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>He is my redemption as well -
    <br>a redemption for my weakness, failure, lack of ability and ignorance.
    <br>When you are weak, then you are strong.
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Here is weakness, there is a strength always with me, before me, after me, behind me.
    <br>I have Him as my wisdom and strength.
    <br>He is my redemption.
    <br>A redemption for my weakness, failure, lack of ability and ignorance.
    <br>Let me come to the end of this message.
    <br>Let's look at the Book of Colossians 1:9.
    <br>We have exact knowledge, complete knowledge.
    <br>That knowledge is in the Word.
    <br>There is so much demanding, "I'm looking for wealth, possession."
    <br>Everything you are looking for is in the Word.
    <br>We have exact knowledge, complete knowledge, perfect knowledge.
    <br>That knowledge is in the Word.
    <br>What you are demanding for is in the Word.
    <br>We illumine by the Spirit.
    <br>We can only get it when the Word gets into our blood and gains supremacy over us.
    <br>It becomes a Spirit; the Spirit speaks.
    <br>In conclusion:
    <br>We have exact knowledge, wisdom, blessing, breakthrough - just name them.
    <br>What you are looking for, what you are searching for is in the Word.
    <br>How To ACTUALLY DO What The BIBLE Says!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>That money you are looking for is in the Word.
    <br>That possession you are looking for is in the Word.
    <br>Authority you are looking for is in the Word.
    <br>In the Word is prestige, fame, popularity, good health, healing, breakthrough you are looking for.
    <br>It is in the Word.
    <br>You want to become the president of a nation, senator?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>It is in the Word.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>How To ACTUALLY DO What The BIBLE Says!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>By anointing Jesus breaks the yoke
    <br>By the Holy Ghost and power
    <br>Just as the prophet said
    <br>This is the day of the latter reign
    <br>God is moving in His power again
    <br>By anointing Jesus breaks the yoke
    <br>It’s not by power
    <br>It’s not by might
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>It’s not by power
    <br>It’s not by might
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>This mountain has been removed
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>This mountain has been removed
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
