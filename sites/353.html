  <p>    
    <br>The evil spirit in this man was among the many who could not escape the anointing of God.
    <br>There is a spiritual battle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness.
    <br>As Wise Man Daniel battles the spiritual entities causing crises in this man's life,
    <br>the evil spirits are in trouble and heading towards extinction.
    <br>Let us watch to see how the encounter between Wise Man Daniel and the evil spirit ended.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ! All over your body.
    <br>All over your body, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your face, your legs - fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Anywhere you wicked demon are located -
    <br>fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire! All over your body, you demon!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ! Right now, speak out!
    <br>Allow me to go.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Do you want to know me?
    <br>Jesus wants to know you. Speak out!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Let me speak.
    <br>Speak! You have no choice; you must.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>The spirit of lust.
    <br>How many of you are in this body?
    <br>Three.
    <br>Who is the second person?
    <br>Spiritual wife.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>The last person?
    <br>Spirit of anger.
    <br>Ok. As spirit of anger, how do you operate in this body?
    <br>I make him angry.
    <br>When he is angry, what happens in the house?
    <br>He fights and tries to beat the wife.
    <br>Does he slap or kick?
    <br>He slaps and kicks.
    <br>How do you feel each time he is slapping and kicking the wife?
    <br>How do you feel, you demon?
    <br>I feel good.
    <br>You feel good?
    <br>Yes, very good.
    <br>How has this spirit of anger affected the marriage?
    <br>Which marriage?
    <br>His marriage.
    <br>He doesn't have any marriage.
    <br>No marriage.
    <br>No marriage?
    <br>No.
    <br>We don't have anything to talk about marriage.
    <br>Ok. As spiritual wife, what have you done to his career as a man?
    <br>I destroyed everything.
    <br>This guy - do you know this guy?
    <br>You don't know him.
    <br>He is a very great guy.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>I destroyed everything - nothing to write about.
    <br>What are the things he had that you have destroyed?
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Uncountable.
    <br>This man you see here was worth millions but I made him suffer
    <br>and lose every business he put his money into.
    <br>I destroyed those businesses.
    <br>What kind of business was he doing that you destroyed?
    <br>Importation, of course.
    <br>Ehe.
    <br>How did you destroy those things?
    <br>Whenever he imports it, one story or the other.
    <br>I am the one that did it.
    <br>Is it that you seize his containers or how do you go about it?
    <br>Yes, I seized it - a lot of them.
    <br>Like how many did you succeed in getting seized?
    <br>Millions worth of naira.
    <br>He is a great man. He is a rich man.
    <br>You don't know him. He had been abroad for many years.
    <br>For more than 13 years, he made money.
    <br>But I made sure I wiped all the money.
    <br>How do you operate in him as spirit of lust?
    <br>I seduce women.
    <br>How do you use him to go about that?
    <br>When they look at his eyes?
    <br>With my eyes, of course.
    <br>What happens? Explain.
    <br>They will lose control, of course.
    <br>When they lose control, what happens to them?
    <br>They will be following me everywhere.
    <br>How do you use your eyes to move them?
    <br>Can't you see it?
    <br>In my eyes.
    <br>Do you smile or you just stand there?
    <br>Charming - charming eyes.
    <br>That is how you do it?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Those who are married among them, what happens to their marriage?
    <br>I don't have anything to do with married women.
    <br>Ok. Those who are not married, what happens to them?
    <br>They follow me everywhere.
    <br>When they follow you, what happens to them? Will they have a settled home?
    <br>No.
    <br>Ok. What happens to them that makes them not to have a settled home?
    <br>They will be roaming about.
    <br>They will not even see any man who will marry them.
    <br>How many have you succeeded in destroying like this?
    <br>Many; I can't count them.
    <br>You can't count them?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. Who is this woman to you?
    <br>Which woman?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>What about this gentleman here?
    <br>I am alone.
    <br>How are you, ma?
    <br>I am fine, sir.
    <br>Who is he to you?
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>Ok. What about you?
    <br>We are from the same place and we have been together in Switzerland for many years.
    <br>As a wife, what can you say about your husband?
    <br>He has the spirit of lust, as he said.
    <br>Even now, he has a girl who used to call and insult me.
    <br>She would tell me all sort of things, that my husband will marry her
    <br>and drive me out of the house.
    <br>His family accused me that I am the one who is scattering his business.
    <br>In the marriage, there is no peace.
    <br>They told him to throw me out of the house, that I am a witch
    <br>and the one scattering his family.
    <br>So, I decided to come here so that God would expose whoever was doing this.
    <br>Ok. Your in-laws always accuse you that you are the one causing trouble?
    <br>Yes, his family accused me that I was the one who was scattering his business,
    <br>that he should throw me out.
    <br>Even the business he opened for me, he seized it.
    <br>He beats me every day in the house. He has the spirit of anger
    <br>and he has the spirit of unforgiveness. He doesn't forgive easily.
    <br>So, you demon, it is time you vacate this body!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body, you demon, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You have no choice.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Rise up, you are free.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Rise up, you are free.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Stand up, sir.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>Who is this woman?
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>Ok. What about the gentleman here?
    <br>He is my brother.
    <br>He is my lovely brother.
    <br>So, ma, listen. The reason why I asked him this question is for you to know that the past is over.
    <br>The confession you heard was not from your husband.
    <br>This is a different person.
    <br>The person who spoke was not your husband but a demon
    <br>and that demon is out.
    <br>So, for no reason should you remind him of what happened today
    <br>so that you will not be tempted, okay?
    <br>Okay. Thank You, Jesus, for saving my family and marriage!
    <br>Give thanks to God. You are free.
    <br>Stand up, sir!
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, God of T.B. Joshua, for saving my marriage and my home!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Okpalaeze Chidi.
    <br>I am originally from Enugu State
    <br>but I have stayed in Switzerland for many years.
    <br>The woman beside me is my lovely wife, Stella Okpalaeze.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life.
    <br>What God has done in my life - I don't know how to state it.
    <br>My testimony goes like this.
    <br>I have been abroad for 14 to 15 years now.
    <br>I kept on having this problem of setback in business -
    <br>any business I was involved in kept on crumbling.
    <br>I was not moving forward the way I was supposed to
    <br>because I trust myself in anything I am doing.
    <br>I know I am capable to handle it.
    <br>It kept on happening.
    <br>Not until I came back to Nigeria.
    <br>I have been to many churches.
    <br>Ok, brother.
    <br>Before going ahead, you mentioned that, first of all,
    <br>this problem manifested in the form of business collapsing.
    <br>But, apart from that, what experiences did you begin to have in your dreams
    <br>that made you realise that something was happening?
    <br>A woman used to visit me in my dreams.
    <br>Sometimes, when I woke up, I would see my clothes to be wet.
    <br>Many times when I would be sleeping with my wife,
    <br>she would wake me up and ask me, "What are you doing?
    <br>You are doing as if you are making love to somebody".
    <br>If she woke me up, I would continue to sleep again.
    <br>But it kept on happening to me every time.
    <br>I tried my best to hide it from everybody.
    <br>But every time I was sleeping, the woman would come in my dreams to make love to me.
    <br>Anytime this thing happened, any business I put my hand on - nothing would work out.
    <br>The business started to turn back.
    <br>I am into importation.
    <br>I have travelled to many countries.
    <br>I import containers but one problem or the other -
    <br>either they would seize it or the people I did the business with would dupe me.
    <br>I sponsored many things but at the end, none of them worked out.
    <br>I even tried to use my wife to go on with the business.
    <br>I invested millions of naira in the business I opened for her.
    <br>But at the end of it, nothing came out of it. The same thing happened.
    <br>I even realised that the thing was just like a virus.
    <br>Anybody I did something with, the same thing would happen.
    <br>I thought it was something I could handle myself.
    <br>I knew that something was wrong somewhere
    <br>but I could not exactly figure it out.
    <br>I thought I knew what to do.
    <br>The best friend I had was alcohol.
    <br>I drank in the morning, afternoon and night.
    <br>I didn't have a brand.
    <br>I involved myself in many things -
    <br>womanising, clubbing - just to try to make myself happy.
    <br>I didn't know that the way I was going was the wrong way.
    <br>I couldn't sleep.
    <br>I took all kinds of tablets to make me sleep but I couldn't sleep.
    <br>I would go to bed with acute headache,
    <br>and I would wake up with acute headache.
    <br>It got to a point where my mother even started asking me whether I was smoking Indian hemp
    <br>because my eyes were always red.
    <br>You know that when somebody would go to bed and would not sleep,
    <br>the same way you went to bed would be the same way you would wake up.
    <br>What would happen that you would find women easily being attracted to you?
    <br>You know that it is a man that is in the position to toast a woman
    <br>but there was something in me, in my eyes.
    <br>Wherever I came in or any woman I came across,
    <br>if I looked at her, she would be following me, going after me.
    <br>They didn't need my money. They just wanted me to sleep with them.
    <br>For example, I was at a junction one day, my car had broken down.
    <br>A girl looked at me and greeted me.
    <br>Immediately I drove out, the girl took a bike and went after me.
    <br>Not until I found myself at a joint where I sat down to drink something,
    <br>the girl came in, sat down and greeted me.
    <br>I now said to myself, "Is this not the same girl I saw at the junction?"
    <br>She began to toast me.
    <br>You can imagine where a woman would be proud to talk to a man,
    <br>that she wanted to be with you.
    <br>I noticed this thing many times.
    <br>It happened on several occasions.
    <br>I didn't know what to do about it.
    <br>Now, with all of this life that you were living,
    <br>tell us - what was the effect of this on your marriage and what was happening in your marital life?
    <br>I didn't see my wife as a woman.
    <br>I didn't have affection for her.
    <br>I always had my happiness when I was outside.
    <br>I enjoyed myself outside.
    <br>I came back late.
    <br>I lived the kind of life I wanted to live.
    <br>I had stopped eating my wife's food for months.
    <br>I would eat outside.
    <br>Whenever I was home, any time she wanted to ask me a question,
    <br>I would slap her. I would beat her.
    <br>I even told her, "Can't you read the handwriting on the wall?
    <br>Is it not better for you to pack your things and move out from this house?"
    <br>I have thrown my wife out of the house not less than three or four times.
    <br>Many pastors and family members came in to settle our problems
    <br>but nobody could settle the problem.
    <br>We have been together for more than 11 years
    <br>and we are looking for the fruit of the womb.
    <br>When she was pregnant, I went to the extent of beating her, misbehaving as I was always doing,
    <br>to the extent that she lost the pregnancy of six months.
    <br>She delivered the baby when it was not okay to deliver the baby - at six months.
    <br>Because you had beaten her up - it was the force that caused her to deliver?
    <br>Yes, when all these things came up, I would break things in my house -
    <br>the centre table, the television.
    <br>I would even use my standing fan to hit her.
    <br>I did a lot of things.
    <br>When I realised myself, I would feel pity for her.
    <br>But once that spirit came up, I wouldn't even see her like my wife.
    <br>I didn't even realise that she is a beautiful woman like this.
    <br>I was seeing these women outside as the best.
    <br>I felt happy when I was not in my home.
    <br>I always felt bad when I was coming home.
    <br>So, if I was coming home, what she just needed to do,
    <br>was to go and sleep in her own room because I had told her,
    <br>"I don't want to be sleeping with you. You have to stay in your own room
    <br>and I have to stay in my own room".
    <br>Once I was in, the best thing that happened to her, was that I went inside my room.
    <br>I would lock it because if I didn't lock it, she would come and start to hit at my door,
    <br>that I should open my room for her so that she would sleep with me.
    <br>I didn't want her to sleep with me because I had already been satisfied outside.
    <br>If I came back and she would be asking me questions, I would start beating her.
    <br>Now, brother, we just want to understand.
    <br>People who looked at you at the outside - did they ever know that
    <br>such thing was happening in your home or you were experiencing such terrible problems?
    <br>Everybody that knew me - I put on good clothes, I drive big cars -
    <br>they didn't know that I was dying inside.
    <br>I didn't have a solution.
    <br>I knew that something was seriously wrong.
    <br>I went to many churches but there was no solution to my problem.
    <br>Did it ever come to a point where you felt like giving up on life?
    <br>Not once.
    <br>I even told my wife many times - she is here, she is my live witness -
    <br>that I would put an end to this.
    <br>I thought of committing suicide many times.
    <br>Even one time when I was driving with her, I got annoyed and told her,
    <br>"You see we are on top of the bridge. Do you know that I can just drive this thing directly to that end?
    <br>Everybody will just die. All these problems will end because I am tired of all these problems".
    <br>She wouldn't even talk. It was even better for her not to utter a word
    <br>because if she would have said something good or bad, it would have worsened the situation.
    <br>I didn't like her to advise me or tell me what to do.
    <br>I didn't regard her words.
    <br>I thought about commmitting suicide many times.
    <br>I kept on wondering what I was going to do.
    <br>My beloved mother introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I installed it in my room.
    <br>Any time I was home, I would put on the channel
    <br>but I kept on pretending to my mother because she always called me and asked me,
    <br>"I hope you are watching Emmanuel TV". I replied, "Yes".
    <br>But when I looked at it, everything looked fake to me.
    <br>I would just pretend and tell her, "Yes, I am watching it".
    <br>But I didn't believe - I just saw it as an arrangement.
    <br>I said to myself, "How can this be possible?"
    <br>It kept on going like that.
    <br>So you mean when watching Emmanuel TV, if you saw a deliverance and someone was demon-possessed -
    <br>what would you say, what was your reaction?
    <br>I always said that this was a planned something.
    <br>They might have arranged it with the person.
    <br>I didn't believe all these things because I was a Thomas, I didn't believe in anything.
    <br>I believed in seeing something before believing in it.
    <br>I kept on watching Emmanuel TV when I felt like it.
    <br>I saw what happened to other families.
    <br>Whenever I talked with my mother, she always continued telling me, "Keep on watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>That what is happening to other people will surely happen to you".
    <br>Everybody knew that I had a big problem but they didn't know the solution to that.
    <br>I was a very angry person.
    <br>When I got angry, I could destroy things. I would break things.
    <br>I would even fight my younger brother with a bottle.
    <br>When I was angry like that, even my wife would run into her own room and lock it
    <br>because in my flat, I would break the doors - not less than ten times.
    <br>Ok, brother. Now we understood how severely these evil spirits affected your life.
    <br>You said your mother introduced you to Emmanuel TV and insisted
    <br>that you kept on watching and came down to The SCOAN.
    <br>What actually finally led you to be here at The SCOAN?
    <br>Because people would see me, "Ah, this man is a big man. He has big cars. He puts on good clothes"
    <br>but they didn't know what I was passing through.
    <br>So I began to give it a second thought.
    <br>I said to myself, "Let me go there".
    <br>When I was coming to The SCOAN, I was just coming here, I didn't believe.
    <br>I said to myself, "Let me come and see what is happening here".
    <br>The very first day I came, when the wise men were laying hands on people,
    <br>when they started coming towards my direction, I saw a different thing.
    <br>The fire was coming towards my direction.
    <br>I could not resist it.
    <br>When the man of God layed his hand on me, I fell down.
    <br>The ushers told me to stand here because he was coming back.
    <br>I managed to collect my Bible, ran and escaped from the church.
    <br>So the first day you came here, you actually ran out of the church?
    <br>Yes, I escaped because what I saw that day was a different thing - I could not withstand it.
    <br>I wanted to leave from here without my wife but she knew me very well.
    <br>Once I got angry, she knew that I would leave her.
    <br>She came after me and I did not even talk to her.
    <br>We drove for more than an hour and got home.
    <br>I then began to realise, "What is happening to me?"
    <br>My wife put the TV on - to the same place where we were coming from.
    <br>We were watching the same channel.
    <br>She would not utter any word because she knew very well
    <br>that if she said anything, I might even break her head.
    <br>I sat down and began to ponder, "What is going on in my life?"
    <br>After that, the next week I prepared and said, "I am going back to The SCOAN".
    <br>I came here again.
    <br>It happened that when the wise men started laying hands,
    <br>Wise Man Daniel came towards my direction, the same thing happened.
    <br>But, Children of God, I have to tell you something.
    <br>You might be coming here but the day must surely be your day.
    <br>That day, everything that is troubling you will come to an end.
    <br>Everybody has his own day.
    <br>That very day, that very blessed day, I tried to escape
    <br>but it was like all the ushers - everybody - prepared and were waiting for me.
    <br>Mr Okpalaeze Chidi
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So they didn't give me any gap.
    <br>When Wise Man Daniel was praying for people, immediately he came towards my direction,
    <br>the fire - I couldn't even look at his eyes.
    <br>When he came directly to me, the fire was so much, I didn't know where I was again.
    <br>I found myself on the floor and woke up.
    <br>I knew that I was saying something but I couldn't control it.
    <br>I didn't know what was coming out from my mouth.
    <br>After my deliverance, my wife told me everything that happened.
    <br>When I woke up, I saw myself in the middle of the church.
    <br>You know, children of God, it is here that I found out that God exists
    <br>because what happened to me that very day...
    <br>Mr Okpalaeze Chidi
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>...I had never experienced that before.
    <br>The fire was coming from every angle.
    <br>But when I just woke up on the ground, I realised myself.
    <br>I feel like a heavy block, bag of cement, moved out of my body.
    <br>I feel light.
    <br>I feel ashamed of myself - before I was not ashamed of anything.
    <br>I started to feel ashamed.
    <br>I feel very light.
    <br>I recognise my wife. I see her now as very beautiful.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mr Okpalaeze Chidi
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>What are the changes you have immediately experienced after this experience?
    <br>Children of God, after my deliverance, I was singing with my wife when we were driving home.
    <br>We now eat together, pray together and sleep in the same room - not even the same room but the same bed.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I keep on asking her to forgive me.
    <br>I looked at her hair and the following day I gave her money and said,
    <br>that this hairstyle was not good. She should go and get a different one.
    <br>Mr Okpalaeze Chidi
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I sleep like a newborn baby.
    <br>I wake up soundly.
    <br>Before, if I wanted to sleep, I would go to my bar and drink like two glasses of a hot drink
    <br>or anything that was there to make me to sleep.
    <br>But this time around, I don't take any pills or alcohol.
    <br>I sleep like a baby. I wake up 100% fit.
    <br>I feel like jumping around.
    <br>I know that a lot of people out there are the same Thomas like I was.
    <br>I believed that seeing is believing.
    <br>You need to see and believe.
    <br>If the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua can do this for me, He will do it for everybody.
    <br>Even for you Thomas that is out there.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>My business, what I ordered now - just one week after my deliverance -
    <br>the goods came in successfully and we did the promo.
    <br>The business is booming; it is going on now.
    <br>So, I have a lot of changes.
    <br>I have a good relationship with people,
    <br>I have a good relationship with my wife -
    <br>we discuss everything together what I want to do.
    <br>And you are no longer going outside to meet other women?
    <br>I don't even have the urge to go outside.
    <br>She would even be the one to tell me,
    <br>"Why can't you go out, drive around and come back?"
    <br>I would reply, "No, I am tired".
    <br>I don't have the urge to go around.
    <br>As from that day, I don't see alcohol as anything.
    <br>Women will see me...
    <br>On Valentine's Day, she told me, "We passed so many girls and nobody looked at you".
    <br>Before, she would have a problem with women, every time we would be out together.
    <br>A lot of changes.
    <br>Those things that I was experiencing then, I now no longer experience them.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is the deliverance that is happening here every day at The SCOAN
    <br>and I know many of us here today are ready and expecting to receive their own deliverance.
    <br>We know that as you receive your deliverance, you too will stands in the midst of God's people
    <br>to share your testimony.
    <br>So, finally, sir, what is your advice to viewers around the world and those present here?
    <br>Especially those who are sceptical, cynical about what is happening here
    <br>as you once were - what is your message to them?
    <br>First of all, I want to ask God to forgive me
    <br>and I want to ask our Daddy in the Lord, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua for forgiveness,
    <br>because I am one of those people that said one bad thing or the other against this place.
    <br>My advice to the whole world - the viewers and especially the Thomases like I once was:
    <br>You have to believe in God and try and come to The SCOAN for your deliverance.
    <br>You might be there, driving big cars, and the things that I experienced in my life are happening to you.
    <br>You need to come down here and have your deliverance
    <br>because everybody that is having this kind of problem needs deliverance.
    <br>Once you have been delivered, you will see a lot of changes.
    <br>You will see a difference in your life.
    <br>And I believe that that God that did it for me will also do it for everyone of you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We thank God for your life, sir.
    <br>We just want to hear a quick word from your wife -
    <br>to hear from her, her own side of the testimony.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome.
    <br>Just introduce yourself to us and tell us what you can say about your husband's wonderful deliverance.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Stella Okpalaeze.
    <br>The man beside me is my lovely husband.
    <br>He has already said everything.
    <br>But I also have things to say.
    <br>When this was going on, he hated me with passion.
    <br>He didn't even wanted to see me. Even though I cooked, he said the food was not good.
    <br>Anything I did in the house was not good.
    <br>He beat me the way he wanted to.
    <br>Sometimes I would be begging him: If I did anything wrong, he should please forgive me.
    <br>He replied, "You have not done anything to me but I don't want you see you".
    <br>He told me many times to leave the house but I refused to leave.
    <br>The family accused me, telling him that I was the cause of all this. He should drive me away.
    <br>We were still there.
    <br>Last January, when the thing was severe, each time I watched Emmanuel TV, I kept on praying.
    <br>I used to see many things happening here. Even broken homes were brought back together.
    <br>I knew it would happen for my husband and I.
    <br>Each time we were coming here, if the wise men touched him, he would run away.
    <br>I would not talk because if I talked, it would become a problem
    <br>so I would just keep quiet.
    <br>If he went out, I would be praying.
    <br>I would put Emmanuel TV on and pray, "God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>each time I am here, locate me and my husband.
    <br>If the problem is from me, let's go there.
    <br>If Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua sees us and the problem is from me,
    <br>I know the problem will be solved".
    <br>I didn't even tell him that the problem is from him; I kept on accepting it.
    <br>Even when men of God came to settle us when we were having problems
    <br>I would say that I was the problem.
    <br>I believed that one day things would be okay.
    <br>So, the first time we came here, they touched him and he started to manifest.
    <br>They told him to stay behind. He ran away.
    <br>I followed him immediately because I knew he would leave me here and go.
    <br>When I followed him and entered the car, I did not talk.
    <br>I phoned one of his friends and said, "Please, you are the only one that can help me!
    <br>Next Sunday we will come here again.
    <br>When we come, if they touch him, don't allow him to go.
    <br>Help me to hold him so that they will do the deliverance.
    <br>I know that when they will do his own, they will also do mine".
    <br>The friend accepted.
    <br>We came here together on the 26th of January.
    <br>When we came here, the same thing happened when they touched him.
    <br>He wanted to (leave). I looked at the friend and the friend said, "Don't worry".
    <br>The friend went to one of the ushers and told him, "Don't allow this man to go!"
    <br>He said, "Ok".
    <br>That is how they held him.
    <br>Testimony Time

    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>That is how they held him.
    <br>They started the deliverance and I was also praying, "God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>help me! I'm in your house today! Help me! This problem is too much for me!"
    <br>That was how they did the deliverance; things went well.
    <br>I thank God today that everything is okay between my husband and I.
    <br>I believe that even the baby that I lost,
    <br>the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua will still make me to have my own child, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>So, Madam, you mean that after your husband's deliverance, he is now a changed man?
    <br>He is now a changed man. He now loves me very much.
    <br>He tells me many things.
    <br>Even when I am cooking, he will say, "Let me come and help you". I will say, "No".
    <br>All the things he broke in the house, he brought them back under two days.
    <br>He gives me money. He takes care of me.
    <br>If I do like this, he will ask, "Are you okay?". I will say, "Yes".
    <br>Wow. Indeed the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>What a wonderful testimony of reconciliation!
    <br>Madam, throughout this terrible ten-year turbulent period with your husband,
    <br>you never left him, you stayed with him
    <br>and today we give glory to God Almighty for your life.
    <br>What is your advice to other couples?
    <br>Especially to women who are in a similar situation you were in. What is your advice to them?
    <br>My advice to all women that are in this situation that I was in before
    <br>or maybe you have gone through this problem,
    <br>the only thing is God because then, friends - everybody - would tell me, "Leave him.
    <br>File a case and go to the law court".
    <br>They said that I should go here or there.
    <br>I replied, "I will not go anywhere. I don't even have money to give to anybody to do something for me.
    <br>It is only the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua that will solve my problem".
    <br>The advice I am giving to you is to believe in God
    <br>because if you see yourself in that condition, people will be advising you to do this or that.
    <br>Don't run to anywhere.
    <br>Don't even go to any native doctor or any person because of your husband.
    <br>Keep on praying and believe that one day, God will do it.
    <br>The God that did it for me, that I am happy today, that God will do it for you, in Jesus' name!
